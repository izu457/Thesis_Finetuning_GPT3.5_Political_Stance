PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth assigns a prominent role to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (set up by Regulation (EC) 294/2008) which contributes to a number of flagship initiatives. During the period 2014-2020, the EIT will contribute to the general objective of \\\" Horizon2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, by integrating the knowledge triangle of higher education, research and innovation. This integration takes place primarily via the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together organisations on a long-term basis around societal challenges. However, given its integrated, cross\\u2013cutting nature, synergies will also be sought with other pillars, in particular the \\\"competitiveness\\\" pillar. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. On the other hand, the preparation of the proposal took account of the responses to the open consultations on the EIT. Views were expressed by the Member States and a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and civil society. It showed a strong support to the mission of the EIT to drive more and better cooperation between the worlds of academia, entrepreneurship, research and innovation. According to respondents: the EIT should play a distinctive role in 'Horizon 2020', the future EU Programme for Research and Innovation, and forge closer links with other European and national efforts; a majority of respondents praised the way in which the EIT ensures the participation of businesses in its work and urged the Institute to step up its outreach activities. Moreover, respondents considered business involvement as highly relevant for the future success of the EIT. Flexibility, clarity on rules and clear returns on investment is therefore fundamental in order to attract private sector participation; the proposal also relies on the external evaluation report in which the concept of integrating the knowledge triangle is regarded as highly relevant and the themes around which the EIT is structured are well-received; there is much support for the model which has been developed by the EIT, based around integrated networks of co-location centres. Respondents were also positive, and consistent, in their perspective that the value of the KICs was in acting as a catalyst to secure additional value from the activities which individual members already undertook. LEGAL BASIS: Article 173 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal will be implemented as centralised indirect management. The proposed amendments are based on several sources: lessons learnt during the initial period, the proposal for the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda, which builds on the proposal of the EIT Governing Board, the recommendations of the external evaluation report and Commission opinion on the evaluation, as well as the results of broad consultations with EIT stakeholders. The main amendments proposed are as follows: the financial contribution from Horizon 2020 to the EIT will be implemented in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in \\\"Horizon 2020\\\" . The EIT funding to the KICs will cover \\\"KIC added value activities\\\", however the KICs or their partner organisations may apply to other schemes under Horizon 2020 or European Union programmes in accordance with their respective rules and on equal footing with other applications; the EIT should directly engage with national and regional representatives and other stakeholders from across the innovation chain, generating beneficial effects on both sides. In order to render such dialogue and exchange more systematic, an EIT Stakeholder Forum should be organised, bringing together the wider community of stakeholders around crosscutting issues; the scope of the EIT contribution to the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (hereinafter referred to as KICs) should be defined and the origins of KICs' financial resources clarified; the composition of the EIT bodies should be simplified . The functioning of the EIT Governing Board should be streamlined and the respective roles and tasks of the Governing Board and the Director should be further clarified; new KICs , including their priority fields and the organisation and timing of the selection process, should be launched on the basis of modalities defined in the Strategic Innovation Agenda; cooperation on the organisation the monitoring and evaluations of the KICs between the Commission and the EIT is required to ensure coherence with overall EU level monitoring and evaluation system; in order to assure broader participation of organizations from different Members States in the KICs, the partner organizations should be established in at least three different Member States; the criteria and procedures for the financing, monitoring and evaluation of the activities of the KICs should be adopted by the EIT prior to launching the KIC selection process; the EIT Triennial Work Programme should take into account the Commission's opinion concerning the EIT's specific objectives, as defined in Horizon 2020, and its complementarities with European Union policies and instruments; the EIT, being under Horizon 2020, will be part of the mainstreaming of climate change expenditures as defined in Horizon 2020; the evaluation of the EIT should provide timely input to the evaluation of Horizon 2020 in 2017 and 2023; the Commission should strengthen its role in monitoring the implementation of specific aspects of EIT activities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: during the period 2014-2020 a financial contribution of EUR 3.182.230 million (current prices) for the EIT will be provided from Horizon 2020, the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020).\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 5225EP7, ECR%:0.053, EPP%:0.795, EFD/IDG%:0.194, Greens/EFA%:0.772, NI%:0.273, REG%:0.807, S&D%:0.805, The Left%:0.371, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: i n the post-Lisbon era and after the abolition of the third pillar the area of justice develops dynamically in order to respond to all challenges. Legislative and policy measures as well as their coherent implementation are key tools. Funding can contribute to the development of this area through supporting legislation and policy-making and promoting their implementation. In accordance with the Communication on the EU Budget Review, a fresh look was taken at the existing funding instruments and delivery mechanisms to ensure clear focus on European added value and to cater for rationalisation and simplification of the funding mechanisms. In \\u2018A Budget for Europe 2020\\u2019, the Commission identified the need for a simpler and more transparent budget to overcome the problems that arise from the complexity of programme structures and the existence of multiple programmes. The area of Rights was mentioned as an example of the existing fragmentation, where action should be taken. Within this framework and aiming at simplification and rationalisation, the Rights and Citizenship Programme is the successor of three current programmes: Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Daphne III, The Sections \\\"Antidiscrimination and Diversity\\\" and \\\"Gender Equality\\\" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS). The merge of these programmes will allow for a comprehensive funding approach in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: one impact assessment was carried out concerning the future funding activities for the whole area of justice, rights and equality, which currently comprises six programmes ( Civil Justice Programme, the Criminal Justice Programme, the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Daphne III Programme, the Drug Prevention and Information Programme and the sections \\\"Antidiscrimination and Diversity\\\" and \\\"Gender Equality\\\" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity ( PROGRESS )). The impact assessment has considered three options: Option A: to maintain six programmes and to address some of the identified problems through changes in the internal management of the programmes.; Option B: to maintain all measures of option A and additionally to merge the current six programmes into two programmes. This option would allow for flexibility in the use of funds and in addressing annual policy priorities. It would achieve increased simplification (both for the beneficiaries and the administration) and efficiency of the programmes, since significantly fewer procedures would be needed. The effectiveness of the programmes would also be improved as the fragmentation and dilution of funds would be addressed better within two programmes. Human resources could be freed, since fewer procedures would reduce the administrative burden and they would be allocated to activities improving the effectiveness of the programmes (dissemination of results, monitoring, providing information, etc). Option C: to implement only one programme. This option addresses all problems caused by the multiple legal instruments and by the increased administrative burden of managing multiple programmes. However, due to legal constraints the scope of this programme would not be able to cover the funding needs of all policy areas. A choice would have to be made between the area of justice and the area of rights and citizenship. Although this solution can deliver maximum impact in terms of management, however it would not be possible to address sufficiently the policy priorities and needs of the whole policy area. Resulting from the analysis and comparison of the options, the preferred option is the implementation of two programmes which would cover the funding needs of all policy areas (option B). In comparison to the status quo option B presents clear advantages and no disadvantage. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(1) and (2), Article 82(1) and Article 84 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission proposes to establish a new European Union programme on Justice 2014-2020. General objective : the general objective of the Programme shall be to contribute to the creation of a European area of justice by promoting judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. To achieve the general objective, the Programme shall have the following specific objectives: to promote effective, comprehensive and consistent application of Union legislation in the areas of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters; to facilitate access to justice; to prevent and reduce drug demand and supply. The proposal states that the indicator to measure the achievement of this objective shall be, inter alia, the number of cases of trans-border cooperation. The Programme shall aim to promote equality between women and men and combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in all its activities. Actions financed : the Programme shall finance inter alia the following types of actions: analytical activities , such as collection of data and statistics; development of common methodologies and, where appropriate, indicators or benchmarks; studies, researches, analyses and surveys; evaluations and impact assessments; training activities , such as staff exchanges, workshops, seminars, train-the-trainers events; mutual learning, cooperation, awareness raising and dissemination activities , such as identification of, and exchanges on, good practices, innovative approaches and experiences, organisation of peer review and mutual learning; support for main actors , such as support for Member States when implementing Union law and policies; support for key European level networks whose activities are linked to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme; funding of experts' networks; funding of European level observatories. European added value : the Commission shall ensure that the actions selected for funding are intended to produce results with European added value and shall monitor whether European added value was actually achieved through the final results of the actions financed by the Programme. Implementation : in implementing this Regulation the Commission will establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. The Programme can make use of all financial instruments foreseen in the Financial Regulation. The Commission may use, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, an existing executive agency for the implementation of the programme, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes. The programme may share resources with other Union instruments, in particular the Rights and Citizens Programme, in order to implement actions meeting the objectives of both programmes. Participation of the programme : ac cess to the Programme shall be open to all public and/or private bodies and entities legally established in: (a) Member States; (b) EFTA countries which are party to the EEA Agreement; (c) accession countries, candidate countries and potential candidates;(d) Denmark, on the basis of an international agreement. Under the Programme, the Commission may cooperate with international organisations active in the areas covered by the Programme, such as the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Access to the Programme shall be open to those international organisations. Monitoring and evaluation : the Commission shall monitor the Programme regularly. The monitoring will also provide a means of assessing the way in which gender equality and anti-discrimination issues have been addressed across the programme\\u2019s activities.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. CONTENT: the Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/352 which establishes a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports. It is proposed that the new transitional provision shall provide Member States with the option to allow managing bodies of a port or competent authorities to decide whether to:  waive (condone, i.e. not require the payment at all); or suspend (freeze or put on hold the payment for a certain time period); or reduce (decrease the payment); or defer (require the payment at a later point in time) the payment of the port infrastructure charges. As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. This new provision also stipulates that the managing body of a port or the competent authority shall ensure that port users and the representatives or associations of port users are informed accordingly. The time limit of two months referred to in Regulation (EU) 2017/352 shall not apply.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 1026EP9, ECR%:0.323, EPP%:0.918, EFD/IDG%:0.863, Greens/EFA%:0.081, NI%:0.579, REG%:0.907, S&D%:0.792, The Left%:0.537, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lays down the list of third countries whose national must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (\\u201cnegative list\\u201d) and those whose national are exempt from that requirement (\\u201cpositive list\\u201d). The determination of those third countries or territories whose citizens are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating, among other things, to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the European Union's external relations with third countries or territories. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity, and particular attention is paid to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries or territories concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries or territories, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed regularly. The present review of the Regulation aims at: ensure that the composition of the lists of third countries and territories complies with the criteria set out in recital 5 of the Regulation, in particular as regards the illegal immigration and public policy criteria and the external relations criterion, and transferring countries from one annex to another as appropriate; ensure that, in accordance with Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU, the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country or territory citizen is to be subject to or exempt from the visa requirement. As a result, a new modified version of Regulation (EC) No 239/2001 is proposed in order to include a certain number of states in the Regulation\\u2019s positive and negative lists. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU. CONTENT: in accordance with the approach followed in the context of previous amendments to Regulation (EC) No. 539/2001, it is proposed to: transfer Taiwan to the positive list: despite the fact that the EU does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state and has no diplomatic or formal relations with Taiwan, the EU has developed regular contacts and cooperation in a number of areas with the Taiwanese authorities. As a result, the EU is the largest foreign investor in Taiwan. Upon analysis, it became apparent that transferring Taiwan to the positive list would reinforce regional coherence as the EU grants visa free regime to other countries and entities of the region. As regards migration, the risk of illegal immigration from Taiwan is very low On that basis, imposing a visa requirement on the nationals of Taiwan is no longer justified; transfer of the Northern Mariana Islands to the positive list : the Northern Mariana Islands are a commonwealth in political union with the United States of America, and the head of the state of Northern Mariana is the president of the United States. The citizens of the Islands have US passports. Following from the above information, the reference to the Northern Mariana Islands should be deleted from Annex I. This will entail that the citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands, as US nationals, enjoy visa-free travel. Lastly, it should be noted that the draft Regulation proposes a new Part 4 under Annex II : this is entitled \\u201cEntities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as States by at least one Member State,\\u201d and the list is comprised of Taiwan.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an environment marked by the emergence of new threats, such as hybrid and cyber-attacks, and the return of more conventional dangers, EU citizens and their political leaders agree that the EU should collectively take more responsibility for its security. The defence sector is largely fragmented across national borders , with considerable duplication, resulting in inefficiencies that prevent economies of scale. At the same time, the cost of defence equipment and in particular R&D costs have increased, while cooperation between Member States on investment in R&D and defence equipment has remained limited. In 2015, only 16% of defence equipment was procured through European collaborative procurement. In June 2017, the Commission adopted a communication launching the European Defence Fund consisting of 'windows' for research and for capability. The communication was accompanied by a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing the European defence industrial development programme under the capability window. A two-step approach was proposed, involving: an initial test period under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework during which a preparatory action on defence research supports collaborative defence research, while the proposed European defence industrial development programme shall co-finance collaborative development projects; and a dedicated fund under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework scaling up the funding for collaborative research in innovative defence products and technologies and for subsequent stages of the development cycle, including the development of prototypes. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - concerns the establishment of the European defence fund under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 with a view to fostering the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European defence industry and technological base and thus contributing to the strategic autonomy of the Union. The new fund shall promote cooperation between Member States and contribute to cost savings in the production of interoperable and advanced defence technologies and equipment. Its objective shall be: support collaborative research projects that could significantly boost the performance of future capabilities, aiming at maximising innovation and introducing new defence products and technologies, including disruptive ones; support collaborative development projects of defence products and technologies consistent with defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It shall contribute to greater efficiency of defence spending within the Union, achieving greater economies of scale, reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication and as such reducing the fragmentation of defence products and technologies throughout the Union. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation shall enable the Commission to set up a financing programme, implemented mainly through grants awarded following annual calls for proposals. Cross-border participation of SMEs and mid-cap companies shall be encouraged by offering higher financing rates. To be eligible, actions shall, in principle, be carried out in cooperation between at least three legal entities based in at least three different Member States and/or associated countries. Furthermore, the EU shall only co-finance the development of common prototypes if Member States commit themselves to buying the final product. Once assessed as eligible, a 'PESCO bonus', in the form of a higher funding rate, shall be granted to eligible permanent structured cooperation in defence projects. The fund shall also take into account defence activities implemented through the European peace facility, an off-budget instrument proposed outside the multi-annual financial framework. Proposed budget : the Fund shall have an overall budget of EUR 13 billion (at current prices) for the period 2021-2027, of which: Up to 5% of the financial envelope shall be devoted to support disruptive technologies for defence.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 8622EP8, ECR%:0.371, EPP%:0.81, EFD/IDG%:0.021, Greens/EFA%:0.08, NI%:0.038, REG%:0.806, S&D%:0.372, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down common rules for the basic payment scheme and related payments. It seeks to better target support to certain actions, areas or beneficiaries as well as to pave the way for convergence of the level of support within and across Member States. The regulation also includes a section on coupled support. (1) A single scheme across the EU, the basic payment scheme, replaces the Single Payment Scheme and the Single Area Payment Scheme as from 2014. The scheme will operate on the basis of payment entitlements allocated at national or regional level to all farmers according to their eligible hectares in the first year of application. (2) The definition of active farmer further enhances targeting on farmers genuinely engaged in agricultural activities, and thus legitimizes support. In addition, the progressive reduction and capping of support for large beneficiaries is foreseen while taking due account of employment. (3) The following payments are also provided: \\u00b7 a payment (30% of annual national ceiling) for farmers following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment: crop diversification, maintenance of permanent pastures and ecological focus areas. Organic farming automatically benefits from this payment, while farmers in Natura 2000 areas will have to comply with the relevant requirements to the extent that they are consistent with the Natura 2000 legislation; \\u00b7 a voluntary payment (up to 5% of annual national ceiling) for farmers in areas facing specific natural constraints (areas delimited in the same manner as for rural development purposes); this payment recognizes the need for income support to maintain presence in areas facing specific natural constraints and complements existing support under rural development; \\u00b7 a payment (up to 2% of annual national ceiling) for young farmers in their installation, which may be complemented by setting up aid under rural development. At the same time, the Regulation: lays down a simplified scheme for small farmers (up to 10% of annual national ceiling), who may thus receive a lump sum payment replacing all direct payments and producing administrative simplification with an easing of such farmers' obligations related to greening, cross compliance and controls; provides a voluntary coupled support scheme for specific types of farming or specific agricultural systems which are experiencing certain difficulties and which are particularly important for economic and/or social reasons; support is provided to the extent necessary to maintain current levels of production (up to 5% of annual national ceiling with the possibility to go beyond this in particular cases); maintain the possibility for Complementary National Direct Payments for Bulgaria and Romania and includes a specific payment for cotton. In terms of simplification, the new direct payments system will be based on a single type of payment entitlements and streamline transfer rules, thereby simplifying its management. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 5199EP7, ECR%:0.14, EPP%:0.81, EFD/IDG%:0.097, Greens/EFA%:0.105, NI%:0.333, REG%:0.687, S&D%:0.682, The Left%:0.029, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, maritime safety and security, search and rescue operations, fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The objective of this initiative is to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency should therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coastguard functions to increase maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. CONTENT: this legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes proposals for a Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency. The proposal stipulates that the EMSA shall, in cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Fisheries Control Agency, support national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at international level by: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the agencies, in accordance with their respective legal bases and without prejudice to the ownership of data by Member States; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building by elaborating guidelines , recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhancing the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative requires an increase in the EU contribution to EMSA of around EUR 22 million per year (that is around EUR 87 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 17 TA staff. This is operational expenditure for around EUR 81 million mainly to cover provision of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) services for border control surveillance (EUR 67 million) and satellite aerial surveillance (SAT-AIS) and Satcom data and services to increase the surveillance capability of the 3 agencies and national authorities to strengthen as a primary objective the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 3663EP8, ECR%:0.6, EPP%:0.932, EFD/IDG%:0.375, Greens/EFA%:0.96, NI%:0.154, REG%:0.985, S&D%:0.932, The Left%:0.019, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid \\\"in beneficiary countries\\\", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the EIDHR and on the parallel proposal amending the DCI.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 2378EP7, ECR%:0.789, EPP%:0.842, EFD/IDG%:0.548, Greens/EFA%:0.895, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.867, S&D%:0.8, The Left%:0.057, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the consequences of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for farmers and rural businesses are unprecedented. Mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments have led to economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances. CONTENT: the proposal includes limited and targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 providing exceptional and temporary support to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, which are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Exceptional temporary support Support under this measure shall consist of temporary emergency aid to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis to ensure the continuity of their activities. It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 1353EP9, ECR%:1.016, EPP%:0.973, EFD/IDG%:0.836, Greens/EFA%:0.919, NI%:0.649, REG%:0.935, S&D%:0.929, The Left%:0.927, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUD: in a crisis where EUR 4 588.9 billion of taxpayer money was committed to support banks between October 2008 and October 2009 and where such aid accounted for 39% of EU 27 GDP in 2009, all components of the financial system need to be improved. Robust audit is key to re-establishing trust and market confidence. It contributes to investor protection by providing easily accessible, cost-effective and trustworthy information about the financial statements of companies. It also potentially reduces the cost of capital for audited companies by ensuring more transparency and reliability of financial statements. It is also important to stress that auditors are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits. EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit through Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts. However, the high degree of concentration in audit market and the multitude of approval procedures necessary to provide cross-border statutory audits prevent small and medium-sized audit firms from benefiting from the internal market. The following problems are examined: \\u00a7  a high level of administrative burden resulting from fragmented national regulation; \\u00a7  the provision of cross-border statutory audits is allowed only if an auditor passes an aptitude test and gets approved and registered in every Member State; \\u00a7  a lack of common standards across the EU on audit practice, independence, internal control of audit firms; \\u00a7  auditing standards do not take into account the size of the audited companies, in particular of SMEs; \\u00a7  associated problems regarding supervision of non-PIEs. This proposal on amending Directive 2006/43/EC aims to improve the internal market on statutory audits. It will coexist with a proposal for a regulation on the specific requirements on the statutory audit of public-interest entities. The two proposals are part of the ongoing regulatory reform in various domains of the financial sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment concluded that the best options to improve the existing situation would be: \\u00a7  facilitation of the cross-border recognition of audit providers' competence; \\u00a7  streamlining of the standards on audit practice, independence and internal control of audit firms across the Union; \\u00a7  adaptation of audit standards to the size of the audited entity by requesting Member States to ensure that a proportionate and simplified audit for SMEs is possible. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal contains amendments to the provisions on the approval and registration of auditors and audit firms, on the existing principles in Directive 2006/43/EC regarding professional ethics, professional secrecy, independence and reporting as well as the associated supervision rules that remain applicable for the audit of non-public-interest entities (non- PIEs). The main modifications to the Directive are: Articulation between the Directive and an additional legal instrument on specific requirements for the statutory audit of PIEs : the proposal deals with the applicability of the amended Directive to the statutory audit of PIEs. Certain provisions apply to statutory auditors and audit firms, irrespective of the type of audited entity. However, for the rest of the Articles of the Directive, the situation is different: clauses on independence and objectivity, audit fees, audit reporting, quality assurance, investigations and penalties would not apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. On these specific issues more detailed rules would be enacted in the Regulation. Definition of \\\"statutory audit\\\" in order to take account of the new Accountancy Directive : the new definition will continue to cover the instances where different Union legal texts impose an obligation on some undertakings to have their financial statements audited, depending on their legal form or on their activity. In order to guarantee the \\u201cunicity\\u201d of audit, the definition of \\\"statutory audit\\\" should also cover situations where Member States decide to impose an obligation on small undertakings to have their financial statements audited. Lastly, where a small undertaking decides voluntarily to have its financial statements audited, such audit should also be considered a statutory audit. Modification of the ownership rules : currently, the Directive requires that a majority of the voting rights in an audit firm is held by licensed accountant practitioners. This requirement is no longer stipulated in the proposed amendment and Member States are forbidden to require that a minimum of capital or of voting rights in an audit firm is held by statutory auditors or audit firms. However, the proposal maintains the existing requirement that a majority of the members of the administrative or management body of the audit firm are audit firms or statutory auditors. Passport for audit firms : the proposal for an amended Directive would allow audit firms to provide statutory audits in Member States other than the Member State in which they have been approved, provided that the key audit partner leading the audit is approved as an auditor in the Member State concerned. However, once approval is obtained in the home Member State, the host Member State may require some form of registration of audit firms from other Member States. Passport for statutory auditors and \\\"softening\\\" the conditions for a statutory auditor to be approved in a different Member State : the proposed modifications regarding the approval of statutory auditors from other Member States are aligned with the provisions of the Directive 2005/36 on the recognition of professional qualifications. \\u00a7  The proposal would allow statutory auditors to provide cross-border statutory audit services on a temporary or occasional basis. The conditions set out in the Professional Qualifications Directive would apply, notably the obligation to communicate the intention to provide the services in question to the relevant competent authority. \\u00a7  A Member State will be able to offer the statutory auditor who is approved in another Member State the choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test, if such auditor wants to set up a permanent establishment in that Member State. The test should be aimed at assessing the statutory auditor's knowledge of the laws and regulations of that Member State that are relevant for the carrying out of the statutory audit. \\u00a7  During the adaptation period, which should be offered to the applicant as an alternative to the aptitude test, the statutory auditor would be allowed to conduct statutory audit in the Member State, other than the one in which he or she is approved, under the supervision of a local auditor. The length of the adaptation period is three years. Requirements to competent authorities to cooperate regarding educational requirements and aptitude test : in order to ensure more convergence of the educational qualifications of auditors at Union level, the competent national authorities in charge of the public oversight for statutory auditors must cooperate. Cooperation at Union level is also necessary to harmonise the requirements of the aptitude test. Auditing standards and audit reporting : the proposal requires Member States to ensure that statutory auditors and audit firms carry out audits in accordance with the international auditing standards. New rules regarding competent authorities : currently, the Directive requires Member States to organise a system of public oversight for statutory auditors and audit firms. The new amendment states that the competent authority responsible for public oversight will be a public authority that will be also responsible for approval, registration and quality assurance. The competent authority responsible for the public oversight may delegate some of its tasks to other authorities or bodies with regard to the approval and registration of the statutory auditors and audit firms. Such delegation must be subject to several conditions and the body that bears the ultimate responsibility is the competent authority. Prohibition of contractual clauses: the proposal prohibits clauses according to which a third party suggests, recommends or requires the audited entity to appoint a specific statutory auditor or audit firm. Special rules for the statutory audit of small and medium-sized undertakings : following the recent Commission proposal, small undertakings would no longer be required by EU law to have their financial statements audited, although Member States may still require it. However, the requirement will continue to apply to medium-sized undertakings. When medium-sized undertakings are audited pursuant to EU law, the amended Directive requires Member States to ensure that the way in which the auditing standards are applied are adapted to the dimension and scale of those undertakings. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the European Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 6523EP7, ECR%:0.684, EPP%:0.802, EFD/IDG%:0.29, Greens/EFA%:0.018, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.771, S&D%:0.005, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: information society services and especially intermediary services have become an important part of the EU\\u2019s economy and daily life of Union citizens. Twenty years after the adoption of the existing legal framework applicable to such services laid down in e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, new and innovative business models and services, such as online social networks and marketplaces, have allowed business users and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. A majority of EU citizens now use those services on a daily basis. However, the digital transformation and increased use of those services has also resulted in new risks and challenges, both for individual users and for society as a whole. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more specifically, intermediary services). It aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the EU, by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member States have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. The proposed regulation lays down harmonised rules on the provision of intermediary services in the internal market. In particular, it establishes: - a framework for the conditional exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services; - rules on specific due diligence obligations tailored to certain specific categories of providers of intermediary services; - rules on the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, including as regards the cooperation of and coordination between the competent authorities. This proposal should apply to intermediary services provided to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or residence in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment of the providers of those services. Specific provisions The proposal lays down: - measures to counter illegal goods, services or content online, such as a mechanism for users to flag such content and for platforms to cooperate with \\u2018trusted flaggers\\u2019; - new obligations on traceability of business users in online marketplaces, to help identify sellers of illegal goods; - effective safeguards for users, including the possibility to challenge platforms\\u2019 content moderation decisions; - transparency measures for online platforms on a variety of issues, including on the algorithms used for recommendations; - obligations for very large platforms to prevent the misuse of their systems by taking risk-based action and by independent audits of their risk management systems; - access for researchers to key data of the largest platforms, in order to understand how online risks evolve; - oversight structures to address the complexity of the online space: EU countries will have the primary role, supported by a new European Board for Digital Services; for very large platforms, enhanced supervision and enforcement by the Commission.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Opening of tariff quotas : the Union negotiated tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The proposal aims therefore to open annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. Management : the Commission: should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adoption of amendments to this Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision concluding an agreement with one or more third countries; should adopt, by means of implementing acts, rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this Regulation and, as appropriate, provisions: (a) guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; (b) relating to the recognition of the document allowing the guarantees referred to in point (a) to be verified; and (c) on the issue of import licences and their period of validity.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 441EP8, ECR%:0.871, EPP%:0.946, EFD/IDG%:0.438, Greens/EFA%:0.98, NI%:0.173, REG%:0.955, S&D%:0.942, The Left%:0.788, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: the scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008, carried out in 2011, stated that the cod plan has not achieved its objectives and that they are unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Furthermore, the report revealed that there are flaws in the design of the Regulation and problems with its implementation. The Commission is proposing an amendment to the Regulation in the light of this advice and of the opinions received from Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and the Member States. The proposal for the amendment of the Regulation does not cover all the problems identified since this amendment is intended as an interim solution pending the development and implementation of a mixed-fishery plan for North Sea fisheries as anticipated in the reform. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal was drawn up on the basis of consultations with the Member States and stakeholders. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENTS: the main legal action is as far as possible to improve and clarify the provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 that were identified in the evaluation as problematic, in particular: \\u00b7  the changes to Article 4 (Calculation of fishing effort) aim at closing the unintended possibility for Member States to deploy higher levels of effort than the plan was meant to allow simply by changing the methods used for the calculation of effort when establishing the baselines and when calculating usage; \\u00b7  Article 9 (Special procedure for setting TACs) defines a procedure for TAC setting in the absence of the necessary information to apply Article 7 or 8. Instead of automatic reductions of 25% it is proposed to take a case-by-case, and therefore a more flexible, approach though remaining firmly based on available scientific advice; \\u00b7  instead of exempting groups of vessels specified by each Member State, exemptions are now based on criteria that would be generally applicable for any vessels that meet them, regardless of the Member State to which they belong. The amended Article also avoids the need for constant adjustments of the baseline by Council; \\u00b7  transitional measures will ensure that vessels groups already excluded will be subject to the criteria in force at the time of exclusion; \\u00b7  vessels involved in the fully documented fishery trials , where all catches are counted against quota, are exempted from fishing effort regime; \\u00b7  a new proposal foresees the possibility for the Council to decide not to apply further fishing effort reductions, once the fishing-effort ceiling has been reduced for four consecutive years; \\u00b7  it is now made clear that the condition that cod catch are less than 5 % of the total refers to the catch composition over the management period, not per trip; \\u00b7  in Article 14, the Member State obligation to address the discard issue is strengthened since it is not the case under the current ruling, and level of control and monitoring is specified according to risk-based management; \\u00b7  the Committee procedure is brought into line with the rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 4200EP7, ECR%:0.86, EPP%:0.89, EFD/IDG%:0.581, Greens/EFA%:0.07, NI%:0.606, REG%:0.831, S&D%:0.867, The Left%:0.571, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the present proposal takes into account recent legislative and political developments regarding the Financial Regulation (FR). For the sake of legal clarity and in order to facilitate the negotiations of the European Parliament and the Council, it merges and replaces two earlier Commission proposals on the revision of the FR in a single text and under a standard legislative format (no recast). These two earlier proposals concerned on the one hand, the triennial revision of the Financial Regulation and, on the other hand, the revision of the FR to align it with the Lisbon Treaty , including the obligations of Member States concerning internal control and audit and their resulting responsibilities in shared management. Therefore, these two earlier proposals are withdrawn. Additionally, the proposal also incorporates the changes to the FR due to the adoption of the Regulation No 1081/2010 regarding the creation of the European External Action Service ('EEAS'). LEGAL BASE AND PROCEDURE: since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the FR is to be revised in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure in Article 322 TFEU. In order to allow the legislative authority to have a global view of the proposed modifications, the Implementing Rules of the Financial Regulation (IR) are presented, in a Commission Staff working document, together with the FR in a single package. The IR, which contains more detailed provisions complementing the FR, will be adopted under the delegated powers of the Commission according to Article 290 TFEU. The present proposal does not contain any change of substance compared to the two earlier proposals , which are: (i) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Union; (ii) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. As a consequence, the working document of the Commission services concerning the Implementing Rules to the FR, which has been put forward by the Commission together with the triennial revision, remains entirely valid. CONTENT: in 2011 more than EUR 126 billion is planned for allocation to EU policies benefiting the Union and its citizens. In the current economic context it is even more important that the delivery mechanisms of the budget operate in the most efficient way and facilitate the implementation of EU policies, while securing sound treatment of European taxpayers' money. In particular, it is important that these mechanisms are: (i) simple and transparent (especially to final recipients of EU funds); (ii) provide the possibility for leverage of non-EU budget resources and at the same time (iii) strengthen the Commission's accountability for implementation of the budget. (1) Need for a reform : reform is necessary with a view to adapting the financial rules to the new requirements of budget implementation (co-financing with other donors, specific financial instruments, PPPs) or where the basic principles create disproportionate workload (interests on pre-financing) or may unduly impede efficiency (prohibition of budget implementation through private sector bodies). The award of small grants and contracts also needs to be facilitated. Furthermore, the new procedure applicable to the IR, as set out in the Lisbon Treaty, should lead to a new articulation between the FR and the IR, imposing a complete review of the whole set of financial rules. In this context, the Commission has based its proposal on the following objectives: \\u00b7 to introduce more flexibility in the application of budgetary principles, which should better suit operational needs and alleviate unnecessary administrative burden for recipients of Union funds; \\u00b7 to streamline relations with implementing partners to which the Commission entrusts the management of programmes or part of programming actions (projects), in particular taking account of the nature of the implementing partner (Member States, agencies, EIB, public and private operators, etc.) and the financial risks entailed (proportionality); \\u00b7 to shift the regime of grants from a real-cost based management (inputs) towards a performance-based scheme (outputs), in order to better target policy objectives and achieve significant simplification of procedural and documentary requirements for the benefit of beneficiaries, and facilitate the use of lump sums; \\u00b7 to ensure sound financial management while leaving significant room for manoeuvre for Authorising Officers so that they can adapt the means to their operational constraints and the financial risks they are faced with; \\u00b7 to modernise the system of risk management and control measures so as to make them more proportional to the probability of errors and to the cost involved. (2) Alignment with the Lisbon Treaty : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union \\u2013 (TFEU), which entered into force on December 1, 2009, makes important changes concerning budgetary and financial issues. These changes should be translated in the Financial Regulation and concern in particular: \\u00b7 the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the Treaty, and its link to annual budgetary procedure: in this regard, as a consequence of the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the TFEU, some provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management should be introduced in the Financial Regulation; \\u00b7 the new annual budgetary procedure and the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, which have an impact on the provisions relating to transfers and the provisional twelfths; \\u00b7 the new provisions introduced in Article 317 TFEU concerning the control and audit obligations of the Member States in the implementation of the budget, together with Point 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. The proposal also allows for the streamlining of the Financial Regulation in line with the Lisbon Treaty, through both technical adaptations and the deletion of obsolete provisions. TIMETABLE: the present revision of the FR occurs while preparation for the post-2013 programmes is also under way. It is important that all the actors concerned in the legislative process maintain an ambitious timetable for the present revision. They should aim at an agreement on the package (Financial Regulation and Implementing Rules) so that it could enter into application on 1 January 2012.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 3254EP7, ECR%:0.596, EPP%:0.813, EFD/IDG%:0.194, Greens/EFA%:0.754, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.723, S&D%:0.779, The Left%:0.029, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the international maritime safety conventions require flag States to ensure that the equipment carried on board ships complies with certain safety requirements as regards design, construction and performance, and to issue the relevant certificates. To that end, detailed performance and testing standards for certain types of marine equipment have been developed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and by the international and European standardisation bodies. The international instruments leave a significant margin of discretion to the flag administrations . Back in 1995, the Commission clearly identified the problems encountered in the Internal Market as a result of this state of affairs and in the absence of EU harmonisation in the marine equipment sector. Council Directive 96/98/EC on marine equipment (MED) thus laid down common rules to eliminate differences in the implementation of international standards by means of a clearly identified set of requirements and uniform certification procedures. Experience has shown that it is necessary to take additional measures in order to enhance the implementation and enforcement mechanisms of the said Directive and simplify the regulatory environment while guaranteeing that IMO requirements are applied and implemented in a harmonised way across the Union. Decision No 768/2008 (New Legislative Framework) constitutes a general framework of a horizontal nature for future legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products and a reference text for existing legislation. This general framework provides appropriate solutions to the problems identified in the implementation of Directive 96/98/EC. It is therefore necessary to incorporate the definitions and reference provisions of Decision No 768/2008 into this Directive by making the adaptations which are required by the specific features of the marine equipment sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on two alternatives to the baseline (statu quo) scenario, namely: (i) a maximum alignment with the new legislative framework; and (ii) conditional alignment, allowing for a number of MED-specific measures in order to cater for the sector's particular features. The analysis showed that conditional alignment was the most effective and least burdensome solution and, at the same time, it had the most positive overall economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish requirements for marine equipment to meet the safety standards laid down in the applicable international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, in order to ensure that equipment which complies with these requirements can circulate unimpeded within the Internal Market and be placed on board ships flying the flag of any Member State . Scope : the scope of the Directive is defined by reference to equipment which is (a) due to be installed on board a ship flying the flag of a Member State , and (b) for which the approval of the flag State is required by the international conventions. Requirements for marine equipment : these are defined by reference to the international conventions and instruments. As required by these, demonstration of compliance is confined to the specific applicable testing standards. Given the need to ensure continued consistency with the international regulatory framework, these requirements and standards must apply in their up-to-date version. Responsibility : the proposal provides that the flag State has the responsibility to ensure that only equipment which has been duly approved in accordance with the then applicable requirements of the international instruments is placed on board ships flying its flag. In addition, the proposed Directive: provides the basis for the free movement of marine equipment within the EU, based on the concept of mutual recognition between Member States of equipment complying with the requirements laid down in the Directive; reflects the priority given to the international regulation of maritime safety, consistent with the global nature of shipping; governs the particular case of the transfer of a ship to a Member State's register based on the principle of compliance with the Directive\\u2019s requirements; established rules and conditions for affixing the wheel mark; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards the specific obligations of the economic operators; lists the conformity-checking procedures made available to manufacturers; aligns the Directive with Decision 768/2008 as regards the EU declaration of conformity; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards notification, notifying authorities, notified bodies and their respective regimes; fully aligns the Directive with the general EU market surveillance framework, including as regards the safeguard procedure. Checks on board may be necessary and are therefore regulated; contains the specific regime in exceptional circumstances, largely taken from the existing Directive. This regime concerns exemptions in cases of technical innovation or for the purpose of testing and evaluation. Lastly, as regards the implementation measures, the Commission: shall be empowered to uniformly implement the requirement for marine equipment to comply with the specific design, construction and performance requirements laid down in the international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, as defined by the Legislator; is also empowered to adopt common criteria and procedures for the application of these requirements and standards; is charged with the task of gathering and publishing a significant package of information. This codifies and expands existing practice and will facilitate the implementation of the Directive by all actors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The tasks devolved to the Commission, including those for which the assistance of the European Maritime Safety Agency is foreseen, are not expected to represent an increase in workload and will be carried out with existing resources. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Vote ID: 6781EP7, ECR%:0.895, EPP%:0.821, EFD/IDG%:0.419, Greens/EFA%:0.93, NI%:0.303, REG%:0.783, S&D%:0.79, The Left%:0.8, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0\"}]}\n",
