This research analyses how fine-tuning can improve the ability of ChatGPT3.5 to detect and predict political stance in legislation and to further generate amendments of counterfactual political stance.
Legislation voted on by the European Parliament between 2009 and 2022 has been scraped from the Parliament's websites as summaries and combined with the voting records compiled by Simon Hix within the project VoteWatch.eu.
ChatGPT3.5 has been trained on the summaries and voting records to recognize the supporting political majority and party percentages. High increase in accuracy was achieved when comparing to a baseline version of ChatGPT3.5.
This research is part of a Master Thesis.
