      "It applies from 21 December 2024.\n",
      "BACKGROUND \n",
      "Green bonds are one of the main ways of financing investment in green technology,  energy and resource efficiency and sustainable transport and research infrastructure. They help implement the EU’s transition to a climate-neutral,  resource-efficient economy.\n",
      "The regulation fosters consistency and comparability in the green bond market and reduces the risk of greenwashing,  for the benefit of both issuers and investors. \n",
      "KEY TERMS \n",
      "Taxonomy. An investment classification system containing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities.\n",
      "Securitisation. The practice of pooling together various types of debt and selling them as bonds to investors.\n",
      "Synthetic securitisation. The transfer of risk by using credit derivatives or guarantees with exposure remaining with the originator.\n",
      "Environmentally sustainable. A bond with a commitment that the proceeds go to environmental activities.\n",
      "Sustainability-linked. A bond with defined environmental sustainability objectives.\";\"Summary of the Legislation:\n",
      "Title: \"\"Act to Promote Green Bonds in the European Union\"\"\n",
      "Background: Green bonds are financial instruments aimed at raising capital for projects with environmental benefits,  such as renewable energy and pollution control. Amid increasing urgency to address climate change,  this legislation seeks to integrate these bonds into the broader financial system of the EU,  promoting a transition towards a sustainable green economy.\n",
      "Aims: The legislation is designed to facilitate the funding of environmentally sustainable projects through the issuance of green bonds,  aiming to attract both private and public sector investment.\n",
      "Scope and Addressees: The law targets financial institutions,  corporate issuers,  and public sector entities across the EU that are involved in the issuance,  investment,  and regulation of securities,  specifically green bonds.\n",
      "Key Provisions:\n",
      "1.\tDefinition and Eligibility Criteria:\n",
      "o\tSet strict guidelines defining eligible green bond projects,  focusing on environmental sustainability and climate impact.\n",
      "o\tInvolve the European Investment Bank (EIB) in validating project eligibility.\n",
      "2.\tDisclosure and Reporting Requirements:\n",
      "o\tMandate issuers to provide detailed disclosures on the use of proceeds and expected environmental benefits.\n",
      "o\tRequire annual impact reports to be reviewed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).\n",
      "3.\tRegulatory Oversight:\n",
      "o\tDesignate ESMA to oversee the compliance of green bond issuances,  ensuring adherence to EU standards.\n",
      "o\tEstablish penalties for non-compliance to be enforced by national financial regulators,  within the framework set by ESMA.\n",
      "4.\tMarket Incentives:\n",
      "o\tPropose tax incentives for investors in green bonds,  subject to approval and implementation by individual member states.\n",
      "o\tEncourage member states to align national tax benefits with these EU guidelines to ensure consistency.\n",
      "5.\tInternational Standards Integration:\n",
      "o\tAlign the EU green bond criteria with international standards to enhance market compatibility and investor confidence.\n",
      "o\tFacilitate cross-border investment in green bonds within the EU and globally.\n",
      "Entry into Force: The legislation is scheduled to come into effect on January 1,  2026,  providing time for issuers and regulators to adapt to the new regulations.\n",
      "European and National Jurisdiction Considerations:\n",
      "•\tThe EU sets overarching regulatory frameworks and standards,  but implementation of specific tax incentives remains under the jurisdiction of individual member states.\n",
      "•\tThe EU cannot mandate specific environmental projects or local economic activities; it only provides a framework and standards for what qualifies as a green bond eligible project.\n",

    "\"\"\"Summary of the Legislation:\n",
    "Title: \"Act to Promote Green Bonds in the European Union\"\n",
    "Background: Green bonds are financial instruments aimed at raising capital for projects with environmental benefits, such as renewable energy and pollution control. Amid increasing urgency to address climate change, this legislation seeks to integrate these bonds into the broader financial system of the EU, promoting a transition towards a sustainable green economy.\n",
    "Aims: The legislation is designed to facilitate the funding of environmentally sustainable projects through the issuance of green bonds, aiming to attract both private and public sector investment.\n",
    "Scope and Addressees: The law targets financial institutions, corporate issuers, and public sector entities across the EU that are involved in the issuance, investment, and regulation of securities, specifically green bonds.\n",
    "Key Provisions:\n",
    "1.\tDefinition and Eligibility Criteria:\n",
    "o\tSet strict guidelines defining eligible green bond projects, focusing on environmental sustainability and climate impact.\n",
    "o\tInvolve the European Investment Bank (EIB) in validating project eligibility.\n",
    "2.\tDisclosure and Reporting Requirements:\n",
    "o\tMandate issuers to provide detailed disclosures on the use of proceeds and expected environmental benefits.\n",
    "o\tRequire annual impact reports to be reviewed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).\n",
    "3.\tRegulatory Oversight:\n",
    "o\tDesignate ESMA to oversee the compliance of green bond issuances, ensuring adherence to EU standards.\n",

    "Entry into Force: The legislation is scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 2026, providing time for issuers and regulators to adapt to the new regulations.\n",
    "European and National Jurisdiction Considerations:\n",
    "•\tThe EU sets overarching regulatory frameworks and standards, but implementation of specific tax incentives remains under the jurisdiction of individual member states.\n",
    "•\tThe EU cannot mandate specific environmental projects or local economic activities; it only provides a framework and standards for what qualifies as a green bond eligible project.\n",

    "corpus2 = [\"\"\"Summary of the Legislation:\n",
    "Title: \"European Green Bond Framework Act\"\n",
    "Background: Green bonds are a growing financial tool used to fund projects that have positive environmental impacts, such as renewable energy, clean transport, and pollution control. The push for such legislation reflects a growing recognition of the urgent need to finance projects that support the EU's climate change objectives and transition to a green economy.\n",
    "Aims: The legislation is designed to support sustainable economic activities through the development and promotion of green bonds, ensuring that investments align with broader environmental goals. It aims to mobilize private and public capital for projects that mitigate the effects of climate change and promote ecological sustainability.\n",
    "Scope and Addressees: This law targets financial institutions, corporate and public sector bond issuers, and investors interested in funding environmentally beneficial projects. It outlines responsibilities and guidelines for these entities to foster a robust market for green bonds within the EU.\n",
    "Key Provisions:\n",
    "1.\tCriteria for Green Bonds: Define what qualifies as a green bond, including the environmental standards projects must meet to be eligible for funding through such bonds.\n",
    "2.\tDisclosure Requirements: Mandate that issuers provide detailed, transparent information regarding the use of proceeds, expected environmental benefits, and measures in place to ensure accountability.\n",
    "3.\tRegulatory Oversight: Establish guidelines for regulatory bodies to supervise and verify the adherence to green bond principles, safeguarding against greenwashing.\n",
    "4.\tSupport Mechanisms: Introduce incentives, possibly including tax benefits or subsidies, for projects financed by green bonds to enhance their attractiveness to investors.\n",
    "5.\tIntegration with International Standards: Ensure that the EU green bond standards are harmonious with global practices to attract international investors and facilitate cross-border investments.\n",
    "Entry into Force: The legislation would typically be scheduled to take effect one to two years after passage to allow adequate time for adaptation by market participants. If approved in 2024, it could be expected to become operative by 2025 or 2026.\n",
    "The support from left-wing groups, social democrats, some non-attached members, and the Greens indicates a strong environmental and social agenda driving the legislation. Opposition from more conservative and right-wing factions may stem from concerns about the financial impact on businesses and the broader economy. Nonetheless, the passage of this act by the supporting parties suggests a significant commitment to leveraging financial markets for environmental sustainability.\"\"\", \n",
    "\"\"\"Summary of the Legislation:\n",
    "Title: \"European Green Bond Enhancement Act\"\n",
    "Background: Green bonds are specialized financial instruments designed to raise funds for projects that benefit the environment, such as clean energy, sustainable transportation, and waste management. The legislation is influenced by a desire to integrate financial markets with the EU's environmental goals, particularly in light of increasing pressures to address climate change effectively.\n",
    "Aims: The primary aim of this legislation is to foster the growth of the green bond market, encouraging the financing of environmentally friendly projects while maintaining a favorable economic climate for investors and issuers. This reflects a balance between environmental concerns and economic growth, appealing to the more conservative and right-leaning parties' focus on market-friendly policies.\n",
    "Scope and Addressees: The law is directed at financial institutions, corporations issuing bonds, and government entities, as well as investors interested in green finance. It provides a framework for the issuance and management of green bonds, ensuring that these bonds are attractive investment opportunities that also contribute to environmental sustainability.\n",
    "Key Provisions:\n",
    "1.\tClear Definition of Green Bonds: Set forth detailed criteria for what projects can be financed by green bonds, focusing on their capacity to generate economic returns alongside environmental benefits.\n",
    "2.\tTransparency and Disclosure: Require issuers to provide comprehensive information on how the funds will be used, the expected environmental impacts, and regular performance updates.\n",
    "3.\tRegulatory Framework: Outline the responsibilities of financial regulators to monitor the market, ensuring that green bonds fulfill their intended purpose and that issuers meet strict compliance guidelines.\n",
    "4.\tMarket Incentives: Introduce incentives such as lower tax rates or reduced regulatory requirements for eligible projects, aimed at boosting investment in green bonds.\n",
    "5.\tAlignment with International Standards: Ensure that EU regulations align with international green bond principles to attract global investors and facilitate the integration of the European market with international financial markets.\n",
    "Entry into Force: The law would typically be enacted within one year of its passage, allowing for a period of adjustment for market participants. If passed in 2024, it might be expected to come into effect by 2025.\n",
    "The legislation, supported by parties typically aligned with more conservative economic policies, likely emphasizes market efficiency and economic incentives over more stringent environmental criteria, which might be why left-leaning parties, social democrats, and the Greens opposed it. This alignment underscores a practical approach to environmental finance, balancing the need for sustainability with economic viability and appeal to conservative investors and businesses.\n",
