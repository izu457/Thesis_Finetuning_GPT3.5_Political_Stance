PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: transport is the only sector where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been on the rise. The GHG emissions from road transport are no exception. They represent almost 20% of total EU GHG emissions and have significantly increased since 1990. Air quality continues to be impacted by traffic and congestion, leading to increasing number of cities introducing low and zero-emission zones restricting local access for vehicles with internal combustion engines and to certain Member States announcing the phase-out of sales of internal combustion engine cars. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution, including road transport. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU to achieve the updated target for 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 by setting strengthened CO2 emission performance standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The proposal should ensure that CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles are reduced, provide benefits to consumers in term of air quality and energy savings, and strengthen the technological leadership of the EU automotive value chain. Additional co-benefits are expected to be increased energy efficiency and energy security. A combination of measures is required to tackle rising emissions in road transport to complement emissions trading. Stronger CO2 emissions standards for cars and vans will accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility. Under the proposal, average emissions of new cars should be reduced by 55% from 2030 and 100% from 2035 compared to 2021 levels. For new vans, the net reduction targets would be 50% and 100% respectively. To ensure that drivers are able to charge or fuel their vehicles at a reliable network across Europe, the revised Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation will require Member States to expand charging capacity in line with zero-emission car sales, and to install charging and fuelling points at regular intervals on major highways: every 60 kilometres for electric charging and every 150 kilometres for hydrogen refuelling. In addition, the proposal: - introduces derogations for certain manufacturers responsible for between 1 000 and 10 000 new passenger cars or between 1 000 and 22 000 new light commercial vehicles in a calendar year to apply for a derogation from the specific emission targets is removed from 2030 onwards. Manufacturers responsible for less than 1 000 new vehicle registrations per calendar year continue to be exempt; - sets out the obligation for the Commission to report on the progress towards zero-emission road mobility and assess the need for possible additional measures to facilitate the transition; - amends the Annexes with a view to: (i) adjusting the formulae for calculating the EU fleet-wide targets for 2030 and setting the formulae for 2035 as well as the annual specific emission targets for each manufacturer and removing the application of the zero- and low-emission vehicle (ZLEV) factor from 2030 onwards and; (ii) adjusting the formulae for determining the slope values required for calculating the annual specific emission targets. This adjustment is made in order to ensure a fair distribution of the reduction burden between manufacturers of lighter light commercial vehicles and those manufacturing heavier vehicles of that category.",EP9

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the report on the ‘European Environment - State and Outlook 2020’, presented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on 4 December 2019, identified the unprecedented scale and urgency of the environmental, climate and sustainability challenges facing Europe today. These challenges require immediate and concerted action and urgent systemic solutions. The European Commission has responded to these challenges by adopting the ‘European Green Deal’, which aims to make the EU the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Following the debate on the communication ‘A clean planet for all’, in March 2020 the EU presented its long-term strategy under the Paris agreement on climate change, committing the EU to becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050. The Commission has proposed enshrining this target in EU climate law. In response to the coronavirus crisis, the ‘Next Generation EU recovery plan’ proposed by the European Commission on 27 May 2020 and endorsed by the Extraordinary European Council of July 2020 underlines the importance of the European Green Deal. As a follow-up to the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) which shall expire on 31 December 2020, the Commission is presenting a proposal for an 8th EAP, with a long-term vision and priority environmental objectives to support the EU's common commitment to achieve a green recovery. CONTENT: the proposal for a decision establishes a general action programme in the field of the environment for the period up to 31 December 2030 to accelerate the Union's transition towards a climate-neutral, clean, resource-efficient and circular economy in a fair and inclusive manner. The 8th EAP shall support the environment and climate action objectives of the European Green Deal in line with the long-term objective to ‘live well, within the planetary boundaries’ by 2050, which is already established in the 7th EAP. It shall contribute to achieving the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. Priority objectives The proposed 8th EAP sets thematic priority objectives in the areas of climate neutrality, adaptation to climate change, protection and restoration of biodiversity, aiming at zero pollution and reducing the pressures of production and consumption on the environment. It also sets out the conditions for achieving the long-term objectives and priority thematic objectives for all actors involved. Monitoring framework One of the key actions of the 8th EAP, announced by the European Green Deal, is a new monitoring framework to measure the progress made by the EU and its Member States in implementing the programme's priority objectives. The 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide the environment and climate input to the EU’s overall efforts to measure progress towards sustainability and shall inform policy makers and stakeholders if the Union and the Member States are on track to achieving a systemic transformation. The process to develop an 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide an opportunity to explore the potential of the ongoing workstream on the planetary boundaries (e.g. freshwater use, land use change, ocean acidification) and on the Union consumption footprint, including deforestation and forest degradation in third countries. Key indicators The 8th EAP monitoring framework should comprise a limited number of key indicators for high-level communication, which tell a coherent story about the state of the environment, the main pressures and the effectiveness of our response. On the basis of a consultation process with the other EU institutions, Member States and stakeholders, the Commission intends to present a set of key indicators for the 8th EAP by the end of 2021. Budgetary implications This proposal has been developed in line with the Commission proposal for the EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. It introduces the need for additional resources in the European Environment Agency (EEA) and in the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in supporting the new monitoring, measuring and reporting framework of this Programme. The estimated impact on operational expenditure for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 23.379 million for the EEA and EUR 2.369 million for ECHA. It is expected that Heading 3 of the MFF ‘Natural Resources and Environment’ shall maintain neutrality and shall not be impacted by this proposal. The resources needed for the EEA and ECHA shall be deducted from the LIFE budget according to a split of 2/3 of the costs for DG Environment and 1/3 of the costs of DG Climate Action for the EEA, while the resources needed for ECHA shall be fully covered by DG Environment.",EP9

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the consequences of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for farmers and rural businesses are unprecedented. Mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments have led to economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances. CONTENT: the proposal includes limited and targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 providing exceptional and temporary support to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, which are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Exceptional temporary support Support under this measure shall consist of temporary emergency aid to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis to ensure the continuity of their activities. It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years.",EP9

12487,"""""Strengthening the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women""""",0.016,0.385,0.932,0.315,0.263,0.657,0.805,0.732,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish minimum requirements to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women through pay transparency and enforcement mechanism. PURPOSE: to set up a European Partnership on Metrology jointly undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 2 and 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union enshrine the right to equality between women and men as one of the core values and tasks of the Union. The European pillar of social rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, includes among its principles equal treatment of women and men and the right to equal pay for work of equal value. Despite Directive 2006/54/EC, supplemented in 2014 by a Commission Recommendation on pay transparency, the effective implementation of the principle of equal pay remains problematic in practice in the EU. The gender pay gap in the EU remains at around 14%. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences on female workers make it even more urgent to address this issue. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for more action at EU level to improve the implementation of equal pay provisions. The Council has called on both the Member States and the Commission to act. Following the evaluation of the existing framework on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, the gender equality strategy 2020-2025 announced binding measures on pay transparency. CONTENT: the proposed directive aims to address the persistent inadequacy in the application of the fundamental right to equal pay and to ensure that this right is respected throughout the EU, by setting standards for pay transparency to enable workers to assert their right to equal pay. Member States could provide for a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive. Same work and work of equal value The proposal requires Member States to establish tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of work in line with a set of objective criteria which include educational, professional and training requirements, skills, effort and responsibility, work undertaken and the nature of the tasks involved. The availability of clear criteria at national level will help workers to establish a valid comparator and assess whether they are treated less favourably than the comparator performing the same work or work of equal value. Pay transparency The proposal: - requires employers to provide, prior to the job interview, information on the initial pay level or a corresponding range (based on objective and gender-neutral criteria) to be paid to the future worker in relation to a specific position or job. Employers would not have the right to ask applicants about their pay history in their former employment relationship; - requires employers to make available to workers a description of the gender-neutral criteria used to define their pay and career progression; - gives workers the right to ask their employer for information on their individual pay level and on average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work or work of equal value; - requires employers with at least 250 workers to make publicly accessible certain information, such as the pay gap between female and male workers in their organisation. On the basis of the information provided, employees and their representatives would have the right to ask the employer for clarification of this information; - obliges the employers concerned to carry out a pay assessment in cooperation with employee representatives where the pay information indicates a gender pay gap of at least 5%, which the employer cannot justify on the basis of objective and gender-neutral factors. Better access to justice for victims of pay discrimination With regard to redress and enforcement, the proposal: - requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to enforce the rights and obligations under the Directive; - introduces the right for equality bodies and workers’ representatives or other legal entities to act on behalf or in support of a worker, and for them to bring collective claims to court; - obliges Member States to ensure that any worker who is a victim of sex discrimination in pay can obtain full compensation for the harm caused; - increases the burden of proof on the employer: the employer, not the worker, should prove the absence of discrimination in relation to pay; - provides that the limitation period for bringing a claim under the proposed Directive should be at least three years; - requires Member States to establish specific penalties for infringements of the equal pay rule, including minimum fines.",EP9

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaries of a Channel fixed link, signed in Canterbury on 12 February 1986, established an intergovernmental committee to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transition period set out in the withdrawal agreement, unless otherwise provided, EU law will no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and, as regards the part of the Channel Fixed Link under French jurisdiction, the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be a national safety authority under Union law. The safety authorisations for the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager and safety certificates for railway undertakings operating through the Fixed Link issued by the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be valid. By Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council, France was empowered to negotiate, sign and conclude an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety and interoperability rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link, with the aim of maintaining a unified safety regime. However, it is unlikely that such agreement will enter into force by the end of the transition period. In the light of the economic importance of the Channel Fixed Link to the EU, it is essential that the Channel Fixed Link continue to operate after 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in view of the end of the transitional period referred to in the withdrawal agreement, the proposed Regulation lays down transitional provisions for certain safety certificates and safety approvals issued under Directive 2004/49/EC and for certain licences of railway undertakings issued under Directive 2012/34/EU. In concrete terms, the proposal: - extends the validity of safety authorisations of the infrastructure manager by two months and the validity of safety certificates and licences of railway undertakings by nine months; - also extends by nine months the validity of the operating licences issued by the United Kingdom under Directive 2012/34/EU in order to allow railway undertakings to continue to operate up to the Calais-Fréthun border-crossing station and thus ensure connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom; - provides that such authorisations, certificates and licences are subject to Directive (EU) 2016/798 and Directive 2012/34/EU respectively and requires their holders of to cooperate with the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority and provide the necessary information; the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority must monitor that the holders of these authorisations, certificates and licences comply with EU law; - confers implementing powers on the Commission to withdraw the benefit conferred on the holders of the approvals/certificates and licences in question, where compliance with EU requirements is not ensured.",EP9

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Special Partnership between the EU and Cabo Verde was approved by the Council of the European Union on 19 November 2007. One of its objectives is to increase mobility and people-to-people contacts between citizens of the Union and Cabo Verde, as well as to strengthen cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration. On 1 December 2014, the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union entered into force. After almost 5 years of implementation of these Agreements and in light of the supervened changes of both the EU and Cabo Verde’s domestic legislation related to visas, namely the revision of the EU’s Visa Code 3 and Cabo Verde decision to exempt EU citizens from the visa requirement for stays up to 30 days, the Joint Committee set up by the existing agreement explored the need to amend certain rules thereby established, with a view to adapt it to the changed circumstances. On that basis, the Commission presented on 13 September 2019, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate an Agreement amending the existing Visa Facilitation Agreement with the Republic of Cabo Verde. The Council having given its authorisation, the chief negotiators reached an agreement in principle on the draft text of the agreement, initialled on 24 July 2020 through an exchange of e-mails. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cabo Verde amending the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas to the citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union. The purpose of the agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issuance of visas for an intended stay of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement provides for the following: - the reduction of the visa fee for processing applications to 75% of the amount to be charged in accordance with the applicable domestic (i.e. EUR 60 for Cabo Verdean citizens); for children of at least 12 years of age (but under 18 years of age), the fee is further reduced by 50% compared to the generally applicable amount (i.e. EUR 30 for Cabo Verdean citizens); - simplification of the documents required to justify the purpose of the journey for certain categories of applicants, e.g. business people; spouses, children and parents of Union citizens or Cabo Verdean citizens legally residing in the EU; schoolchildren, students; participants in scientific, cultural, sporting or religious events, journalists and persons travelling for medical reasons; - the modification of the rules on the issuing of multiple-entry visas focusing on the previous lawful use of the visa during a given reference period rather than on the purpose of travel of the applicants; - the exemption from the visa requirement for short stays for holders of a valid EU laissez-passer; - the possibility for the parties to suspend the agreement in whole or in part for any reason deemed appropriate; - the amendment of the general clause of the agreement to ensure that: (i) the facilitation granted to Cabo Verdean citizens would be granted to EU citizens if the visa requirement for stays of up to 30 days re-imposed for their visit to Cabo Verde; (ii) at least the same facilitation are granted to EU citizens applying for a Cabo Verde visa for stays exceeding 30 days but not exceeding 90 days; - the amendment of the Joint Declaration on cooperation on travel documents to include a reference to Cabo Verde’s internal legislation introducing biometric travel documents.",EP9

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/615/JHA) and the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/616/JHA) are intended to improve the exchange of information between the services responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences and to strengthen cross-border police and judicial cooperation between the Member States of the Union. The Prüm Decision contains, inter alia, provisions whereby Member States grant one another, on a mutual basis, access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities (’the Forensic Decision’) lays down the requirements for the exchange of DNA and fingerprint data, in order to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within any other Member State.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Erasmus programme already enables millions of young Europeans to study, train or learn abroad while broadening their experience and awareness of Europe, and increasing their future chances on the labour market. It is one of the Union's most visible achievements. In its Communication adopted on 2 May 2018, the Commission proposed to put more emphasis on youth in the context of the next multiannual financial framework, notably by doubling the size of the Erasmus+ programme 2014-2020. The resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 14 September 2017 stressed that the future programme should aim to be accessible to all young people and that these higher ambitions should be reflected in an increase in the budget for the next programming period. In a context of rapid and profound changes induced by technological revolution and globalisation, the Commission considers it essential to invest in learning mobility and exchanges within the framework of a significantly reinforced, inclusive and extended programme. The ambition for the next programme goes hand in hand with the Commission's vision to work towards a European Education Area by 2025 empowering young people and promoting a European identity through youth, education and culture policies. The programme is one of the funding instruments under the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework aiming at investing in people, social cohesion and values. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Erasmus programme for education, training, youth and sport for the period 2021-2027 which will succeed the Erasmus+ 2014-2020 programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The programme aims to support learning mobility opportunities that contribute to the personal, educational, civic and professional development of individuals. It shall also support cooperation between stakeholders at organisational and policy level with a view to foster inclusion, excellence, creativity and innovation in education, training, youth and sport. Objectives : in particular, the proposed new programme shall: be accessible to a larger number of people : the programme shall support all categories of learners, whether they are in higher education, general education, vocational education or training, adult education, non-formal learning, youth and active participation activities. The goal is to triple the number of participants; a broader focus on people from all social backgrounds : the programme shall further facilitate the participation of people with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as EU citizens living in remote areas. Mobility opportunities for students, people in vocational training, apprentices and young people should be extended; help Europeans to acquire new skills : the programme shall support activities to equip citizens with the necessary knowledge, skills and competences, including language skills, in a lifelong learning perspective. It shall pay greater attention to digital skills and future-oriented areas such as climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analysis, arts/design, etc. address a wider target group both within and beyond the EU : mobility and cooperation with third countries shall be enhanced through a combination of physical and virtual mobility and the use of more flexible learning mobility formats to meet the needs of certain target groups, such as adult learners. The programme shall also facilitate the participation of small scale and grassroots organisations; promote a European identity : the programme shall encourage youth participation in Europe’s democratic life by raising awareness about common European values, including fundamental rights, bringing together young people and decision-makers at local, national and EU level and contribute to the European integration process. A new initiative called DiscoverEU shall give young people the opportunity to discover other EU countries. The programme would also contribute to promoting common European values through sport, good governance and integrity in sport; strengthen the Union's relations with the rest of the world : intensify international mobility and cooperation with third countries - in particular enlargement, neighbourhood, industrialised and emerging countries - in order to support institutions and organisations in Europe in facing the challenges of globalisation. Key actions : the proposal defines specific objectives for each of the three action areas of the programme (education and training, youth and sport). Each of these three areas would be structured around three key actions: ‘learning mobility’ (key action 1); ‘cooperation among organisations and institutions’ (key action 2) and ‘support to policy development and cooperation’ (key action 3). In order to simplify requirements for beneficiaries, it is proposed to use simplified grants in the form of lump-sums, unit-costs and flat-rate funding should be used to the maximum possible extent. The future Erasmus monitoring and evaluation framework shall follow an approach based on continuous monitoring to assess the progress towards achieving the output and results targets of the programme. Proposed budget : EUR 30 billion for the period 2021-2027, according to the following indicative breakdown: EUR 24.94 billion for actions in the field of education and training; EUR 3.10 billion for actions in the youth field; EUR 550 million for actions in the field of sport; and at least EUR 960 million as a contribution to the operating costs of the national agencies.",EP8

2013,"""""Transparency of securities financing transactions""""",0.8,0.86,0.88,0.562,0.173,0.851,0.853,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve transparency in securities financing transactions (SFT) and therefore in the financial system. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2008 global financial crisis revealed important regulatory gaps in the financial system. It also highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where non-bank credit activities took place, called “shadow banking”. Confronted with new legislative developments in the banking sector, including structural measures, it is possible that banks will shift parts of their activity into less regulated areas as shadow banking. At the end of 2012 global shadow banking assets accounted for EUR 53 trillion, representing about half the size of the regulated banking system and mainly concentrated in Europe (around EUR 23 trillion) and in the United States (around EUR 19.3 trillion). On 19 March 2012, the Commission published a Green Paper on shadow banking, and on 4 September 2013, it published a Communication on the subject. It stressed that the complex and opaque nature of securities financing transactions (SFTs) makes it difficult to identify counterparties and monitor risk concentration. This also leads to the built-up of excessive leverage in the financial system. A High-Level Expert Group chaired by Erkki Liikanen adopted a report on reforming the structure of the Union banking sector in October 2012. The report recognised the risks of shadow banking activities such as high leverage and pro- cyclicality, and it called for a reduction of the interconnectedness between banks and the shadow banking system, which had been a source of contagion in a system-wide banking crisis. Actions regarding these matters have been international and coordinated through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) which, in August 2013, adopted a policy framework consisting of eleven Recommendations addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos. These Recommendations were subsequently endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders. In order to closely follow market trends regarding entities whose activities qualify as shadow banking, in particular in the area of securities financing transactions, the Commission feels it necessary to implement transparency requirements. The proposal regarding structural reforms of the EU banking sector, which is presented in a package with this proposal, is the final piece of the new regulatory framework, ensuring that even the largest banks in the EU become less complex and can be effectively resolved, with minimum implications for tax payers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that a combination of different measures is necessary including reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, disclosure on the use of SFTs to fund investors, and the need for prior consent to rehypothecation of the financial instruments. The latter must be transferred to an account opened in the name of the receiving counterparty before rehypothecation can take place. This will ensure that the shadow banking activity of using SFTs is properly supervised and regulated. The use of SFTs as such will not be prohibited nor limited by specific restrictions but be more transparent. CONTENT: the Regulation aims at enhancing financial stability in the EU by means of increasing transparency of certain market activities, such as SFTs, rehypothecation and other financing structures having equivalent economic effect as SFTs. The Regulation introduces measures to improve the transparency in three main areas: (1) the monitoring of the build-up of systemic risks related to SFT transactions in the financial system; (2) the disclosure of the information on such transactions to the investors whose assets are employed in these or equivalent transactions; and (3) the contractual transparency of rehypothecation activities. In practice, the proposed measures will cover the FSB recommendations, these being: The obligation for competent authorities to collect additional data on the use of SFTs: the draft Regulation creates a Union framework under which financial or non-financial counterparties of a SFT will efficiently report the details of the transaction to trade repositories. This information will be centrally stored and easily and directly accessible to the relevant authorities, such as ESMA, ESRB, the ESCB, for the purpose of identification and monitoring of financial stability risks entailed by shadow banking activities of regulated and non-regulated entities. The requirement that requires fund managers be transparent towards their investors: in order to enable investors to become aware of the risks associated with the use of SFTs and other financing structures, fund managers should include detailed information on any recourse they have to these techniques in regular reporting intervals. The existing periodical reports that UCITS management or investment companies and AIF managers have to produce will be supplemented by this additional information on the use of SFTs and other financing structures. The requirement for financial intermediaries to provide sufficient disclosure to their clients in relation to re-hypothecation of assets : any rehypothecation should therefore take place only with the express knowledge of inherent risks and prior consent of the providing counterparty in a contractual agreement and should be appropriately reflected in the securities accounts. The counterparty receiving financial instruments as collateral will be allowed to rehypothecate them only with the express consent of the providing counterparty and only after having them transferred to its own account. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal involves the hiring of two new temporary agents at EBA from January 2016. The new tasks will be carried out with the human resources available within the annual budgetary allocation procedure, and in line with the financial programming for agencies. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.",EP8


9421,"""""European Solidarity Corps programme """"",0.314,0.851,1.0,0.271,0.077,0.91,0.89,0.096,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish the European solidarity corps for the period 2021-2027. BACKGROUND: the European Union is built on solidarity, a shared value which is strongly felt throughout European society. There are many young people who want to engage in solidarity activities, and there are many unmet needs in communities that could be addressed by involving young people in such activities. The State of the Union address of 14 September 2016 emphasised the need to invest in young people and announced the establishment of a European Solidarity Corps with a view to creating opportunities for young people across the Union to make a meaningful contribution to society, show solidarity and develop their skills. In its communication of 7 December 2016, the Commission launched the first phase of the Corps and reiterated the target of having 100 000 young Europeans taking part in it by 2020. During this initial phase, eight different EU programmes were mobilised to offer volunteering, traineeship or job opportunities to young people across the EU. As there is potential to further develop solidarity with victims of crises and disasters in non-EU countries, this proposal provides for extending the scope of the European Solidarity Corps to include support to humanitarian aid operations in non-EU countries, including those located in the EU outermost regions' neighbourhood. The new programme shall allow at least 350 000 young Europeans to support communities in need between 2021 and 2027 through volunteering, traineeships and job placements. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European solidarity corps under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. The regulation on the European solidarity corps shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2021. The European solidarity corps aims to strengthen the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high-quality solidarity activities. It is a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity and democracy in Europe and abroad and to address societal and humanitarian challenges on the ground, with a particular focus on promoting social inclusion. It shall enable participants to strengthen and validate their skills and facilitate their integration into the labour market. The programme shall offer activities that can be undertaken in a country other than the country of residence of the participants (cross-border activities and volunteering in support of humanitarian aid) and activities that can be undertaken in their country of residence (in-country). The programme shall be implemented under two strands of action: Strand 1: participation of young people in solidarity activities addressing societal challenges : the actions shall contribute in particular to strengthening cohesion, solidarity and democracy in the EU and beyond, while addressing societal challenges, with particular efforts to promote social inclusion; Strand 2: participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities (European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps) : these actions shall contribute in particular to providing needs-based humanitarian aid, aimed at preserving lives, preventing and alleviating human suffering and maintaining human dignity, as well as strengthening the capacities and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-stricken communities. Supported actions : the European solidarity corps shall provide young people with easily accessible opportunities to engage in volunteering, traineeships or jobs in solidarity-related sectors, such as the social economy, and to devise and develop solidarity projects at their own initiative. It shall also support networking activities for its participants and organisations. Participation : the European solidarity corps targets young people aged 18-30, and participation in the activities offered by the European solidarity corps shall require prior registration in the European solidarity corps portal. Any public or private entity established in a participating country as well as international organisations may apply for funding under the European solidarity corps. A quality label shall be obtained by the participating organisation as a pre-condition for receiving funding under the European solidarity corps. Special attention shall be given to ensuring that the activities supported by the European solidarity corps are accessible to all young people, notably the most disadvantaged ones. Special measures shall be put in place to promote social inclusion, the participation of disadvantaged young people, as well as to take into account the constraints imposed by the remoteness of a number of rural areas and of the outermost regions of the Union and the Overseas Countries and Territories. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission’s proposal for the multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 1.26 billion at current prices for the period 2021-2027.",EP8


4366,"""""Emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants""""",0.629,0.937,0.0,0.146,0.192,0.866,0.895,0.038,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to reduce national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants with a view to addressing the highly significant remaining health risks and environmental impacts posed by air pollution in the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress has been achieved in the past 20 years in the Union in the field of anthropogenic air emissions and air quality by a dedicated Union policy, including the 2005 Communication from the Commission ""Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution”. Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has been instrumental in this progress by setting caps on Member States' total annual emissions for 2010 onwards of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC). As a result, SO2 emissions were reduced by 82%, NOx emissions by 47%, NMVOC emissions by 56% and NH3 emissions by 28% between 1990 and 2010. However, as indicated in the ""Clean Air Programme for Europe"" (""revised TSAP""), significant adverse impacts and risks remain on the environment and human health. There is a need to review and update these requirements to address the highly significant remaining health risks and environmental impacts posed by air pollution in the Union, and to align Union law with new international commitments following a revision of the Gothenburg Protocol in 2012. The revised TSAP sets out new strategic objectives for the period up to 2030 with a view to moving further towards the Union's long-term objective. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment modelled the optimal delivery of the desired reduction, and this optimisation yielded national emission reduction commitments for the six most relevant pollutants. These reduction commitments will reduce total external costs of air pollution by EUR 40 billion (on the most conservative valuation) compared to the EUR 212 billion in the baseline, including direct economic benefits amounting to more than EUR 2.8 billion. The baseline shall deliver in 2030 a reduction of health burden by 40% as compared to 2005. This proposal delivers an extra 12%, which makes a 52% reduction in total regarding health burden as compared to 2005. For eutrophication, it delivers an extra 50% on top of the baseline. CONTENT: the proposal repeals and replaces the current Union regime on the annual capping of national emissions of air pollutants, as defined in Directive 2001/81/EC. By doing so: it ensures that the national emission ceilings (NECs) set in Directive 2001/81/EC for 2010 onwards for SO2, NOx, NMVOC and NH3 shall apply until 2020; establishes new national emission reduction commitments (""reduction commitments"") applicable from 2020 and 2030 for SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, fine particulate matter (PM2,5) and methane (CH4) as well as intermediate emission levels for the year 2025 applicable to the same pollutants. National reduction commitments : the proposal provides that the Member States must limit their annual emissions of SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, PM2,5 and CH4, to meet their reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, Member States must limit in 2025 their annual emissions of those pollutants to the levels defined on the basis of a linear reduction trajectory, unless this would require measures entailing disproportionate costs. The proposal also indicates what emission sources should not be accounted for. Flexibilities : the proposal entitles Member States to use certain flexibilities, provided that the Commission does not object: to account for a share of NOx, SO2, and PM2,5 emission reductions achieved by international maritime traffic under certain conditions; to implement jointly their reduction commitments for CH4; and to propose adjusted emission inventories when non-compliance with a reduction commitment (save for CH4) results from improved inventory methodology. In addition, the proposal: requires the Member States to adopt, implement and regularly update their national air pollution control programmes (NAPCPs) describing how their reduction commitments shall be met; requires Member States to monitor air pollutant emissions and, in so doing, prepare and update national emission inventories and projections to be accompanied by an informative inventory report (IIR); states that Member States shall monitor, where practicable, the adverse impacts of air pollution upon water and terrestrial ecosystems; requires Member States to communicate to the Commission, at the dates specified, their NAPCP and any updates and all monitoring information; the Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency and Member States, shall regularly verify the accuracy and completeness of reported national emission inventory data; seeks to promote cooperation between the Commission and Member States with third countries and relevant international organisations to further and better address air pollutant emissions at a global level; lays down the provisions on penalties applicable to breaches of the national provisions enacted pursuant to the proposal, on the entry into force and the transposition of the proposal into Member States’ legislation; provides that the Commission shall report every five years on the implementation of this Directive. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.",EP8


8681,"""""Establishing the space programme of the Union and the European Union Agency for the Space Programme""""",0.486,0.769,0.76,0.521,0.096,0.806,0.77,0.192,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027 and the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. Space supports many policies and strategic priorities of the Union. It can play a crucial role in effectively tackling new challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, border control, maritime surveillance and security of Union citizens. The Union’s space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. It is therefore crucial that the Union remains a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, that it encourages scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission stressed in the space strategy for Europe, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of the services offered by Galileo and EGNOS (the global and regional satellite navigation systems) and Copernicus (Union Earth observation and monitoring programme) and of preparing new generations of these services, enhancing the space surveillance and tracking (SST) services and announced the governmental satellite communications initiative ‘GOVSATCOM’. The Commission's approach was advocated both by the Council in its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2017 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 12 September 2017. The development and implementation of a space programme is beyond the financial and technical capabilities of a single Member State and can only be achieved at EU level. By providing a coherent framework for future investment, a fully integrated space programme shall bring together all the Union's activities in this highly strategic field. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027. It aims to consolidate all existing and new space activities in a single programme. The general objectives of the proposed new programme are as follows: provide high-quality, up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space data, information and services, where possible on a global scale, meeting existing and future needs and able to meet the Union's political priorities, including climate change and security and defence; maximise socio-economic benefits, including by promoting the widest possible use of data, information and services provided by programme components; strengthen the security of the Union and its Member States, its freedom of action and its strategic autonomy; promote the Union’s role on the international stage as a leading actor in the space sector. The programme shall have the following specific objectives: Galileo and EGNOS : to provide of state-of-the-art and, where appropriate, secure positioning, navigation and timing services. The programme shall continue to invest in operations and infrastructure to complement and maintain the satellite constellation, improve signal precision to provide positioning information for autonomous and connected vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors, and encourage the market introduction of satellite navigation services; Copernicus : to deliver accurate and reliable Earth Observation data and information, supplied on a long-term basis, to support the implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States' policies in the fields of the environment, climate change, agriculture and rural development, civil protection, safety and security, as well as the digital economy; Space Situational Awareness (SSA) : to enhance SST capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects which helps avoid collisions in space and monitors the re-entry of space objects to Earth, to monitor space weather and to map and network Member States near Earth object capacities; GOVSATCOM : to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services, to enhance the operational effectiveness of security actors and safeguard citizens' rights to security, to diplomatic or consular protection, and to protection of personal data. The programme shall also: (i) contribute, where this is required for the needs of the Programme, to an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space; (ii) support and reinforce the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity to innovate of legal and natural persons from the Union active or wishing to become active in that sector, with particular regard to the position and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Governance : the proposal clarifies the relations between the various players involved and the role of these players, mainly the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Agency for Space, and by establishing a unified system of governance for all the components of this programme. It enhances the role of the former European GNSS Agency by expanding the scope of its tasks as regards security accreditation to include all the components of the Programme, thus justifying a change of name for this agency, which is to become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. Lastly, it specifies and standardises the security framework for the Programme, particularly as regards the principles to be respected, procedures to be followed and measures to be taken, which is of crucial importance, given the dual use nature of the actions. The programme shares similar objectives with other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe, InvestEU Fund, European Defence Fund and Funds under Regulation (EU) on the common provisions Regulation. Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be foreseen. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 16 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, with the following indicative breakdown: for Galileo and EGNOS : EUR 9.7 billion; for Copernicus : EUR 5.8 billion; for SSA/Govsatcom : EUR 0.5 billion.",EP8

Recalling that the EU and Japan have been strategic partners since 2003, Members welcomed the conclusion of the draft Strategic Partnership Agreement, which provides a binding legal framework, strengthens EU-Japan bilateral relations and cooperation in more than 40 areas, as well as to address global issues requiring global cooperation such as climate change, migration, cyber threats, public health, transnational crime, peacebuilding operations, crisis and disaster management and the fight against terrorism. Parliament welcomed the reference to a parliamentary dimension in the agreement, which aims to strengthen the partnership through dialogue and cooperation on political issues, foreign and security policy and other types of sectoral cooperation. Human rights and fundamental freedoms Members reaffirmed the shared commitment to respect for human rights, democracy, fundamental freedoms, good governance and the rule of law, and common values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They called on the Union to enter into a dialogue with the Japanese government with a view to a moratorium on capital punishment and its possible abolition. They also highlighted the need for increased cooperation on women's rights. International and regional relations While welcoming the EU’s new strategy to improve connectivity with Asia, Parliament called for, inter alia: - the expansion of EU-Japan bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation with South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States and China with a view to achieving and maintaining peace and stability in the region, peaceful coexistence on the Korean peninsula and the full, irreversible and verifiable denuclearisation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; - the development of synergies between Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and EU initiatives, including the EU Investment Plan and the extended EU Trans-European Transport Networks, in order to promote global cooperation in connectivity; - the strengthening of educational and cultural dialogue, university mobility programmes under Erasmus+, and public diplomacy with a view to promoting mutual understanding and cultural diversity; - intensifying cooperation in the field of sustainable energy, for example by developing low-emission forms of transport; - the suspension of whaling for scientific purposes and the lifting of Japan's reservations to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); - further exchange of good practices regarding illegal logging; - the exchange of information and cooperation to end cosmetics testing on animals in Japan. Sectoral cooperation Taking noted of the current low levels of people-to-people exchanges and of the linguistic barriers, Parliament suggested further investment to enhance citizen-to-citizen interaction, educational and cultural dialogue, academic mobility programmes under Erasmus+, and public diplomacy to promote mutual understanding and cultural diversity. It also called for: - Japan’s ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, and intensified cooperation in the field of sustainable energy, e.g. in developing low-emission forms of transport; - the suspension of whaling for scientific purposes and the lifting of Japan's reservations to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); - further exchange of good practices regarding illegal logging; - the exchange of information and cooperation to end cosmetics testing on animals in Japan.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Medicines Agency has been established by Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, which has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In accordance with the Decision of 29 October 1993 taken by common agreement between the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting at Head of State and Government level, on the location of the seats of certain bodies and departments of the European Communities and of Europol, the European Medicines Agency has its seat in London, United Kingdom. Following the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to leave the Union, the 27 remaining Member States, in the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50), selected Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as the new seat for the European Medicines Agency. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 in order to confirm the new seat of the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Agency should occupy its new seat from the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom or from 30 March 2019, whichever is the earlier. It is proposed that the Regulation shall enter into force as a matter of urgency in order to give the Agency sufficient time to relocate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the relocation of the Agency will have budgetary implications, in particular in view of the costs related to the early termination of its current rental contract in London as a consequence of the withdrawal, the costs related to the move itself and the costs related to the installation in the new premises in Amsterdam. As set out in the negotiation directives of the Council of 22 May 2017, the United Kingdom should fully cover the specific costs related to the withdrawal process, such as the relocation of the agencies based in the United Kingdom. Some of the relocation costs (e.g. costs related to the move itself) may have to be pre-financed by the EU budget prior to the final financial settlement. If necessary, the Commission will submit the relevant proposals to the European Parliament and the Council in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure for 2019 and, if necessary, for 2018. In addition, the costs related to the installation in the new premises will also be presented in the context of the building procedure set out in Article 203 of the Financial Regulation, which requires prior approval from the European Parliament and the Council before contracts related to building projects are concluded.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the Paris Agreement, the world has committed to move towards a low-carbon economy. Until now, the CO2 emission reduction standards for cars and vans in place in Europe have represented a fundamental tool to push for innovation and investments in low carbon technologies. However, in the absence of tighter standards for the period beyond 2020, the EU risks losing its technological leadership in this area. The current CO2 emission standards for cars and vans until 2020/21 have contributed to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from light duty vehicles. However, with current implemented policies GHG emissions are not expected to sufficiently decrease to reach the 2030 EU target of at least 40% emission reduction compared to 1990. This proposal is part of a broader mobility package which includes measures on the demand and supply of low-emission vehicles using alternative fuels through the proposed amendments to Directive 2009/33/EC on clean vehicles, Directive 92/106/EEC on combined transport and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 on passenger coach services. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options were grouped into five key elements. The preferred options within these groups are as follows: CO2 emission targets : to set new EU fleet-wide CO2 targets equal to a 30% reduction in 2030 compared to the 2021 targets, both for cars and for vans; distribution of effort amongst manufacturers from 2025 onwards ; incentives for low- and zero-emission vehicles (LEV/ZEV) : the use of a crediting system whereby a manufacturer exceeding a certain benchmark level of ZEV/LEV would be rewarded by getting a less strict CO2 target; elements for cost-effective implementation : to maintain the eco-innovation provisions, pooling provisions and derogations; strengthening of the governance : to establish an empowerment for the Commission to allow (i) the collection, publication and monitoring of real world fuel consumption data and creating an obligation to report deviations linked to a correction mechanisms and (ii) to correct reported CO2 emission values in case of deviations detected through improved market surveillance. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to set cost-effective CO2 emission reduction targets for new light-duty vehicles up to 2030 combined with a dedicated incentive mechanism to increase the share of zero/low-emission vehicles. More specifically, it will provide a clear signal and predictability for industry to invest, stimulate employment, foster innovation and competitiveness. In concrete terms, the proposed revision: specifies the EU fleet wide CO2 targets applicable to new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles from 2020, 2025 and 2030. The Regulation shall repeal Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 and shall apply from 2020 in order to ensure a coherent transition to a new target regime starting from 2025. It therefore includes the already established EU fleet wide targets for 2020 of 95g/km (NEDC based) for passenger cars and 147g/km (NEDC based) for light commercial vehicles, as well as new targets for 2025 and 2030. Starting from 2021, the specific emission targets will be based on the new emissions test procedure, the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP); defines the categories of vehicles that fall within the scope of this Regulation by reference to the type approval legislation. It also clarifies that the de minimis exemption applicable to manufacturers responsible for less than 1000 new registrations per year should not apply where a manufacturer eligible for such an exemption nevertheless applies for and is granted a derogation; sets out the general obligation for a manufacturer to ensure that the average CO2 emissions of its fleet of newly registered vehicles in a calendar year do not exceed its annual specific emissions target. Specific targets are laid down in the proposal. From 2025, the specific emissions target for a manufacturer should be calculated taking into account the share of zero- and low-emission vehicles in the manufacturer's fleet; sets out the formula for calculating the financial penalties in case a manufacturer exceeds its target. The excess emission premium from the existing Regulations is maintained, i.e. 95 euro/g CO2/km; maintains the possibility for small volume manufacturers (i.e. those responsible for 1 000 to 10 000 registrations for cars, and 1 000 to 22 000 registrations for vans) to apply for a derogation from their specific emissions targets. provides an empowerment for the Commission to monitor and assess the real world representativeness the WLTP test procedure and to ensure that the public is informed; clarifies the process for adjusting the reference mass value to ensure that the specific emission targets continue to reflect the EU fleet wide target; includes a requirement for the Commission to provide a report in 2024 on the effectiveness of this Regulation, where appropriate accompanied by a proposal. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards the interpretation of the eligibility criteria for derogations, the content of the applications, and the content and assessment of programmes for the reduction of specific emissions of CO2.",EP8

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council has proved successful in regulating the spirit drinks sector. However, in the light of recent experience and technological innovation it is necessary to update the rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks and to review the ways geographical indications for spirit drinks are registered. In order to align the powers conferred upon the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 to Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, further amendments to that Regulation are needed. CONTENT: the aim of this Commission proposal is to replace Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 and bring it into line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). More specifically, the proposal: divides the provisions adopted by the Commission under that Regulation into delegated acts and implementing acts; contains minor technical adjustments of EU legislation on spirit drinks and it replaces the existing procedures for the management of geographical indications in the spirit drinks sector, with new procedures modelled on the more exhaustive and well tested procedures for agricultural products and foodstuffs laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. It has not been proposed to change the existing EU legal framework for spirit drinks enables the free circulation of goods in the single market by setting up product definitions, labelling rules and provisions related to the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks. Therefore, the purpose and scope of the existing regulation will remain unchanged. This Regulation lays down rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, as well as on the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks. It shall also apply to the use of ethyl alcohol or distillates of agricultural origin in the production of alcoholic beverages and to the use of spirit drinks’ names in the presentation and labelling of other foodstuffs. It shall apply to the products placed on the Union market whether produced in the Union or in third countries, as well as to those produced in the Union for export. Given the importance and complexity of the spirit drinks sector, it is appropriate to keep the spirit drinks Regulation for specific measures on the description and presentation of spirit drinks which go beyond the general rules provided in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, while remaining consistent with those general rules. Lastly, some of the elements currently included in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 716/2013 that concern definitions and rules related to compound terms and allusions, are considered essential and have therefore been introduced in the proposal as part of the basic act. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.",EP8

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the 1979 World Trade Organisation (WTO) plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft was adopted as part of the Tokyo Round. It entered into force on 1 January 1980 and it now has 32 signatories. This Agreement eliminates import duties on all aircraft, other than military aircraft, as well as on all other products covered by the agreement, in particular civil aircraft engines and their parts and components, all components and sub-assemblies of civil aircraft, and flight simulators and their parts and components. It contains disciplines on government-directed procurement of civil aircraft and prohibition of inducements to purchase, as well as on government financial support for the civil aircraft sector. The Annex to the Agreement lists the products that shall be accorded duty-free or duty-exempt treatment, if such products are for the use in civil aircraft or ground flying trainers and for incorporation therein, in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance rebuilding, modification or conversion. Products in the Annex of the Agreement are classified according to their respective tariff headings for customs purposes under the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System) developed by the World Customs Organization. Since the adoption of the ATCA, different versions of Harmonized System have been adopted. In November 2001, members adopted a Protocol Amending the Annex to the ATCA, transposing into the Annex the changes introduced in the 1992, 1996 and 2002 versions of the Harmonised System. Another revision of the Harmonized System took place in 2007. On 5 November 2015, after several years of discussions, the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft agreed to open for acceptance the revised Product Coverage of the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft via the Protocol amending the annex to the ATCA. CONTENT: the Commission is presenting the Commission is submitting a proposal to the Council for a decision on the conclusion of the Protocol amending the Product Coverage Annex of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. The protocol covers matters that fall under the common commercial policy and the amendment concerns a technical update of an international agreement without altering its scope or content.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency, the aim of the proposal is to proceed with the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2000 on the European Union trade mark. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. EU trade mark : the draft regulation establishes, at Union level, the modalities and the conditions for the grant of an EU trade mark. An EU trade mark shall have a unitary character. It shall have equal effect throughout the Union. The proposal also sets up a European Union Intellectual Property Office. The rights in an EU trade mark should not be obtained otherwise than by registration, and registration should be refused in particular if the trade mark is not distinctive, if it is unlawful or if it conflicts with earlier rights. An EU trade mark may consist of any signs, in particular words, including personal names, or designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of the packaging of goods, or sounds provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. Rights conferred by an EU trade mark : the proprietor of that EU trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade, in relation to goods or services, any sign where: the sign is identical with the EU trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered; the use of the sign means that there is likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, including the likelihood of association between the sign and the trade mark. The exclusive rights conferred by an EU trade mark should not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use of signs or indications by third parties which are used fairly and thus in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Application: an application for an EU trade mark shall be filed at the Office. It shall contain: a request for the registration of an Î1 EU trade mark ; information identifying the applicant; a list of the goods or services in respect of which the registration is requested; a representation of the mark. The application for an EU trade mark shall be subject to the payment of the application fee. Where an application meets the requirements set out in the Regulation and where no notice of opposition has been given, the trade mark and the particulars shall be recorded in the Register. The registration shall be published, and the Office shall issue a certificate of registration. Duration and renewal : EU trade marks shall be registered for a period of 10 years from the date of filing of the application. Registration may be renewed for further periods of 10 years at the request of the proprietor, provided that the fees have been paid. The request for renewal shall be submitted in the six-month period prior to the expiry of the registration. Surrender, revocation and invalidity : an EU trade mark may be surrendered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered. The rights of the proprietor of the EU trade mark shall be declared to be revoked on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim: if, within a continuous period of five years, the trade mark has not been put to genuine use in the Union ç in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered; if, in consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, the trade mark has become the common name in the trade for a product or service; if, in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor, the trade mark is liable to mislead the public. An EU trade mark shall be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings where there is an earlier trade mark in accordance with EU or national law. The decisions of the Office will be subject to appeal. EU certification marks : the Regulation states that such a mark shall be an EU trade mark which is described as such when the mark is applied for and is capable of distinguishing goods or services which are certified by the proprietor of the mark in respect of material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services, quality, accuracy or other characteristics, with the exception of geographical origin, from goods and services which are not so certified.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 196) was signed by the Union on 22 October 2015, subject to its conclusion. Article 10 of the Protocol provides that the latter is open for the approval of the European Union. The Additional Protocol came into force on 1 July 2017. As of 11 July 2017, three EU Member States have ratified the Additional Protocol, and twenty-four EU Member States have signed it. The terrorist threat has grown and rapidly evolved in recent years. Foreign terrorist fighters have been linked to recent attacks and plots in several Member States. In addition, the Union and its Member States face increased threats from individuals who are inspired or instructed by terrorist groups abroad. In view of the continuing threat of terrorism to fundamental rights and the global nature of terrorism, the European Union must act united to promote and defend the principles of democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The Union has already adopted measures in the area covered by the Additional Protocol, including substantive criminal law provisions as well as a provision on enhanced information exchange. With the adoption of the directive on the fight against terrorism, the European Union is ready to complete its commitment to be a party to the Additional Protocol by conclusion of that instrument. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the decision to conclude the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 217). The present proposal is therefore accompanied by, and must be read together with, a proposal concerning a decision to conclude Convention No. 196 on behalf of the Union. Objectives of the Additional Protocol: the Protocol defines criminal offences related to terrorism, an area for which the Union has jurisdiction under Article 83(1) TFEU. It covers fields to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, namely the setting of minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in the area of terrorism (Article 83(1) TFEU) where consent by the European Parliament is required. The Additional Protocol supplements Convention No. 196 with a series of provisions aimed at implementing the criminal law aspects of UN Security Council Resolution 2178(2014) on “Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts”. It seeks to prevent and curb the flow of foreign terrorist fighters to conflict zones and provide a common understanding of and response to foreign terrorist fighter-related offences, which serves as a benchmark for information exchange and facilitates cross-border investigations and prosecutions of acts of a preparatory nature having the potential and danger of leading to the commission of terrorist offences. The Additional Protocol thus provides for the criminalisation of the following acts: Contact point: the Additional Protocol requires the parties to designate a contact point for the 24/7 exchange of information on foreign terrorist fighters. It is proposed to designate Europol as this contact point, under the conditions stipulated in Regulation (EU) 2016/794 on relations with partners and the transfer and exchange of personal data. Territorial application: the Additional Protocol signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark. It is binding upon and applies in the United Kingdom only insofar as this Member State notifies the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument. Ireland is bound by Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and is therefore to take part in the adoption of this Decision.",EP8

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: under Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/2446, products obtained in Norway, Switzerland or Turkey incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there are to be considered as originating in a beneficiary country, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 45 of that Delegated Regulation (so-called 'cumulation' system). The cumulation system shall apply provided that Norway reciprocally grants the same treatment to products originating in the beneficiary countries which incorporate materials originating in the Union. In the case of Norway, the cumulation system was originally put in place by means of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Norway. That exchange of letters took place on 29 January 2001, following the approval of the Council by Decision 2001/101/EC. In order to ensure the application of a concept of origin corresponding to that set out in the rules of origin in the Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), Norway amended its GSP rules of origin. Therefore, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Norway must be revised. The rules of origin in the GSP were reformed in 2010. They provide for the implementation of a new system for the establishment of proofs of origin by registered exporters, which will apply from 1 January 2017.

The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Vanuatu were opened on 19 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 4 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Vanuatu on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Vanuatu when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Vanuatu to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Vanuatu may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States Scope of the application: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Vanuatu remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Vanuatu reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Vanuatu to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland.

The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 transferred 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19 countries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. Colombia and Peru were, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the Commission could present to the Council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. In October 2014, the Commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of Peru. The Commission concluded that the significant improvement of the Peruvian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that Peruvians should be granted visa-free access to the Member States' territory. In addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the Union. In March 2015, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with Colombia and Peru.

The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 June 2015. The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Peru on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Peru when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Peru may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Peru to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Peru remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Biometric passports: the Agreement includes a number of declarations: Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Peru to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure.",EP8


6861,"""""Financing of European political parties""""",0.877,0.835,0.947,0.387,0.212,0.855,0.841,0.343,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend the Financial Regulation so as to take into account changes proposed by the Commission in its proposal for a Regulation on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations - which will replace current Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 - contains new rules regarding, inter alia, the funding of political parties and political foundations at European level. Their effectiveness requires that they are accompanied by a corresponding set of financial rules anchored in the Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012). The proposal follows the European Parliament resolution of 6 April 2011 regarding the financing of the European political parties which considers that, in light of the experience gained, the financing of European political parties and European political foundations should be improved as regards a number of points. In particular, it calls for an end to the system of grants and the creation of a new financing instrument in the Financial Regulation “devoted solely and tailored specifically to the funding of European Parties and foundations”. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: after a detailed analysis, it is proposed that political parties should indeed be financed through a new instrument (""contributions"") rather than through an operating grant, as it is currently the case. As regards European political foundations, it is considered that they should continue to receive an operating grant. The Commission feels that the request of the European Parliament to exclude European political foundations also from the grant system is not justified given that the specific characteristics of European political parties are not the same as the European political foundations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof. CONTENT: the Commission proposal establishes a new Title VIII be inserted in part Two of the Financial Regulation dedicated to Contributions to European political parties and it repeals the specific provisions regarding European political parties which are currently provided for under Title VI (grants) of part One. The proposal introduces the following elements: Abolition of the ""annual work programme"": in accordance with Parliament’s resolution, the payment of contributions shall not be a precondition for the presentation of an annual work programme and an estimated operating budget. Introduction of eligibility criteria: the authorising officer should request directly from the Registry of European political parties (set up in the EP) certificates confirming that European political parties are duly registered and are in compliance with relevant obligations (e.g. presentation of accounts) and have not been suspended or subject to any administrative penalty as foreseen in the proposal for a Regulation on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations. Abolition of the selection criteria: the selection criteria will not be required in the new Title, since there is little value in verifying the financial and operational capacity of European political parties to represent its citizens, a fortiori when no annual work programme or estimated budget is submitted. Control on their statutory obligations: a provision has been introduced which will explicitly require that European political parties should not be subject to debarment from the Registry or subject to an administrative penalty during the financial year covered by the contribution. In such cases, their contributions would be reduced or terminated and any pre-financing paid recovered. The authorising officer should request such confirmation to the EP Registry before making the payment of the balance. Controls on expenditure and not on actions: while financial support should be awarded without an annual work programme and estimated operating budget, European political parties should justify ex post the sound use of Union funds. In particular, the authorising officer should verify if the EU funds have been used to pay reimbursable expenditure as established in the call for contributions within the time limits laid down in this Regulation. Time limits to use of EU funds: Parliament called for the possibility to 'build up reserves and carry-over of funds'. The new Title does not prevent European political parties from building reserves from their own sources. In addition, European political parties should also benefit from a certain flexibility regarding the time limits to use the EU funds awarded. However, EU funds that have not been spent should be used within a reasonable time. Financing and pre-financing methods: as in the case of grants, contributions may be paid either through the reimbursement of a percentage of the expenditures incurred or through a system of predefined lump sum, unit costs, and flat rate (forfaits). Contributions should be paid in one pre-financing payment covering 100% of the sum, unless the authorising officer decides otherwise for duly justified reasons. Interest on pre-financing: by derogation from the Financial Regulation, any interest yielded by the pre-financing amounts received by the European political parties should be used to pay reimbursable expenditures within the following two financial years. Penalty and control regime: as in the case for grants, the new Title should include the standard provisions regarding the control of the EP, OLAF, and the Court of Auditors. It should also include the same penalty regime (administrative and financial penalties) which is applicable to grant beneficiaries. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the envisaged modification of the Financial Regulation has no budgetary implications.",EP7

PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2008/9/EC (the Refund Directive) allows for non-established taxable persons to reclaim VAT on business expenses incurred in another Member State (the Member State of refund) via an electronic web portal set up in their own Member State (the Member State of establishment). The Refund Directive states that applications should be submitted to the Member State of establishment at the latest on 30 September of the calendar year following the refund period. As the Directive came into force on 1 January 2010, any applications concerning 2009 are to be submitted to the Member State of establishment by 30 September 2010 at the latest. Some Member States opened their web portals very late (up to the middle of May 2010) and there have been various technical problems with the operability and access to certain portals. Member States have also had divergent views of how the system should operate from a technical point of view, which have only come to light once the system has been operational. This has also contributed to a number of delays and problems in the submission and processing of applications. Following a number of problems incurred in the practical application of the procedure at the level of several Member States, it is proposed to amend the Refund Directive in order to: (i) give taxable persons more time to submit applications relating to refund periods in 2009; (ii) provide that the Commission can adopt the necessary implementing measures following the opinion of the Standing Committee on Administrative Co-operation. IMPACT ANALYSIS: as this measure does not significantly amend the existing measure, no impact assessment is necessary. LEGAL BASIS: Article 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal will extend the deadline for submission of a refund application under Directive 2008/9/EC to 31 March 2011 exceptionally for applications concerning refund periods in 2009, and provide for certain implementing measures to be adopted under the procedure provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax. This would allow the Member States and the Commission to agree on the necessary technical aspects of application of the Directive, and hence improve the running of the system. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no negative impact on the EU budget.",EP7


5136,"""""Macro-financial assistance to Jordan""""",0.895,0.905,0.895,0.323,0.364,0.928,0.903,0.057,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to provide EUR 180 million in macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Jordan. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2011, Jordan's economy has been significantly affected by the domestic events related to the Arab Spring and the ongoing regional unrest. Combined with a weaker global environment, the political transition of Jordan has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. Jordan has also been affected by the intensification of the Syria crisis, notably through the inflow of refugees and its fiscal implications ( about 1000 Syrians crossing Jordanian borders every day). It has welcomed about 180 000 refugees since January 2013. While Jordan has so far managed to date to maintain macroeconomic stability, including through substantial fiscal consolidation efforts and financial support from foreign donors, there are significant balance of payments and financing needs. Under the pressure of a sharp drop of international reserves in the first half of 2012, the Jordanian authorities have agreed on a USD 2 billion (800% of quota), 36-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund, approved on August 2012. In this context, the Jordanian government requested Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU in the amount of EUR 200 million in December 2012. Consequently, the Commission presents this proposal for MFA to the benefit of Jordan amounting to a maximum of EUR 180 million in the form of loans. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed that the Union shall make available to Jordan macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 180 million, with a view to supporting Jordan's economic stabilisation and reforms. The assistance shall contribute to covering Jordan's balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF programme. The full amount of the macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Jordan in the form of loans which shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. The Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions in order to lend them to Jordan. Objective of the loan : the EU's MFA would contribute towards covering Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2013 and 2014, in the context of the IMF programme. It would help Jordan address the lingering economic consequences of the Arab Spring and the external shocks of its energy sector. It would reduce the economy's short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities, while supporting the adjustment and reform programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the reforms agreed under the EU's budgetary support operations. The proposed assistance would: promote policy measures to improve public financial management and tax reform while strengthening the social safety net (including through a better targeting of the cash transfers system); measures to improve the regulatory framework and climate for investment; and reforms to reduce unemployment and encourage participation in the labour market, notably among women. Release measures : the Commission: shall manage the provision of the assistance in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Jordan and with the key principles and objectives of economic reforms set out in the EU-Jordan Association Agreement and the EU-Jordan Action Plan for 2010-2015 agreed under the European Neighbourhood Policy; shall regularly inform the European Parliament and the Economic and Financial Committee of developments in the management of the Union macro-financial assistance and provide them with relevant documents. The Union macro-financial assistance shall be made available for a period of two years from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to the proposal. Other implementing measures : instalments : the assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments and to allow some frontloading given the urgency of the financing needs. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the second half of 2013. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the first half of 2014; disbursement : this assistance is of macroeconomic nature and its design is consistent with the IMF-supported economic programme. The monitoring of the action by the Commission services will take place on the basis of progress in the implementation of the SBA and specific reform measures to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment); management : the assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. Implementing powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The fact that the assistance is of a substantial amount and, therefore, has a potentially important impact, justifies the use of the examination procedure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the MFA would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 04 01 14. Assuming that the first loan disbursement will be made in 2013 for the amount of EUR 100 million and the second loan disbursement in 2014 for the amount of EUR 80 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2015-16 budgets.",EP7

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the above-mentioned Agreement between the EC and its Member States and South Africa (‘TDCA’) entered into force on 1 May 2004. Articles 18 and 103 of the TDCA call for a review of the Agreement within five years of its entry into force. At its meeting of 7 November 2005, the Joint Cooperation Council established the broad lines of the future revision of the TDCA, covering further liberalisation of trade, minor adjustments to the Title on Development Cooperation, updating the wording of several provisions concerning economic cooperation and cooperation in other areas. On that basis, the Commission submitted a proposal for a negotiating mandate in June 2006. In November 2006 the Council adopted a two-tier Decision giving the Commission two mandates. One was to give guidance to the Commission for revising the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation on the basis of Article 106(1) of the TDCA, which gives the Cooperation Council the power to decide on amendments put forward by any Party. The other was to authorise the opening of negotiations between the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other, to revise the Agreement on matters relating to the political dimension of the Agreement and to justice, freedom and security. However, in the course of the negotiations, for the sake of consistency, both sides agreed to forego the ‘lighter’ procedure of Article 106(1) of the TDCA, and to negotiate a single Agreement amending the TDCA. Consequently, the Commission negotiated this Agreement on the basis of the combined negotiating directives adopted by the Council, and in consultation with the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Working Party and the Africa Working Group. These two bodies were appointed by the Council, according to their respective responsibilities, as the special committees to assist the Commission in its task. The TDCA negotiations on trade and trade-related matters were suspended pending the outcome of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations. Throughout the negotiations, the Commission ensured that due account was taken of the process for implementing the Strategic Partnership between South Africa and the EU. The agreement was signed on behalf of the Community and Member States on 11 September 2009 in Kleinmond, South Africa in accordance with Council Decision 7437/08. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218 (6) (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: following the entry into force of the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU is substituting the European Community for the approval of the agreement. As stipulated in Article 3 of the Agreement, the Parties shall notify each other of the completion of the corresponding approval procedures and the respective instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU. As established in Article 4, the Amending Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the month in which the Parties notify each other that the necessary procedures have been completed. The current proposal is for a Council Decision concluding the amending agreement. It contains new provisions on terrorism, the International Criminal Court, weapons of mass destruction, mercenaries and small arms. The Commission therefore recommends that the Council adopt the attached Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union’s budget.",EP7


1644,"""""Vaccination against bluetongue""""",0.754,0.758,0.789,0.613,0.576,0.735,0.841,0.829,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend the European Union’s legislative framework in order to ensure the better control of the spread of the bluetongue virus and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by that disease.  PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 lays down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue, including rules on vaccination. In the past, only sporadic incursions of certain serotypes of the bluetongue virus were recorded in the Union. Those incursions mainly occurred in the southern parts of the Union. However, after the adoption of Directive 2000/75/EC, and particularly after the introduction into the Union of bluetongue virus serotypes 1 and 8 in the years 2006 and 2007, the bluetongue virus has become more widespread in the Union, with the potential of becoming endemic in certain areas. It has therefore become difficult to control the spread of that virus. The rules on vaccination against bluetongue laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC are based on experience of the use of so-called ""modified live vaccines"", or ""live attenuated vaccines"" that were the only vaccines available when that Directive was adopted. In recent years, as a result of new technology, ""inactivated vaccines"" against bluetongue have become available, which do not pose that risk to unvaccinated animals. It is now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for bluetongue control and the prevention of clinical disease in the Union. Under the current rules, the use of vaccines against bluetongue is prohibited outside ""restricted zones"" where the disease has appeared and where animal movement has been restricted. PREFERRED OPTION AND ASSESSMENT OF ITS IMPACTS: the Commission considers that the amendment of the legislation is necessary to reflect the technological progress in the field of vaccine development. The current obstacles for preventive vaccination outside areas subjected to animal movement restrictions are not necessary when modern safe ""inactivated vaccines"" are used. The proposed amendment will facilitate decision making on bluetongue control strategies on the basis of the specific situation within the Member States without unnecessary intervention by the Union. LEGAL BASIS: the legal basis of Directive 2000/75/EC is the second indent of Article 15 of Council Directive 92/119/EEC of 17 December 1992 introducing general Community measures for the control of certain animal diseases and specific measures relating to swine vesicular disease. This article provides that the Council may adopt specific provisions relating to the control and eradication measures for any of the animal diseases listed in Annex I to the Directive, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission. Since the basic act providing for this legal basis is still in force, the legality of the powers vested in the Council in this act are not affected by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and these powers remain solely with the Council. CONTENT: in order to ensure the better control of the spread of the bluetongue virus and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by that disease, it is appropriate to amend the current rules on vaccination laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC in order to take account of the recent technological developments in vaccine production. The proposed amendments should make the rules on vaccination more flexible and also take into account the fact that inactivated vaccines are now available, which can also be successfully used outside areas subjected to animal movement restrictions. T he use of live attenuated vaccines should not be excluded provided that appropriate precautionary measures are taken, as their use might still be necessary under certain circumstances, such as following the introduction of a new bluetongue virus serotype against which inactivated vaccines may not be available.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: this Agreement is presented as a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, signed on 20 November 1995 rather than as a stand alone Agreement. The Protocol will allow Community exporters, if they so choose, to test and certify their industrial products to the same (aligned) requirements prior to export, and then access that market without any further conformity assessment requirements. The certification procedures will only need to be carried out one time for both markets and against the same aligned requirements or standards. The recognition of certification will permit savings and stimulate exports. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 in conjunction the first sentence of the first subparagraph of Article 300(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopts this proposal for a decision to conclude the ACAA with Israel. General principles of the Agreement : the ACAA facilitates market access by eliminating technical barriers to trade with respect to industrial products. To this end, the ACAA provides for two mechanisms: under the first mechanism, mutual recognition of products operates on the basis of the acquis communautaire that has been transposed by the partner country, in the same way as it would apply to products placed on the market of a Member State. It allows industrial products covered by it and attested as compliant according to the procedures of the European Union to be placed on the Israeli market without having to undergo any further approval procedures, and vice versa. At present one sector is included: good manufacturing practice (GMP) for pharmaceutical products. Israel has taken over the Community technical legislation in the sector covered by the Annex to the Protocol and participates in the European organisations in the sector covered by it; the second mechanism, i.e., the mutual acceptance of industrial products not commonly regulated, confirms that Articles 16 and 17 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement with Israel apply without other restriction in the product sectors covered by it. That is, Annexes applying this mechanism will provide that where no European technical regulations exist, industrial products listed under such Annexes lawfully traded in the market of either Party (i.e., on the territory of Israel or that of one of the Member States of the EU) may be lawfully traded in the other. No annexes making this mechanism operational are at present included. Main provisions of the Framework Agreement : Purpose and means : the ACAA aims to eliminate technical barriers to trade in respect to industrial products. The ACAA provides for two mechanisms, as described above. Alignment of legislation : Israel has a commitment to take appropriate measures to take over and maintain measures to align with and maintain Community law, as it applies to products covered by the Agreement. For New Approach sectors (which will be explicitly identified as such in the Annexes that relate to them) there is also an obligation on Israel to maintain relevant transposed standards, in the same way as a Member State of the EU. Infrastructure : Israel is committed to establish and maintain a quality infrastructure equivalent to that of the EU for sectors covered by the Protocol. Mutual acceptance of industrial products : the principles of the two mechanisms underlying the mutual acceptance of products onto the market of the other Party, as described above, are detailed in this Agreement. There is also a provision that, unless otherwise agreed, the ACAA does not entail any obligation, for one Party, to accept product attested as compliant by bodies other than those of the Parties. Safeguard clause : each Party has the right to deny market access when that Party is able to demonstrate that a product might endanger legitimate concerns covered by legislation applicable to the products covered by an Annex (mainly to do with safety or public health). The Annexes will provide for the detailed procedures to be used in such cases. Extension of coverage : Parties may modify the scope and coverage of this Protocol through amendment of the Annexes or by the addition of new ones. Obligations of Parties as regards their responsible authorities and notified bodies : Parties are obliged to ensure that their responsible authorities monitor the technical competence and compliance of their respective notified bodies and have power and expertise for designating, suspending, and withdrawing such bodies. In addition, they are obliged to ensure that their notified bodies comply with the requirements of Community and aligned national law, and maintain their technical competence to carry out the tasks for which they have been notified. Notified bodies : a procedure for the notification of bodies to assess conformity in relation to the legal requirements specified in the corresponding annexes is provided. The procedure is similar to the one applied within the Community. It also sets out the procedure for the withdrawal of notified bodies. Verification of notified bodies : each Party has the right to request a verification of a body notified by the other Party. The verification may be done either by the authorities which have designated the body or together by the authorities of both Parties. The notified body would be suspended until a final decision is taken. Exchange of information : measures are provided as regards the transparency provision. This provision ensures uniform application and interpretation of the Protocol. It also provides for the Parties to encourage their notified bodies to co-operate to establish mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sphere. Confidentiality : this standard provision prohibits disclosing information acquired under this Protocol. Management of the Agreement : responsibility for the effective functioning of this Agreement shall be borne by the Committee (subcommittee ""Industry, trade and services"" - set up and designated for trade purposes under Article 73 of the Association Agreement). Its main tasks shall be to add and amend Annexes, appoint experts for verifications, consider new arrangements, and resolve questions related to the Protocol. Technical co-operation and assistance : measures are provided as regards technical co-operation and assistance with a view to properly implementing this Protocol. Agreements with other countries : the agreement can be extended to other countries by explicit agreement, and encourages - but does not force - Israel to make agreements similar to the Protocol, and covering the same products, that the EU might make with another country. Annexes annex on Mutual Acceptance of Industrial Products: there is one Annex, covering good manufacturing practice (GMP) for pharmaceutical products. It operates by the mechanism described above whereby mutual recognition of products operates on the basis of the acquis communautaire that has been transposed by Israel. Advanced therapy products, special medicinal products based on tissues and cells of human origin, and medicinal products that include blood products shall not be concerned. The inclusion of these fields may be agreed between the Parties if the Israeli legislation governing them is brought into alignment; annexes on Mutual Acceptance of Industrial Products no commonly regulated: no such annexes have been negotiated for the moment. The ACAA provides nevertheless the basis for such acceptance of products. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the European Union budget.",EP7


6104,"""""Rail transport statistics""""",0.035,0.883,0.965,0.516,0.394,0.867,0.908,0.657,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to modify Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 in order to update, simplify and optimise the existing legal framework for European statistics on rail transport and to align it with the new institutional context. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Eurostat’s rail transport statistics are predominantly based on Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1192/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 332/2007. These Regulations cover passenger and freight transport by rail, as well as rail safety. The Commission needs statistics on the transport of goods and passengers by rail in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy. Detailed rail transport statistics for goods and passengers and information on intermodality are necessary to monitor the targets set in the 2011 Commission’s White Paper. Eurostat has conducted a technical analysis of the existing data on rail statistics collected under the Union legislation and of the dissemination policy, within its Working Group and Task Force on rail transport statistics. In its report to the European Parliament and the Council on the experience acquired in the application of the Regulation (EC) No 91/2003, the Commission mentions that long term developments will probably mean the suppression or simplification of the data already collected under the Regulation, and that the intention is to reduce the data transmission period for annual data on rail passengers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal is the result of in-depth negotiations between all interested parties. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is thus to modify Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 in order to update, simplify and optimise the existing legal framework for European statistics on rail transport and to align it with the new institutional context. Data on transport of passengers : in line with Annexes C and D to Regulation (EC) 91/2003 on rail transport statistics, countries are currently required to provide annual statistics on passenger transport, under detailed and/or simplified reporting. The Commission proposed to delete Annex D (simplified reporting) and the provisional Tables C1 and C2 in Annex C, while shortening the deadline for providing the final passenger data from 14 months to eight months after the end of the reference period. Data on transport of goods : in the interests of consistency, it is also proposed to delete Annex B (simplified reporting). New Annex : as it is proposed to abandon the current concept of ‘simplified’ reporting, for the smallest undertakings below the specified thresholds, Member States would have to report a ‘total’ figure for aggregated indicators in Annex L. Data on accidents : as data on accidents are also collected by the European Rail Agency, it is proposed to delete Annex H (statistics on accidents). Annex I : as the concept of ‘simplified’ reporting will disappear, it is proposed to delete this Annex as it is currently used only to validate coverage between simplified and detailed reporting in relation to the total rail activity of undertakings. Thresholds : the present thresholds are established for tonne-km and passenger-km, i.e. multiplication of tonnes/passengers transported and the distance covered in kilometres. As significant rail activity involves only small distances in some Member States, it is proposed to decrease the thresholds both for goods and passengers, in order to minimise the loss of important data. For the same reason, a double threshold in tonnes transported and in tonne-km is proposed for goods. Transit data : it is proposed that ‘Rail Waybill’ information (if available) be used when administrative data are used as the data source. Lastly, the proposed amendment of Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 takes into account the necessary adjustments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards granting the Commission delegated and implementing powers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).",EP7

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation Brussels I is the basis for civil judicial cooperation in the EU. It applies in a broad range of matters, covering not only contractual but also delict and proprietary claims. It identifies the most appropriate jurisdiction for solving a cross-border dispute and ensures the smooth recognition and enforcement of judgments issued in another Member State. While the Regulation is overall considered to work successfully, the consultation of stakeholders and a number of studies revealed deficiencies in the current operation of the Regulation which should be remedied. Essentially, four main shortcomings can be identified: the procedure for recognition and enforcement of a judgment in another Member State (""exequatur"") remains an obstacle to the free circulation of judgments. It entails unnecessary costs and delays for the parties involved and deters companies and citizens from making full use of the internal market; access to justice in the EU is overall unsatisfactory in disputes involving defendants from outside the EU. With some exceptions, the current Regulation only applies where the defendant is domiciled within the EU. Otherwise jurisdiction is governed by national law. The diversity of national law leads to unequal access to justice for EU companies in transactions with partners from third countries: some can easily litigate in the EU, others cannot, even in situations where no other court guaranteeing a fair trial is competent. In addition, where national legislation does not grant access to court in disputes with parties outside the EU, the enforcement of mandatory EU law protecting e.g. consumers, employees or commercial agents is not guaranteed; the efficiency of choice of court agreements needs to be improved. Currently, the Regulation obliges the court designated by the parties in a choice of court agreement to stay proceedings if another court has been seised first. This rule enables litigants acting in bad faith to delay the resolution of the dispute in the agreed forum by first seizing a non-competent court. This possibility creates additional costs and delays and undermines the legal certainty and predictability of dispute resolution; the interface between arbitration and litigation needs to be improved. Arbitration is excluded from the scope of the Regulation. However, by challenging an arbitration agreement before a court, a party may effectively undermine the arbitration agreement and create a situation of inefficient parallel court proceedings which may lead to irreconcilable resolutions of the dispute. This leads to additional costs and delays, undermines the predictability of dispute resolution and creates incentives for abusive litigation tactics. LEGAL BASE: Article 81 (2) (a), (c) and (e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed the costs and benefits of the main aspects of the proposed reform in its Impact Assessment which accompanies the proposal. CONTENT: the objective of the proposal is to remove the remaining obstacles to the free movement of judicial decisions in line with the principle of mutual recognition. The proposed elements of the reform are as follows: Abolition of the intermediate procedure for the recognition and enforcement of judgments (exequatur): today, judicial cooperation and the level of trust among Member States has reached a degree of maturity which permits the move towards a simpler, less costly, and more automatic system of circulation of judgments, removing the existing formalities among Member States. The proposal therefore abolishes the exequatur procedure for all judgments covered by the Regulation's scope with the exception of judgments in defamation and compensatory collective redress cases. The abolition of exequatur will be accompanied by procedural safeguards which ensure that the defendant's right to a fair trial and his rights of defence are adequately protected. The proposal outlines remedies available to a defendant to enable him to prevent, in exceptional circumstances, a judgment given in one Member State taking effect in another Member State. These safeguards address the situations which are currently addressed by certain of the existing refusal grounds, in particular in order to ensure the protection of the rights of the defence, with the key difference that control of substantive public policy is abolished. As such, the time and costs of the exequatur procedure will be saved while the protection of defendants is ensured. The proposal also contains a series of standard forms which aim at facilitating the recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment in the absence of the exequatur procedure as well as the application for a review under the procedure safeguarding the rights of defence. These forms will facilitate the enforcement of the judgment by the competent authorities, in particular where interest and costs have to be calculated. They also reduce the need for a translation of the judgment and ease the application for a review of the judgment by the defendant who has to act in another Member State. Extension of the jurisdiction rules of the Regulation to disputes involving third country defendants: this amendment will generally extend the ability of companies and citizens to sue third country defendants in the EU because the special rules of jurisdiction which e.g. establish jurisdiction at the place of contractual performance become available in these cases. More specifically, the amendment will ensure that the protective jurisdiction rules available for consumers, employees and insured will also apply if the defendant is domiciled outside the EU. The proposal further harmonises the subsidiary jurisdiction rules and creates two additional fora for disputes involving defendants domiciled outside the EU: it provides that a non-EU defendant can be sued at the place where moveable assets belonging to him are located provided their value is not disproportionate to the value of the claim and that the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court seised; the courts of a Member State will be able to exercise jurisdiction if no other forum guaranteeing the right to a fair trial is available and the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State concerned (""forum necessitatis""). The proposal introduces a discretionary lis pendens rule for disputes on the same subject matter and between the same parties which are pending before the courts in the EU and in a third country. A court of a Member State can exceptionally stay proceedings if a non-EU court was seised first and it is expected to decide within a reasonable time and the decision will be capable of recognition and enforcement in that Member State. This amendment aims at avoiding parallel proceedings within and outside the EU. Enhancement of the effectiveness of choice of court agreements : the proposal includes two amendments with this in mind: where the parties have designated a particular court to resolve their dispute, the proposal gives priority to the chosen court to decide on its jurisdiction, regardless of whether it is first or second seised. Any other court has to stay proceedings until the chosen court has established or – in case the agreement is invalid – declined jurisdiction; the proposal introduces a harmonised conflict of law rule on the substantive validity of choice of court agreements, thus ensuring a similar outcome on this matter whatever the court seised. Improvement of the interface between the Regulation and arbitration : the proposal obliges a court seised of a dispute to stay proceedings if its jurisdiction is contested on the basis of an arbitration agreement and an arbitral tribunal has been seised of the case or court proceedings relating to the arbitration agreement have been commenced in the Member State of the seat of the arbitration. This modification will enhance the effectiveness of arbitration agreements in Europe, prevent parallel court and arbitration proceedings, and eliminate the incentive for abusive litigation tactics. Better coordination of proceedings before the courts of Member States : the proposal contains the following provisions: it aims at improving the general lis pendens rule by prescribing a time limit for the court first seised to decide on its jurisdiction. In addition, the amendment provides for an exchange of information between the courts seised of the same matter; it facilitates the consolidation of related actions by doing away with the requirement that consolidation has to be possible under national law; regarding provisional, and protective measures, the proposal provides for the free circulation of those measures which have been granted by a court having jurisdiction on the substance of the case, including – subject to certain conditions – measures which have been granted ex parte. By contrast, the proposal prevents the circulation of provisional measures ordered by a court other than the one having jurisdiction on the substance. Given the wide divergence of national law on this issue, the effect of these measures should be limited to the territory of the Member State where they were granted, thereby preventing the risk of abusive forum-shopping; if proceedings on the substance are pending in one court and another one is asked to issue a provisional measure, the proposal requires the two courts to cooperate in order to ensure that all circumstances of the case are taken into account when a provisional measure is granted. Improvement of access to justice for certain specific disputes: provisions include: the creation of a forum for claims of rights in rem at the place where moveable assets are located; the possibility for employees to bring actions against multiple defendants in the employment area. This will benefit employees who wish to bring proceedings against joint employers established in different Member States; the possibility of concluding a choice of court agreement for disputes concerning the tenancy of premises for professional use, and the mandatory information of a defendant entering an appearance about the legal consequences of not contesting the court's jurisdiction. and clarification of the conditions under which provisional and protective measures can circulate in the EU.",EP7

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the European Council of 27 and 28 June 2013, it was considered that a budgetary solution should be found to address certain issues stemming from the final outcome of the negotiations of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 for those Member States most affected, namely France, Italy and Spain. In view of the current economic crisis, as a contribution to the special effort needed to address the specific situations of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and of poverty and social exclusion in these Member States, the European Social Fund allocations to those three Member States for the year 2013 should be increased. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The Commission is proposing to amend Council Regulation (EC) 1083/2006 with a view to providing France, Italy and Spain with EUR 100 million, EUR 30 million and EUR 20 million respectively as additional commitments to their 2013 ESF allocations. Nonetheless, since the amounts in the regulation are expressed in 2004 prices, the corresponding amounts quoted in the regulation total EUR 126 million broken down as follows: EUR 84 million for France, EUR 17 million for Spain, and EUR 25 million for Italy. The compensation will be provided from the 2007-2013 period with the amounts been made available through the flexibility instrument. From a legal perspective, it is proposed to: modify the Regulation’s articles dealing with: (i) global resources; (ii) on the resources available for the Convergence objective; (iii) the resources available for the Regional competitiveness and employment objective and (iv) budget commitments; modify Annex I on the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations and Annex II on the criteria and methodology for the allocation of the resources.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 42, first subparagraph and Article 43(2) TFEU. CONTENT: Articles 290 and 291 TFEU establish a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts and, on the other, the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts: Article 290 TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as delegated acts; Article 291 TFEU requires Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to as implementing acts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no need for an impact assessment since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to align Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to the new requirements of Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. The proposal is based on a careful qualification of the existing Commission powers under Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as ""delegated"" and ""implementing"". This was done against the background of the implementing measures adopted by the Commission on the basis of its current powers. With regard to Article 290 TFEU , a Commission delegated act may determine the additional elements necessary for the proper functioning of the common market organisation established by the Legislator. For example, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in order to lay down the conditions for operators for taking part in a scheme, the obligations deriving from the issue of a licence and, if necessary depending on the economic situation, whether it requires a guarantee for issue of licences. Similarly, the Legislator delegates to the Commission the power to adopt measures to establish eligibility criteria for products as regards market intervention. In addition, the Commission may adopt delegated acts regarding definitions. With regard to Article 291 TFEU , the proposal specifies that in order to ensure that the CMO is implemented in Member States in a uniform manner and to avoid unfair competition or discrimination between operators, the Commission will be able to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 291(2) of the Treaty. The Commission will, therefore, be granted implementing powers under that provision, in particular as regards the uniform conditions under which market intervention measures apply, the uniform conditions for implementing aid schemes and for applying rules concerning marketing and production, and rules related to trade with Third countries. The Commission should also define the minimum characteristics for checks which Member States must apply. In this proposal, the Commission also deals with Council powers under Article 43(3) TFEU. This provision stipulates that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aids and quantitative limitations. The provision forms an exception to Article 43(2) TFEU which requires the ordinary legislative procedure to be used to establish the common organisation of agricultural markets and the other provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common agricultural policy. This reflects the general trend in the Lisbon Treaty which has turned the ordinary legislative procedure into the standard procedure for the adoption of EU legislative acts. As an exception Article 43(3) TFEU needs to be interpreted restrictively so as to ensure that the Legislator can exercise its legislative prerogatives under Article 43(2) TFEU. This includes the Legislator regulating the fundamental elements of the common agricultural policy and taking the political decisions that shape its structure, instruments and effects. Against this background the specific procedure laid down in Art. 43(3) TFEU should only be applied where an issue referred to in that provision does not form part of the fundamental policy decisions reserved to the Legislator under Article 43(2) TFEU. Therefore, where such an issue is inextricably linked with the political substance of the decisions to be taken by the Legislator, Article 43(3) TFEU should not be applied. Consequently, the proposal is based on the following principles: the structural parameters and fundamental elements of the CAP may only be decided by the Legislator. For example, the public intervention (including the framework for the determination by the Commission of certain intervention prices by means of the tendering procedure) and milk and sugar quota schemes established by Regulation 1234/2007 should be decided by the Legislator, as these elements are inextricably linked to the definition of the content of the scheme established by the Legislator and the boundaries of this regime; measures on fixing prices, levies, aids and quantitative limitations as referred to in Article 43(3) which do not fall in the scope of Article 43(2) TFEU shall be taken by the Council. The Commission will submit a proposal for a Regulation based on Article 43(3) TFEU as regards the provisions in Article 21 on the conditions for mandatory aid for private storage of butter, in Article 99 on the production refund in the sugar sector, in Articles 101 and 102 on aids in the milk and milk products sector, in Article 108 on the supply of milk products to pupils, in Article 155 on aids in the silkworm sector, in Article 273 on export refunds and in Article 281 on live plants minimum export prices. The proposed Regulations will, in respect of these provisions, provide that the conditions for fixing of aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should be determined by the Council under Article 43(3) TFEU and that amounts of such aids, refunds and price levels should be fixed by the Commission by means of implementing acts. The Commission will submit the proposals that need to be made with regard to Article 43(3) TFEU in due course to the Council. Lastly, the content of the following proposals is integrated into this proposal: European Parliament legislative resolution of 23 November on the proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation) as regards the aid granted in the framework of the German Alcohol Monopoly; proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007, as regards distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union; proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards marketing standards; proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: drug precursors are chemical substances having a wide variety of licit uses, such as in the synthesis of plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, perfumes, detergents, or aromas. They are traded for legitimate purposes on global markets, but some of them can also be diverted from the licit distribution channels for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs. Taking into account the wide legitimate uses of drug precursors, their trade cannot be prohibited. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are chemical substances used for the manufacture of cold or allergy medicines. These two substances are also the main precursors for the manufacture of methamphetamine. While ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are controlled at international and EU level, the medicinal products containing them are not controlled when they are exported from or transiting through the Union customs territory. They are targeted by drug traffickers as a source of precursors for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine because the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine contained in these products can be easily extracted. Extent of the problem: in 2009, almost 7 400 seizures of methamphetamine, amounting to about 600 kg of the drug, were reported in Europe. Both the number of seizures and quantities increased over 2004-2009. In 2009, illicit methamphetamine laboratories were seized for the first time in several European countries. This is an indication that methamphetamine markets may be expanding in Europe. Seizures of methamphetamine precursors contained in medicinal products have fluctuated considerably from 2007 until 2010. At European level, while in 2007 hardly any preparations were recorded out of the overall quantities seized, in 2008 and 2009 the amount of preparations out of the total quantities seized increased sharply and decreased considerably again in 2010. After the continued increase of seizures of medicinal products from 2007 to 2009, as a result of strengthened controls of medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in several countries, particularly in Mexico and countries in Central America, the total amount of medicinal products seized worldwide decreased in 2010. However, the increasing or decreasing level of seizures is only one indicator to illustrate that illicit manufacture is taking place in a given part of the world. The absence of a control mechanism for medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine remains a concern both at European and at global level. Medicinal products for human use containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine are excluded from the provisions of Regulation (EC) 111/2005, which applies to trade in drug precursors between the EU and third countries. This has led to a situation where these products could not be stopped or seized by Member States' competent authorities when these products were exported from or transiting through the Union customs territory, even though it was very likely that they would be misused for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine in their country of destination. Directive 2011/62/EU which relates to the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of falsified medicinal products addresses the distribution chain for medicines within the EU, importation of active substances, and 'introduction' of medicines, i.e. medicines brought into the customs territory without the intention of placing them on the market. These provisions are focused on preventing products that fall within the definition of falsified medicinal products from entering the legal supply chain. Given that the principal issue with drug precursors is one of legitimately produced products leaving the legal supply chain, it is unlikely that these provisions will make a significant contribution to tackling the issue of controlling medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine being exported or transiting through the EU. The EU is criticised internationally for not taking adequate control measures across Member States to tackle this weakness. By imposing EU control over these medicinal products, this proposal is aiming to make it more difficult, expensive and risky for criminals to source the chemicals they need to manufacture drugs. The proposal should work as a deterrent: it focuses on preventing the diversion of precursors. It concentrates on the supply reduction of the chemicals to make drugs and not on the supply of the drugs for the consumers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment report identified and assessed five policy options: Option 1: ""baseline scenario"": the status quo would be maintained. Option 2: voluntary measures by Member States to improve the situation. Option 3: giving authorities power to stop suspicious shipments. Option 4: giving authorities power to stop suspicious shipments and pre-export notification of legal shipments. Option 5: full control of trade in medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The impact assessment concluded that Option 4 would be the most suitable one to address the problem, as it would: (i) provide for a legal basis, (ii) impose only one extra control requirement and (iii) generate hardly any additional administrative burden. The proposal notes that even though Option 5 could be considered the most effective by applying the strictest controls, the requirements would be disproportionate to the objective pursued by the present initiative. The added value provided by Option 4 compared to Option 3 is that, under the former Option, the synergy of two combined measures increases the effectiveness of each individual measure. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal provides that any export of medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine should be preceded by a pre-export notification sent by the competent authorities in the Union to the competent authorities of the country of destination. The pre-export notification system is up and running and measures are already compulsory for scheduled substances of Category 1. The proposal contains compulsory measures for the products containing Category 1 substances, such as medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Member States' competent authorities will be given the powers to stop or seize those products when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they are intended for the illicit drug manufacture, when they are exported, imported or in transit. At the moment, most customs authorities can only seize ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as raw substances. The European Database on drug precursors created by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 will be used to: ·  simplify Member States’ reporting with regard to seizures and stopped shipments in accordance with Article 12(12) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988; ·  establish a European register of operators holding a licence or a registration, which will facilitate verification of the legitimacy of their transactions involving scheduled substances and enable operators to provide the competent authorities with information about their export, import or intermediary activities involving scheduled substances. The proposal contains some other amendments aiming at facilitating the implementation of the Regulation and at increasing its effectiveness, the main ones being: ·  the possibility of amending the Annex to the Regulation in order to react more quickly to new emerging trends in precursors diversion; ·  a review clause to assess whether the amended Regulation will have been effective to prevent the diversion of medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine; ·  the adaptation of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 in accordance with the rules on delegated and implementing acts under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not have an impact on human resources and on the European Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by a financial statement. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 111/2005, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be delegated to the Commission for specific purposes listed in the text.",EP7
