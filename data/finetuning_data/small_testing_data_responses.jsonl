PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007, which entered into force in December 2009, rail passengers have rights to information, reservations and tickets, assistance, care and compensation in the event of a delay or cancellation, free of charge assistance (for persons with disabilities), compensation in the event of an accident or quick access to a complaint handling system. In its 2013 report on the application of the Regulation, the Commission highlighted certain problematic areas which were confirmed by an impact assessment in 2016/2017. With this proposal to recast the existing legislation, the Commission wishes to better protect passengers no matter where they travel in the EU. It aligns rail with general aspects of passenger rights legislation on other transport modes, notably non-discrimination, contingency planning, disability training, complaint handling and enforcement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were broken down, in a sequential approach analysing and comparing costs and benefits and selecting a preferred policy scenario per theme: (i) exemptions; (ii) the applicability of the rights of persons with reduced mobility to all services; (iii) information for persons with reduced mobility; (iv) assistance to persons with reduced mobility; (v) handling of complaints and monitoring of enforcement by national enforcement agencies; (vi) definition of throughticket; (viii) force majeure; (ix) information for all travellers; (x) non-discrimination. CONTENT: the main elements of proposal recasting Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 are as follows: Uniform application of rules : to date, many Member States have frequently used national exemptions, which deprive travellers to a large extent of their rights. The proposal: removes exemptions for long-distance domestic services by 2020; removes exemptions for cross-border urban, suburban and regional services; requires that Member States grant exemptions only if they can prove that passengers are adequately protected on their territory. The Commission proposal updates the existing rules on rail passenger rights in five key areas: Information and non-discrimination : in order to improve provision of information about passenger rights at booking, the proposal: requires such information to be printed on the ticket or electronically. Notices informing passengers of their rights have to be placed in prominent positions in stations and on board; provides for passengers to be given fuller information on through tickets. Railway undertakings and ticket vendors have to make efforts to offer through tickets. They must prove that they informed passengers where their passenger rights do not apply to the whole journey but only to its segments; introduces a general clause prohibiting any form of discrimination, e.g. based on nationality, residence, location or currency of payment. Better rights for persons with disabilities or reduced mobility : mandatory right to assistance on all services and full compensation for loss or repair of mobility equipment. Relevant information has to be given in accessible formats and rail staff must receive disability awareness training. Enforcement, complaint-handling and sanctions : the proposal clarifies the procedure and deadlines for passengers to lodge complaints. It specifies the responsibilities of national enforcement bodies in cross-border cases and requires them to cooperate effectively. Force majeure : in 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the current Regulation does not allow for railway undertakings to be exempted from compensating passengers for delays caused by force majeure, thus creating a distinction between rail and other modes of transport. The proposal introduces a 'force majeure' clause which would exempt railway undertakings from paying compensation for delays only in very exceptional situations caused by severe weather conditions and natural disasters. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"response": "Proposed legislation is likely to attract the support of the General Majority for a vote.\nThe political direction is supportive of passenger rights and non-discrimination. The wording of the proposal is clear and aims to update and protect passengers in the EU in case of delays, cancellations, or discrimination. The framing is also positive, highlighting issues experienced and addressing them with solutions. The topic 'Rail passengers' rights and obligations' is relevant and aims to make travelling by rail more accessible and fair for all passengers, including persons with disabilities or reduced mobility. The legislation is important for the EU and its citizens, and will likely receive support from Leftist parties, who often focus on social issues and protections.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households\u2019 access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion."}, {"response": "Vote: 0.784706 EPP, 0.695646 S&D, 0.908045 RENEW, 0.111260 GREENS/EFA, 0.933174 ECR, 0.295752 THE LEFT, 0.051563 ID, 0.461501 EFD, 0.488259 NI\nMajority type: General"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: on 26 March 2010, the European Council agreed to the European Commission's proposal to launch a new strategy for jobs and growth, Europe 2020, based on enhanced coordination of economic policies, which will focus on the key areas where action is needed to boost Europe\u2019s potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness. To that end, the European Council agreed to set EU headline targets, which constitute shared objectives guiding action of the Member States and of the Union. The Treaty on the functioning of the EU provides that Member States are to regard their economic policies and promoting employment as matters of common concern and coordinate them within the Council. In two distinct articles, it provides that the Council is to adopt broad economic policy guidelines (Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article 148), specifying that the latter must be consistent with the former. Given this legal basis, the guidelines for employment and economic policies are presented as two distinct \u2014 but intrinsically interconnected \u2014 legal instruments: A Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union -Part I of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines; A Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States \u2013Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines. These guidelines implemented by the above mentioned legal instruments form together the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. The employment guidelines were adopted on 21 October 2010, and as provided by the adoption decision should remain stable until 2014 to ensure a focus on implementation. The overall objectives and priorities expressed in the guidelines for the employment policies remain valid. Consequently, with this proposal, the Commission maintains the guidelines adopted in 2010. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission proposes that the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States set out in the Annex to Council Decision of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States are maintained for 2014 as they were in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since 1984, EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit when a directive (Directive 1984/253/EEC) harmonised the procedures for the approval of auditors. Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, was adopted in 2006 and considerably broadened the scope of the former Directive. The financial crisis has highlighted weaknesses in the statutory audit especially with regard to Public-Interest Entities (PIE), such as banks insurance companies and listed companies. Given that many banks revealed huge losses from 2007 to 2009 on the positions they had held both on and off balance sheet, it is difficult for many citizens and investors to understand how auditors could give clean audit reports to their clients (in particular banks) for those periods. Statutory auditors and audit firms play an important role in society. They are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits of public-interest entities with a view to enhancing the degree of confidence of the public in the annual and consolidated financial statements of such entities. In view of the public interest, better audit quality would contribute to the orderly functioning of markets by enhancing the integrity and efficiency of financial statements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment resulted in the following preferred policy options: \u00b7 the scope of statutory audit should be clarified and specified and the information that the auditor provides to users, the audited entities, audit committees and supervisors improved; \u00b7 the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services to the audited entities and even the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services in general would effectively address the need to reinforce independence and professional scepticism. Moreover, stricter rules in the procedure for the appointment of auditors and the introduction of mandatory audit firm rotation would contribute to higher quality audits; \u00b7 in order to facilitate an objective choice of an audit provider, contractual clauses limiting audit firm choice should be prohibited, the transparency on audit quality and on audit firms should be increased and an audit quality certification should be established; \u00b7 ownership restrictions should be lifted in order to increase the choice of audit providers; \u00b7 national audit supervisory authorities should be strengthened and an EU-wide cooperation within the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should be set up. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal lays down conditions for carrying out the statutory audit on the financial statements of PIEs. Directive 2006/43/EC already deals with certain requirements which apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. Those requirements will no longer be comprised in the Directive, but integrated (and further developed) in this Regulation. The main points are as follows: Conditions for carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities : \u00b7 an auditor should establish adequate policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Regulation regarding independence, internal quality control systems and the supervision of employees; \u00b7 former auditors, key audit partners or their employees are not allowed to take up a key management position in the audited entity, to become a member of the audit committee of the audited entity, to become a non-executive member of the administrative body or to join the supervisory body of the audited entity within two years after the termination of the audit engagement; \u00b7 the statutory auditor, audit firm or member of the audit firm's network will be prevented from providing certain non-audit services to their audited entities. For other non-services that are not fundamentally incompatible with the audit services, the audit committee or the competent authority will be empowered to assess whether or not they may be provided to the audited entity; \u00b7 audit firms of significant size should focus their professional activity on the carrying out of statutory audit and should not be allowed to undertake non- audit services; \u00b7 the content of the audit report disclosed to the public is expanded so that it: (i) explains the methodology used, especially how much of the balance sheet has been directly verified and how much has been based on system and compliance testing, the levels of materiality applied to perform the audit, the key areas of risk of material misstatements of the financial statements; (ii) explains whether the statutory audit was designed to detect fraud and, (iii) in the event of a qualified or adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, explain the reasons for such a decision; \u00b7 the auditor should also prepare a longer and more detailed report for the audit committee. This report would provide more detailed information on the audit carried out, on the situation of the undertaking as such (e. g. going concern) and the findings of the audit combined with the necessary explanations; \u00b7 the auditor should keep certain documents and information for a period of five years. The appointment of statutory auditors or audit firms by public-interest entities: \u00b7 in order to reinforce the independence and capacity of the audit committee, the latter should be composed of non-executive members, at least one member should have experience and knowledge in auditing and another one in accounting and/or auditing; \u00b7 the proposal for the appointment of the auditor to the meeting of shareholders should be based on a recommendation of the audit committee. Unless it concerns the renewal of an audit engagement, the recommendation should contain at least two choices (excluding the incumbent auditor) and the audit committee should express a justified preference for one of them. The recommendation of the audit committee should be made after the completion of a due tendering process; \u00b7 the proposal introduces mandatory rotation of audit firms after a maximum period of 6 years that may be, under certain exceptional circumstances, extended to 8 years; \u00b7 where a public-interest entity has appointed two or more statutory auditors or audit firms, the maximum duration of the engagements will be 9 years; on an exceptional basis, such duration may be extended to 12 years. It also provides for a cooling-off period before the audit firm is able to carry out the statutory audit of the same entity again. Surveillance of the activities of auditors and audit firms carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities: \u00b7 each Member State should designate a competent authority responsible for the supervision of auditors and audit firms auditing PIEs. The proposal requires that the EU-wide cooperation between competent authorities takes place within ESMA; \u00b7 a 'voluntary' pan-European audit quality certification is introduced to increase the visibility, recognition and reputation of all audit firms having capacities to conduct high quality audits of PIEs. ESMA should publish the requirements for obtaining the certificate along with any administrative and fee implications. Supervisory measures and penalties: administrative pecuniary sanctions on auditors and PIEs for identified violations are envisaged. Authorities should be transparent about the sanctions and measures they apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no direct or indirect impact on the European Union budget. In particular, tasks that would be entrusted to EU supervisory bodies as mentioned in the proposal would not entail additional EU funding. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}, {"response": "EPS can/will/will not RESOLUTION (EC) No 416/15 IN THE ANNEX of the Agriculture about the over-the-counter (OTC) trade of derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it can be estimated that around one million workers are posted each year by their employers from one Member State to another. Posting thus concerns 0.4% of the active population of EU-15 sending countries and 0.7% of the active population of EU-12 sending countries. In terms of labour mobility within the EU, the number of postings represented 18.5% of non-national EU-27 citizens in the labour force in 2007. The economic importance of posting exceeds by far its quantitative size, as it can play a crucial economic role in filling temporary shortfalls in the labour supply in certain professions or sectors (e.g. construction and transport). Furthermore, the posting of workers enhances international trade in services with all advantages linked to the Single Market such as higher competition, and efficiency gains. Posted workers are covered by Directive 96/71/EC (the Posting of Workers Directive). The Directive aims to reconcile the freedom to provide cross-border services under Article 56 TFEU with appropriate protection of the rights of workers temporarily posted abroad for that purpose. It sets out mandatory rules at EU level that must be applied to posted workers in the host country, and establishes a core set of clearly defined terms and conditions of work and employment that must be complied with by the service provider in the host country to ensure the minimum protection of workers. The Directive thus provides a significant level of protection for workers and also plays a key role in promoting a climate of fair competition between all service providers by guaranteeing both a level playing field and legal certainty for service providers, service recipients, and workers posted for the provision of services. However, the Commission\u2019s evaluation of the Directive in 2003 identified several deficiencies and problems of incorrect implementation. Guidelines adopted in 2006 aimed at clarifying the extent to which certain national control measures could be justified in view of the Court of Justice\u2019s jurisprudence. In its Communication of 2007 the Commission highlighted several shortcomings as regards the way controls were carried out in some Member States and the poor quality of administrative cooperation and access to information. The judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking-Line, Laval, R\u00fcffert and Commission v Luxembourg cases triggered an intense debate among EU institutions, academics and social partners. This focused on two major issues: \u00b7 how to set the right balance between the exercise by trade unions of their right to take collective action, including the right to strike, and the economic freedoms enshrined in the TFEU, in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services; \u00b7 how to interpret some key provisions in Directive 96/71/EC, such as the concept of public policy, the material scope of the terms and conditions of employment imposed by the Directive and the nature of mandatory rules, in particular the minimum wage. In October 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution, calling on all Member States properly to enforce the Posting of Workers Directive and emphasised that the freedom to provide services as one of the cornerstones of the European project should be balanced, on the one hand, against fundamental rights and the social objectives of the Treaties and on the other hand, against the right of the public and social partners to ensure non-discrimination, equal treatment and the improvement of living and working conditions. By facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition, this initiative will allow the potential for growth offered by the posting of workers and jobs for posted workers to be tapped as a key element in the provision of services in the internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives based on an external study. All options were analysed against the following specific objectives: \u00b7 better protection of the rights of posted workers; \u00b7 facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition; \u00b7 improving legal certainty as regards the balance between social rights and economic freedoms, in particular in the context of the posting of workers. The preferred option is a combination of different measures. A package of regulatory measures to deal with the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of the minimum working conditions and with the abuse of posted worker status in order to evade or circumvent legislation, combined with non- regulatory measures to deal with controversial or unclear interpretation of the terms and conditions of employment required by Directive 96/71/EC, is considered to be overall the most effective and efficient solution to address the specific objectives. Furthermore, a positive impact on SMEs and especially micro-businesses can be expected thanks to the improved and clearer regulatory environment. Micro-businesses will not be excluded from the of the proposal scope because this would undermine one of the proposal's key objectives - the fight against letter box companies - and it would create considerable new loopholes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: without re-opening Directive 96/71/EC, this proposal aims to improve, enhance and reinforce the way in which the latter Directive is applied and enforced in practice across the EU. It aims to establish a general common framework of appropriate provisions and measures for better and more uniform implementation, application and enforcement of the Directive, including measures to prevent any circumvention or abuse of the rules. It ensures at the same time guarantees for the protection of posted workers\u2019 rights and the removal of unjustified obstacles to the free provision of services. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a Regulation clarifying the exercise of the right to take collective action within the context of the economic freedoms of the Single Market. Preventing abuse and circumvention - elements improving implementation and better monitoring of application of the notion of posting: the proposal: \u00b7 clarifies the definition of \u2018posted worker\u2019 laid down in Directive 96/71/EC42, since it has often been difficult to determine whether there is a posting within the meaning of the Directive. Abuses have also been committed by employers exploring insufficient clarity of the legal provisions in order to circumvent the applicable rules; \u00b7 the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place is further clarified in the context of administrative cooperation. Access to information: access to advance information about the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country is a prerequisite for interested parties to be able to provide services in compliance with Directive 96/71/EC. The proposal contains a number of more detailed measures to help ensure easily accessible and generally available information on the terms and conditions to be respected, including where these are laid down in collective agreements. Administrative cooperation and mutual assistance : the proposal lays down: \u00b7 the general principles, rules and procedures necessary for effective administrative cooperation and assistance; \u00b7 the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place; \u00b7 an appropriate legal basis for the use of the separate and specific application of the Internal Market Information System (\u2018IMI\u2019) as the electronic information exchange system to facilitate administrative cooperation on the posting of workers; \u00b7 accompanying measures to develop, facilitate, support, promote and further improve administrative cooperation and to increase mutual trust, including through financial support. Monitoring compliance : these provisions cover national control measures, including those which may be applied to legally resident and lawfully employed third-country nationals who are posted within the EU by their employer, as well as inspections. A review clause has been included in order to evaluate the situation further, in particular to examine the necessity and appropriateness of the application of national control measures in the light of the experiences with the functioning of the system of administrative cooperation as well as technological developments. In its case law, the ECJ has further clarified the compatibility of certain national control measures with EU law. The Commission discusses the relevant case law and states that it is considered appropriate to clarify this case law by codifying it in the proposal, indicating clearly which requirements are compatible with obligations under EU law and which are not. By complying with their obligations, Member States would substantially contribute to reducing administrative burdens and SMEs would benefit from better enforcement of the existing Directive, a more level playing field and fairer competition. Improved administrative cooperation and effective and adequate inspections based on risk assessment would make inspections more effective and reduce costs for companies in non-risk sectors or situations and thus contribute to less burdensome controls. Furthermore, effective and adequate inspections, primarily based on regular risk assessment by the competent authorities, should be carried out in order to control and monitor compliance with the applicable rules. In order to reflect the different industrial relations systems and diversity of systems of control in the Member States, other actors and/or bodies may also monitor certain terms and conditions of employment of posted workers, such as the minimum rates of pay and working time. Enforcement: the proposal sets out provisions on the enforcement and defence of rights, which in itself concerns a fundamental right: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union confirms the right to effective remedy for everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the EU are not respected. Complaint mechanisms : the proposal sets out provisions on effective mechanisms for posted workers to lodge complaints directly or through designated third parties, such as trade unions, subject to their approval. Joint and several liabilities : the protection of workers rights is a matter of particular concern in subcontracting chains, which are particularly widespread in the construction sector in the EU. There is evidence that, in a number of cases, posted workers are exploited and left without payment of wages or part of the wages they are entitled to under the Directive 96/71/EC. The European Parliament has adopted several resolutions on this issue, calling upon the Commission to establish a legislative instrument on joint and several liability at EU level, in particular for long subcontracting chains (see However, a cautious approach is required in this respect in order to take due account of the variety of legal systems in place in the Member States, as well as the impact such a system may have on cross-border service provision within the Internal Market. The proposal contains specific provisions concerning contractors\u2019 obligations and (joint and several) liability with respect to compliance with the relevant terms and conditions of employment of posted workers by subcontractors. The focus is on preventive measures, combined with the possibility for Member States who so wish to implement more far-reaching systems of joint and several or chain liability. The provisions are limited to the construction sector, as defined by the list of activities included in the Annex to the Directive. Posting by temporary work agencies is included provided it is aimed at activities in the construction sector. However, Member States may, if they so wish, extend these provisions to other sectors. This balanced package of measures should reflect sufficiently the diversity of existing systems at national level, while at the same time avoiding adding unnecessary or unjustified administrative burden for companies. Joint and several liability is a mechanism of self-regulation between private actors and a far less restrictive and more proportionate system than possible alternative systems such as pure state intervention by inspections and sanctions. Cross-border enforcement of administrative fines and penalties : the absence of a common mutual recognition and enforcement instrument has been identified as causing major practical enforcement problems and difficulties. In a number of Member States the sanctions imposed are of a penal or criminal nature, whereas in others they are governed by administrative law, and a combination of the two can also be found. Existing EU instruments, such as Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA and the Brussels I Regulation, govern to a certain extent some of the fines and penalties imposed. With respect to fines and penalties of an administrative nature, which can be appealed to courts other than penal courts, similar instruments do not exist. Therefore, the proposal sets out a system for the cross-border enforcement of such administrative fines and penalties. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is expected to have implications for the EU budget: costs for grants (projects, seminars, exchange of good practice etc) of EUR 2 million as well as for the Expert Committee on the Posting of Workers of EUR 0. 264 million per year will be covered by PROGRESS (2013) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation (2014-2020); costs of EUR 0.5 million for an ex-post evaluation study in 2016 will be covered by the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; costs for human resources of EUR 0.232 million and other administrative expenditure (travel costs EUR 0.01 million; stakeholder conferences every second year EUR 0.36 million) will be covered under heading 5 of the Multiannual Financial Framework."}, {"response": "Postings of Workers entail labor mobility inside Europe. The proposal, governed by coherence & in the pursuit of uniform enforcement, aims to tackle abuses that have occurred due to legal provisions' muddled clarity. The Directive 96/71/EC's implementation & enforcement are to be enriched, ensuring guarantees for workers\u2019 rights' protection. The proposal focuses on more precise definitions, enhancing administrative cooperation, providing access to necessary information, improving control measures, and boosting inspections aided by risk assessment. Introducing better complaint mechanisms and joint liabilities with regards to subcontracting chains and cross-border enforcement are also contemplated.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers' interests to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market. Applicable as of 29th December 2005, the Regulation achieves this aim by creating an enforcement cooperation network between public enforcement authorities and thus increasing consumer confidence in taking up cross-border offers, and preventing sellers and suppliers from evading enforcement to the competitive detriment of law-abiding sellers and suppliers. The network established by the Regulation monitors and enforces legislation which protects consumers' interests. The legislation which falls into the scope of the network is listed in the Annex referred to in Article 3(a) of the Regulation. The amendment of the Annex will consist of the removal from the Annex of legislation which is not relevant for consumer protection cooperation and the updating of references to old legislation which is no longer in force by references to the current legislation in the field of consumer protection. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the proposed amending Regulation does not have significant economic, social and environmental impacts, an impact assessment is not necessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the overall goals of the proposed amending regulation are to ensure that Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws remains efficient and continues to guarantee that there is no discrimination between intra-EU and national transactions as to the effectiveness with which infringements are pursued by the competent national authorities. To achieve these goals, the proposed amending regulation has as its objective to update the contents of the Annex to the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation to reflect recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection. The proposal deletes obsolete legislation referred to in the Annex and replaces them with references to legislation currently in force.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein has been initiated by the Commission. The new Regulation was to have superseded the various acts incorporated in it. In the meantime the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. \u00b7 Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts). \u00b7 Article 291 of the TFEU allows the legislator to confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed (implementing acts). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE). CONTENT: Regulation (EC) No 338/97 contains provisions for which such a delegation of power or such a conferral of implementing powers would be opportune. It is therefore proposed to transform the codification of Regulation (EC) No 338/97 into a recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendments. The Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU in respect of the adoption of certain measures regulating trade in species of wild fauna and flora, of certain amendments to the Annexes to the Regulation and of additional measures to implement resolutions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (CITES), decisions or recommendations of the Standing Committee of the Convention and recommendations of the Convention Secretariat. When preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, the Commission should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. Lastly, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}, {"response": "33664"}]}

The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, exercising its prerogatives as an association committee in accordance with Rule 50 of the Parliament\u2019s Rules of Procedure, was also consulted for an opinion on the report. The committee recommended that Parliament\u2019s position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows: A sustainable industry policy strategy in the Union : the committee stressed the need to exclude unfair tenders comprising goods and/or services originating outside the Union. At the same time, reciprocity and fair conditions for the market access of Union industries should be ensured. Keep the principle of uniformity of the Common Commercial Policy (CCP): to prevent distortion of the internal market, and ensure efficient leverage through the CCP, Members stated that that Member States or their contracting authorities may restrict the access of third country goods and services to their tendering procedures only by measures provided for in the Regulation or by relevant Union law, and only after an investigation by the Commission has revealed the absence of substantial reciprocity by the third country concerned. Scope: the Regulation shall apply to the award of contracts and to the award of concessions for services provided for governmental purposes. It is proposed to exclude from the scope of the Regulation developing countries considered to be vulnerable due to a lack of diversification and insufficient integration within the international trading system as well as countries and potential GSP+ beneficiary countries. Rules of origin : the determination of the origin of a service should be made in line with the principles of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The provisions determining the rules of origin of services should prevent the circumvention of restrictions on access to the Union public procurement market through the establishment of \"letterbox\" companies. Procedure : Members wanted to ensure that the term 'calendar days' is consistently used throughout the proposal instead of 'days', 'calendar days' and 'working days'. They also shortened the length of the procedures throughout the proposal to provide faster protection, and made amendments intended to avoid an endless consultation procedure with third countries. Public contracts : in the performance of public contracts economic operators must comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions. A \u2018lack of substantial reciprocity\u2019 shall be presumed, where the non-observance of international labour law provisions listed in the Directive on public procurement. Assess impact and review the instrument : the report proposes incorporating a review clause, which obliges the Commission to look into the impact of the regulation, after it has come into force and being applied for a few years. Accordingly, when the Commission submits its second report, it shall also submit a legislative proposal for an amended Regulation or set out the reasons why, in its view, no changes are necessary. For the same reason, the report suggests limiting the application of any restrictive measures taken through an implementing act to up to 5 years so as to avoid these measures turning into a permanent closure of the market."}, {"response": "Party\t\t\t   /EPP/EPP to PD/PD/\n%\nECRE/ECRE\n%\nEGA/EGA\n%\nVerts/ALE/Verts/ALE\n%\nS&D/S&D\n%\nECR/ECR\n%\nRenew/ID\n%\nNI\t\t\t \t\n%\nYeas/General\t____%\nNays/General\t____%\nYeas/Left\t____%\nNays/Left\t____%\nYeas/Right\t____%\nNays/Right\t____%\nYeas/Consensus\t____%\nNays/Consensus\t____%"}]}
