PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. CONTENT: Article 19 of Council Regulation No 1311/2013 stipulates that in the event of the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or programmes under shared management for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum and Migration Fund and the Internal Security Fund, the MFF shall be revised in order to transfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure ceilings, allocations not used in 2014. The revision concerning the transfer of unused allocation for the year 2014 shall be adopted before 1 May 2015. It thus applies to programmes adopted after 1 January 2014 even when the relevant legal act was adopted by that time. Moreover, \u2018rules\u2019 covers not only the basic legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds concerned, but also implementing and delegated acts, to the extent to which they are a prerequisite for preparing or finalising the programmes. Consequently, this provision also applies to funds from the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative as the legal basis is the same as for programmes. It also applies to the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) as its commitments originate from the Structural Funds and are implemented under shared management. Article 19 also covers contributions from the ERDF to the cross-border and sea-basin programmes established under the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance as those amounts are part of national allocations defined in Article 91(2) of the ESI Funds\u2019 Common Provisions Regulation (CPR). It should be noted that Article 19 does not impose any constraints as to the profile of the transfer of allocations to subsequent years. Amounts concerned: as a result of such late adoption: This proposal seeks to amend Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring the commitment appropriations not used in 2014 to subsequent years for sub-heading 1b, heading 2 and heading 3. N.B. the Commission proposes to transfer the bulk of the allocations not used in 2014 to year 2015 in order to keep the pace of investments for growth and jobs, minimise differences of treatment with programmes adopted in 2014 and ensure equal treatment with programmes whose 2014 commitment tranche is carried-over in accordance with Article 13 of the Financial Regulation. An annex sets outs details of the amounts transferred by the Funds concerned and by year of transfer. IMPLICATIONS ON PAYMENTS: concerning the implications on payments in 2015, they will be covered within the voted budget for 2015. The first initial pre-financing that has not been paid in 2014 will have to be paid in 2015 together with the second pre-financing. However, the corresponding unused appropriations in 2014 have been used by transfers to reduce the backlog of unpaid bills from the previous period 2007-2013 and the reverse operation could be done, if need be, in 2015 to cover the pre-financings. The medium and longer term implications on interim payments of the transfer are more difficult to predict. The legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds contain provisions for the automatic decommitment of appropriations not used within a given deadline, which is of n+3 years for the ESI Funds and of n+2 years for the AMIF and the ISF. This could in principle result in a shift of payments from one year to another without this lowering the overall needs over the 2014-2020 period. On the other hand, the real pace of implementation will not be pre-determined by the transfer. For these reasons, the Commission does not propose to revise the payment ceilings. It will review the situation regularly in the light of implementation and make proposals if appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MFF Regulation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 545EP8, ECR%:0.871, EPP%:0.864, EFD/IDG%:0.375, Greens/EFA%:0.92, NI%:0.212, REG%:0.806, S&D%:0.901, The Left%:0.731, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the rapid take up of online content services and increasing use of portable devices, including across borders, means that Europeans today expect to use online content services from wherever they are in the Union (cross-border portability). However, when people travel in the EU, they frequently cannot enjoy such cross-border portability or can do so only to a limited extent. The absence of, or problems with, cross border portability of online content services in the EU results from the licensing practices of right holders and/or the commercial practices of service providers. Cross-border portability concerns online content services to which consumers have lawful access, or content that they purchased or rented online in their country of residence and to which they want to continue to have access when travelling in the EU. Consumer demand for the cross-border portability of online content services is substantial and expected to grow The Digital Single Market Strategy puts forward a range of initiatives with the objective of creating an internal market for digital content and services. This proposal is among the first of the initiatives under the strategy. The Commission considers that the proposal will have positive effects on competitiveness as it will help innovation in online content services and attract more consumers to them. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option, in addition to establishing a mechanism ensuring portability: (i) would impose an obligation on providers of online content services to ensure cross-border portability of such services and (ii) would establish that any provisions in contracts limiting cross-border portability would be unenforceable. This option would respond to consumers' expectations and the impact on industry is expected to be marginal because the portability of online content services does not extend the range of users of the service and as such does not challenge the territorial exclusivity of licences CONTENT: the proposed regulation introduces a common approach to ensuring that subscribers to online content services in the Union, which are delivered on a portable basis, can receive these services when temporarily present in another Member State (cross-border portability). Definitions : the proposal contains definitions that will need to be interpreted in a uniform manner in the EU: a \"subscriber\" is defined as a consumer who, on the basis of a contract for the provision of an online content service, may access and use such service in the Member State of his or her residence; a \"consumer\" is defined as any natural person who, in contracts covered by the regulation, is acting for purposes which are outside his or her trade, business, craft or profession. \"Online content service\" is covered by the proposal when: (i) the service is lawfully provided online in the Member State of residence; (ii) the service is provided on a portable basis; (iii) the service is an audiovisual media service within the meaning of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council or a service whose main feature is the provision of access to works, other subject matter or transmissions of broadcasting organisations. Two scenarios are covered as regards online content services: (i) services which are provided for payment of money (directly or indirectly); and (ii) services which are provided without payment of money provided that the subscriber's Member State of residence is verified by the service provider. if a subscriber receives an online content service without payment of money, the provider will only be obliged to enable the subscriber to enjoy cross-border portability if the provider verifies the subscriber's Member State of residence; if, however, a consumer just accepts the terms and conditions of a free of charge online content service but does not register on a website of such service (and hence the provider does not verify the Member State of residence of such a consumer), the service provider will not be obliged to provide cross-border portability for such service. Cross-border portability of online content services : the proposal requires the provider to enable a subscriber to use the online content service while the subscriber is temporarily present in another Member State. This applies to the same content, on the same range and number of devices and the same range of functionalities as offered in the Member State of residence. However, this obligation does not extend to any quality requirements applicable to the delivery of such service when the service is provided in the Member State of residence. Nevertheless, if the provider expressly agrees to guarantee certain quality of delivery to subscribers while temporarily present in other Member States, the provider shall be bound by such agreement. In addition, the draft regulation will oblige the provider to inform the subscriber of the quality of delivery of the online content service when accessed and used in a Member State other than the Member State of residence. Localisation: the proposal sets out a mechanism establishing the localisation of the service for purposes of portability: the provision as well as the access to and use of the service by a subscriber who is temporarily present in another Member State is deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. For the licensing of copyright and related rights, this means that the relevant copyright acts, which occur when the service is provided to consumers on a basis of crossborder portability, are deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. Contractual provisions : the proposal renders unenforceable: any contractual terms contrary to the cross-border portability obligation, in particular those which limit either consumer's possibilities as to the cross-border portability of his or her online content services or service provider's ability to deliver it; any contractual terms contrary to the legal mechanism which enables service providers to comply with the cross-border portability obligation. However, right holders may require that the service provider makes use of means in order to verify that the service is provided in conformity with the regulation. The draft regulation also provides that: (i) the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the Regulation shall be carried out in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2002/58/EC; (ii) the regulation shall also apply to any contracts concluded and rights acquired before the date of the application of the regulation if they are relevant for the provision of the service, the access to or the use of the service."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5390EP8, ECR%:0.786, EPP%:0.828, EFD/IDG%:0.646, Greens/EFA%:0.86, NI%:0.115, REG%:0.91, S&D%:0.88, The Left%:0.75, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU put in place a regulatory framework to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 40% as endorsed by the European Council in 2014, before the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The \u2018European Climate Law\u2019 has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to National targets and flexibilities The proposal updates the framework under which the Commission will set the new Member States\u2019 annual emission levels in the years 2023\u20132030 A review will be carried out in 2025 with a view to adjusting the annual emission allocations for the years of 2026 to 2030 in order to ensure that they are neither too lenient nor too stringent. The proposal sets national ESR targets based mainly on GDP per capita, in order to ensure fairness and cost effectiveness in effort distribution, while enabling though its flexibilities a cost-efficient achievement of such targets. Member States can decide to opt-out. This reserve could be triggered only once the requirements of the Climate Law are fulfilled, for the purpose of national compliance with ESR targets by transferring any unused LULUCF credits. They may use a limited a limited amount of credit generated under the LULUCF legislation for compliance in the ESR. The Commission also proposes a new voluntary reserve, the additional reserve, to help Member States reaching their individual targets, allowing them to use non used net removals generated in the period 2026-2030, subject to the condition that the Union 55% emission reduction target is reached in 2030 with a maximum contribution of net removals set at 225 MtCO2Eq, as required by the European Climate Law. Monitoring and reporting The proposal continues the Effort Sharing Regulation with the same monitoring and reporting obligations for Member States and management tasks for the Commission. The Commission will continue to be supported by the European Environment Agency in monitoring Member States\u2019 progress in meeting their obligations under the proposal. Budgetary implications The increase in the ESR targets will require additional measures at national level and Member States will need to revise and implement more stringent climate action strategies. Therefore, there is a need for capacity building support measures to be implemented throughout five years (2023-2027) allowing Member States to adjust to a more demanding framework.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were opened on 5 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 20 November 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andthe United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the United Arab Emirates when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of the United Arab Emirates to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that the United Arab Emirates may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also the United Arab Emirates remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and the United Arab Emirates reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of the United Arab Emirates to stay only in those Member States\u2019 European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 2353EP8, ECR%:0.6, EPP%:0.878, EFD/IDG%:0.354, Greens/EFA%:0.88, NI%:0.077, REG%:0.91, S&D%:0.895, The Left%:0.077, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he euro continues to be an attractive target for organised crime groups active in counterfeiting money, not only in Europe but also in other regions of the world. The international dimension of the threat with respect to euro counterfeiting calls for supranational coordination in facing it; through the Pericles programme, the Commission conducts such coordination by way of exchanges, training activities and technical assistance. Activities with the aim of promoting exchanges of information and staff, technical and scientific assistance and specialised training help significantly to protect Europe\u2019s single currency against counterfeiting and related fraud and therefore to attain a high and equivalent level of protection across the Union. Past support for such initiatives, through Council Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the \"Pericles\" programme), has made it possible to enhance the activities of the Union and the Member States in the field of the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. The objectives of the Pericles programme for both the period 2002-2006 and the period 2007-2013 were successfully achieved. The Treaty reflects concerns about the protection of the euro by providing for the measures necessary for its use as a single currency. As the legal basis for Pericles will expire at the end of 2013, its replacement should ensure the continuity of Union support for the activities carried out by the Commission and the Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: f our options have been considered: Option 1 : continue the programme with the same level of funding (baseline scenario). Option 2 : renew the Pericles programme with improved objectives and methodology, including in particular an increased maximum rate of co-financing. Option 3 : merge Pericles with other Commission programmes. Option 4 : discontinue the Pericles programme, and leave it for Member States to organise activities at national level for protecting the euro. The option to renew the programme with improved objectives and methodology is preferred (Option 2). This option has a budgetary allocation in real prices that remains similar to the current allocation (approximately one million euro per year). It adds flexibility in determining the amount of the grant by simplifying the determination of costs to be borne by Member States; it broadens the range of eligible activities by making it possible to finance the purchase of equipment to be used by specialised anti-counterfeiting agencies in for protecting the euro against counterfeiting; and it increases the rate of co-financing up to a maximum of 90 % of eligible costs, in duly justified cases. The higher rate of co-financing will particularly facilitate a more balanced geographic distribution of activities by offering wider scope for Member States to apply. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The application of the Pericles programme will be extended to the Member States that have not adopted the euro as their single currency, through a proposal for a parallel Regulation based on Article 352 TFEU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to establish a multiannual action programme \u2018Pericles 2020\u2019 to promote activities for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and related fraud. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The Programme shall contribute to increased transnational cooperation for the protection of the euro at Union level and internationally and to the greater effectiveness of these operations on the basis of best practices, common standards and joint specialised training. The general objective of the Programme shall be to prevent and combat counterfeiting and fraud thus enhancing the competitiveness of the European economy and securing the sustainability of public finances. The specific objective of the Programme shall be to protect the euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting and related fraud, by supporting and supplement the measures undertaken by the Member States and assisting the competent national and European authorities in their efforts to develop between themselves and with the European Commission a close and regular cooperation, also including third countries and international organisations. The Pericles programme concerns this specific sphere of activity of the European Commission and its cooperation with Member States\u2019 competent authorities, as well as with the other European institutions and bodies, more particularly through OLAF. Support from programmes designed to have a wider impact would be less effective in addressing such a specific issue and, in political terms, the EU institutions should demonstrate that they share a real determination to deal with this important aspect of EU policy and European identity. Accordingly, the Pericles programme will: target exclusively the protection of the euro, in the context of a long-term vision that is consistent with other EU objectives, on the basis of the priorities set each year for this specific field of expertise; allow the implementation of other EU programmes to focus on priorities other than the protection of the euro; fully take into account the results of the activities already co-financed in the past in this field, including in terms of targeted rules for beneficiaries and geographical balance; aim not only to have a direct impact on the situation of some Member States but to place strong emphasis on the EU dimension of the protection of Europe\u2019s single currency. The Pericles 2020 programme will make a substantial contribution to maintaining and further improving the high level of protection of the euro associated with the intensification of cross-border cooperation, exchanges and assistance. At the same time, overall savings will be achieved from the collectively organised activities and procurement, as compared to potential individual national initiatives. Priorities and implementation strategies are regularly discussed at meetings of the Euro Counterfeiting Experts Group (ECEG). The ECEG coordinates and is associated with the implementation of Pericles activities. In addition, the objectives have been renewed with special attention to setting Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) criteria. This will also help to ensure proper implementation and monitoring. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the overall budget is EUR 7 700 000 in current prices.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an environment marked by the emergence of new threats, such as hybrid and cyber-attacks, and the return of more conventional dangers, EU citizens and their political leaders agree that the EU should collectively take more responsibility for its security. The defence sector is largely fragmented across national borders , with considerable duplication, resulting in inefficiencies that prevent economies of scale. At the same time, the cost of defence equipment and in particular R&D costs have increased, while cooperation between Member States on investment in R&D and defence equipment has remained limited. In 2015, only 16% of defence equipment was procured through European collaborative procurement. In June 2017, the Commission adopted a communication launching the European Defence Fund consisting of 'windows' for research and for capability. The communication was accompanied by a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing the European defence industrial development programme under the capability window. A two-step approach was proposed, involving: an initial test period under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework during which a preparatory action on defence research supports collaborative defence research, while the proposed European defence industrial development programme shall co-finance collaborative development projects; and a dedicated fund under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework scaling up the funding for collaborative research in innovative defence products and technologies and for subsequent stages of the development cycle, including the development of prototypes. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - concerns the establishment of the European defence fund under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 with a view to fostering the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European defence industry and technological base and thus contributing to the strategic autonomy of the Union. The new fund shall promote cooperation between Member States and contribute to cost savings in the production of interoperable and advanced defence technologies and equipment. Its objective shall be: support collaborative research projects that could significantly boost the performance of future capabilities, aiming at maximising innovation and introducing new defence products and technologies, including disruptive ones; support collaborative development projects of defence products and technologies consistent with defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It shall contribute to greater efficiency of defence spending within the Union, achieving greater economies of scale, reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication and as such reducing the fragmentation of defence products and technologies throughout the Union. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation shall enable the Commission to set up a financing programme, implemented mainly through grants awarded following annual calls for proposals. Cross-border participation of SMEs and mid-cap companies shall be encouraged by offering higher financing rates. To be eligible, actions shall, in principle, be carried out in cooperation between at least three legal entities based in at least three different Member States and/or associated countries. Furthermore, the EU shall only co-finance the development of common prototypes if Member States commit themselves to buying the final product. Once assessed as eligible, a 'PESCO bonus', in the form of a higher funding rate, shall be granted to eligible permanent structured cooperation in defence projects. The fund shall also take into account defence activities implemented through the European peace facility, an off-budget instrument proposed outside the multi-annual financial framework. Proposed budget : the Fund shall have an overall budget of EUR 13 billion (at current prices) for the period 2021-2027, of which: Up to 5% of the financial envelope shall be devoted to support disruptive technologies for defence."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 8622EP8, ECR%:0.371, EPP%:0.81, EFD/IDG%:0.021, Greens/EFA%:0.08, NI%:0.038, REG%:0.806, S&D%:0.372, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates - a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges - are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5383EP7, ECR%:0.649, EPP%:0.773, EFD/IDG%:0.484, Greens/EFA%:0.825, NI%:0.212, REG%:0.759, S&D%:0.795, The Left%:0.514, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 493(1) and 498(1) of Regulation (EU) n\u00ba 575/2013 (\u2018CRR\u2019) exempt commodity dealers from large exposures requirements and from own funds requirements respectively. Both exemptions expire on 31 December 2017. This 'sunset clause' was originally included in the CRR in order to allow time for regulators to determine a prudential regulation adapted to the risk profile of commodity dealers. To this end, the CRR mandates the Commission to prepare reports by the end of 2015. On the basis of those reports, the Commission may decide to submit proposals to amend the CRR. The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) laid down in the CRR and Directive 2013/36/EC (\u2018the Capital Requirements Directive\u2019) is currently under review. The results will determine the appropriate prudential treatment of commodity dealers. The investment firms review is a complex project. The finalisation of the review and the adoption of new legislation that may be required in light of that review will be concluded only after 31 December 2017. It is therefore highly improbable that any legislation that may result from this review can be prepared, adopted and applied before the current exemptions expire. This has implications for commodity dealers: if no specific prudential framework that may result from the investment firm review would be in place by then, they would be subject to the full CRR/CRD requirements starting from 1 January 2018. This could force them to significantly increase the amount of own funds that they need to have in order to continue their activities and could therefore increase the related costs of performing those activities. To prevent this situation arising, the Commission feels it opportune to extend the existing exemptions laid down in the CRR, while taking into account the amount of time that will be necessary to conclude the investment firms review and to prepare, adopt and apply any legislation that may result from that review. CONTENT: the proposed provisions aim to extend the exemptions laid down in the CRR for commodity dealers from the large exposures and own funds requirements and accordingly, amend Regulation 575/2013. These exemptions apply until 31 December 2020 or the date of entry into force of any amendments, whichever is the earlier."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3257EP8, ECR%:0.886, EPP%:0.887, EFD/IDG%:0.104, Greens/EFA%:0.82, NI%:0.135, REG%:0.94, S&D%:0.895, The Left%:0.038, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

Recalling that the EU and Japan have been strategic partners since 2003, Members welcomed the conclusion of the draft Strategic Partnership Agreement, which provides a binding legal framework, strengthens EU-Japan bilateral relations and cooperation in more than 40 areas, as well as to address global issues requiring global cooperation such as climate change, migration, cyber threats, public health, transnational crime, peacebuilding operations, crisis and disaster management and the fight against terrorism. Parliament welcomed the reference to a parliamentary dimension in the agreement, which aims to strengthen the partnership through dialogue and cooperation on political issues, foreign and security policy and other types of sectoral cooperation. Human rights and fundamental freedoms Members reaffirmed the shared commitment to respect for human rights, democracy, fundamental freedoms, good governance and the rule of law, and common values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They called on the Union to enter into a dialogue with the Japanese government with a view to a moratorium on capital punishment and its possible abolition. They also highlighted the need for increased cooperation on women's rights. International and regional relations While welcoming the EU\u2019s new strategy to improve connectivity with Asia, Parliament called for, inter alia: - the expansion of EU-Japan bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation with South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States and China with a view to achieving and maintaining peace and stability in the region, peaceful coexistence on the Korean peninsula and the full, irreversible and verifiable denuclearisation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; - the development of synergies between Japan\u2019s Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and EU initiatives, including the EU Investment Plan and the extended EU Trans-European Transport Networks, in order to promote global cooperation in connectivity; - the strengthening of educational and cultural dialogue, university mobility programmes under Erasmus+, and public diplomacy with a view to promoting mutual understanding and cultural diversity; - intensifying cooperation in the field of sustainable energy, for example by developing low-emission forms of transport; - the suspension of whaling for scientific purposes and the lifting of Japan's reservations to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); - further exchange of good practices regarding illegal logging; - the exchange of information and cooperation to end cosmetics testing on animals in Japan. Sectoral cooperation Taking noted of the current low levels of people-to-people exchanges and of the linguistic barriers, Parliament suggested further investment to enhance citizen-to-citizen interaction, educational and cultural dialogue, academic mobility programmes under Erasmus+, and public diplomacy to promote mutual understanding and cultural diversity. It also called for: - Japan\u2019s ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, and intensified cooperation in the field of sustainable energy, e.g. in developing low-emission forms of transport; - the suspension of whaling for scientific purposes and the lifting of Japan's reservations to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); - further exchange of good practices regarding illegal logging; - the exchange of information and cooperation to end cosmetics testing on animals in Japan.
