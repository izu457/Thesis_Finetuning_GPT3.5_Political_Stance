PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the EU and Japan have a history of extensive political, economic and sectoral cooperation, which has evolved with time. Building on shared fundamental values, the EU established a Strategic Partnership with Japan in 2001. On 29 November 2012, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a framework agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Japan, of the other part.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth assigns a prominent role to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (set up by Regulation (EC) 294/2008) which contributes to a number of flagship initiatives. During the period 2014-2020, the EIT will contribute to the general objective of \" Horizon2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, by integrating the knowledge triangle of higher education, research and innovation. This integration takes place primarily via the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together organisations on a long-term basis around societal challenges. However, given its integrated, cross\u2013cutting nature, synergies will also be sought with other pillars, in particular the \"competitiveness\" pillar. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. On the other hand, the preparation of the proposal took account of the responses to the open consultations on the EIT. Views were expressed by the Member States and a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and civil society. It showed a strong support to the mission of the EIT to drive more and better cooperation between the worlds of academia, entrepreneurship, research and innovation. According to respondents: the EIT should play a distinctive role in 'Horizon 2020', the future EU Programme for Research and Innovation, and forge closer links with other European and national efforts; a majority of respondents praised the way in which the EIT ensures the participation of businesses in its work and urged the Institute to step up its outreach activities. Moreover, respondents considered business involvement as highly relevant for the future success of the EIT. Flexibility, clarity on rules and clear returns on investment is therefore fundamental in order to attract private sector participation; the proposal also relies on the external evaluation report in which the concept of integrating the knowledge triangle is regarded as highly relevant and the themes around which the EIT is structured are well-received; there is much support for the model which has been developed by the EIT, based around integrated networks of co-location centres. Respondents were also positive, and consistent, in their perspective that the value of the KICs was in acting as a catalyst to secure additional value from the activities which individual members already undertook. LEGAL BASIS: Article 173 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal will be implemented as centralised indirect management. The proposed amendments are based on several sources: lessons learnt during the initial period, the proposal for the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda, which builds on the proposal of the EIT Governing Board, the recommendations of the external evaluation report and Commission opinion on the evaluation, as well as the results of broad consultations with EIT stakeholders. The main amendments proposed are as follows: the financial contribution from Horizon 2020 to the EIT will be implemented in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in \"Horizon 2020\" . The EIT funding to the KICs will cover \"KIC added value activities\", however the KICs or their partner organisations may apply to other schemes under Horizon 2020 or European Union programmes in accordance with their respective rules and on equal footing with other applications; the EIT should directly engage with national and regional representatives and other stakeholders from across the innovation chain, generating beneficial effects on both sides. In order to render such dialogue and exchange more systematic, an EIT Stakeholder Forum should be organised, bringing together the wider community of stakeholders around crosscutting issues; the scope of the EIT contribution to the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (hereinafter referred to as KICs) should be defined and the origins of KICs' financial resources clarified; the composition of the EIT bodies should be simplified . The functioning of the EIT Governing Board should be streamlined and the respective roles and tasks of the Governing Board and the Director should be further clarified; new KICs , including their priority fields and the organisation and timing of the selection process, should be launched on the basis of modalities defined in the Strategic Innovation Agenda; cooperation on the organisation the monitoring and evaluations of the KICs between the Commission and the EIT is required to ensure coherence with overall EU level monitoring and evaluation system; in order to assure broader participation of organizations from different Members States in the KICs, the partner organizations should be established in at least three different Member States; the criteria and procedures for the financing, monitoring and evaluation of the activities of the KICs should be adopted by the EIT prior to launching the KIC selection process; the EIT Triennial Work Programme should take into account the Commission's opinion concerning the EIT's specific objectives, as defined in Horizon 2020, and its complementarities with European Union policies and instruments; the EIT, being under Horizon 2020, will be part of the mainstreaming of climate change expenditures as defined in Horizon 2020; the evaluation of the EIT should provide timely input to the evaluation of Horizon 2020 in 2017 and 2023; the Commission should strengthen its role in monitoring the implementation of specific aspects of EIT activities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: during the period 2014-2020 a financial contribution of EUR 3.182.230 million (current prices) for the EIT will be provided from Horizon 2020, the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5225EP7, ECR%:0.053, EPP%:0.795, EFD/IDG%:0.194, Greens/EFA%:0.772, NI%:0.273, REG%:0.807, S&D%:0.805, The Left%:0.371, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: i n the post-Lisbon era and after the abolition of the third pillar the area of justice develops dynamically in order to respond to all challenges. Legislative and policy measures as well as their coherent implementation are key tools. Funding can contribute to the development of this area through supporting legislation and policy-making and promoting their implementation. In accordance with the Communication on the EU Budget Review, a fresh look was taken at the existing funding instruments and delivery mechanisms to ensure clear focus on European added value and to cater for rationalisation and simplification of the funding mechanisms. In \u2018A Budget for Europe 2020\u2019, the Commission identified the need for a simpler and more transparent budget to overcome the problems that arise from the complexity of programme structures and the existence of multiple programmes. The area of Rights was mentioned as an example of the existing fragmentation, where action should be taken. Within this framework and aiming at simplification and rationalisation, the Rights and Citizenship Programme is the successor of three current programmes: Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Daphne III, The Sections \"Antidiscrimination and Diversity\" and \"Gender Equality\" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS). The merge of these programmes will allow for a comprehensive funding approach in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: one impact assessment was carried out concerning the future funding activities for the whole area of justice, rights and equality, which currently comprises six programmes ( Civil Justice Programme, the Criminal Justice Programme, the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Daphne III Programme, the Drug Prevention and Information Programme and the sections \"Antidiscrimination and Diversity\" and \"Gender Equality\" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity ( PROGRESS )). The impact assessment has considered three options: Option A: to maintain six programmes and to address some of the identified problems through changes in the internal management of the programmes.; Option B: to maintain all measures of option A and additionally to merge the current six programmes into two programmes. This option would allow for flexibility in the use of funds and in addressing annual policy priorities. It would achieve increased simplification (both for the beneficiaries and the administration) and efficiency of the programmes, since significantly fewer procedures would be needed. The effectiveness of the programmes would also be improved as the fragmentation and dilution of funds would be addressed better within two programmes. Human resources could be freed, since fewer procedures would reduce the administrative burden and they would be allocated to activities improving the effectiveness of the programmes (dissemination of results, monitoring, providing information, etc). Option C: to implement only one programme. This option addresses all problems caused by the multiple legal instruments and by the increased administrative burden of managing multiple programmes. However, due to legal constraints the scope of this programme would not be able to cover the funding needs of all policy areas. A choice would have to be made between the area of justice and the area of rights and citizenship. Although this solution can deliver maximum impact in terms of management, however it would not be possible to address sufficiently the policy priorities and needs of the whole policy area. Resulting from the analysis and comparison of the options, the preferred option is the implementation of two programmes which would cover the funding needs of all policy areas (option B). In comparison to the status quo option B presents clear advantages and no disadvantage. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(1) and (2), Article 82(1) and Article 84 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission proposes to establish a new European Union programme on Justice 2014-2020. General objective : the general objective of the Programme shall be to contribute to the creation of a European area of justice by promoting judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. To achieve the general objective, the Programme shall have the following specific objectives: to promote effective, comprehensive and consistent application of Union legislation in the areas of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters; to facilitate access to justice; to prevent and reduce drug demand and supply. The proposal states that the indicator to measure the achievement of this objective shall be, inter alia, the number of cases of trans-border cooperation. The Programme shall aim to promote equality between women and men and combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in all its activities. Actions financed : the Programme shall finance inter alia the following types of actions: analytical activities , such as collection of data and statistics; development of common methodologies and, where appropriate, indicators or benchmarks; studies, researches, analyses and surveys; evaluations and impact assessments; training activities , such as staff exchanges, workshops, seminars, train-the-trainers events; mutual learning, cooperation, awareness raising and dissemination activities , such as identification of, and exchanges on, good practices, innovative approaches and experiences, organisation of peer review and mutual learning; support for main actors , such as support for Member States when implementing Union law and policies; support for key European level networks whose activities are linked to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme; funding of experts' networks; funding of European level observatories. European added value : the Commission shall ensure that the actions selected for funding are intended to produce results with European added value and shall monitor whether European added value was actually achieved through the final results of the actions financed by the Programme. Implementation : in implementing this Regulation the Commission will establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. The Programme can make use of all financial instruments foreseen in the Financial Regulation. The Commission may use, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, an existing executive agency for the implementation of the programme, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes. The programme may share resources with other Union instruments, in particular the Rights and Citizens Programme, in order to implement actions meeting the objectives of both programmes. Participation of the programme : ac cess to the Programme shall be open to all public and/or private bodies and entities legally established in: (a) Member States; (b) EFTA countries which are party to the EEA Agreement; (c) accession countries, candidate countries and potential candidates;(d) Denmark, on the basis of an international agreement. Under the Programme, the Commission may cooperate with international organisations active in the areas covered by the Programme, such as the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Access to the Programme shall be open to those international organisations. Monitoring and evaluation : the Commission shall monitor the Programme regularly. The monitoring will also provide a means of assessing the way in which gender equality and anti-discrimination issues have been addressed across the programme\u2019s activities. Where relevant, indicators should be disaggregated by sex, age and disability. The Commission shall provide the European Parliament and the Council with: (a) an interim evaluation report, by mid-2018 at the latest; (b) an ex-post evaluation report. Complementarity : the Commission shall ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with other Union instruments, inter alia, with the Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Instrument for financial support for police cooperation, crime prevention and the fight against cross-border, serious and organised crime, the Health for Growth Programme, the Erasmus for all Programme, the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme and the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. CONTENT: the Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/352 which establishes a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports. It is proposed that the new transitional provision shall provide Member States with the option to allow managing bodies of a port or competent authorities to decide whether to:  waive (condone, i.e. not require the payment at all); or suspend (freeze or put on hold the payment for a certain time period); or reduce (decrease the payment); or defer (require the payment at a later point in time) the payment of the port infrastructure charges. As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. This new provision also stipulates that the managing body of a port or the competent authority shall ensure that port users and the representatives or associations of port users are informed accordingly.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lays down the list of third countries whose national must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (\u201cnegative list\u201d) and those whose national are exempt from that requirement (\u201cpositive list\u201d). The determination of those third countries or territories whose citizens are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating, among other things, to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the European Union's external relations with third countries or territories. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity, and particular attention is paid to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries or territories concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries or territories, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed regularly. The present review of the Regulation aims at: ensure that the composition of the lists of third countries and territories complies with the criteria set out in recital 5 of the Regulation, in particular as regards the illegal immigration and public policy criteria and the external relations criterion, and transferring countries from one annex to another as appropriate; ensure that, in accordance with Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU, the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country or territory citizen is to be subject to or exempt from the visa requirement. As a result, a new modified version of Regulation (EC) No 239/2001 is proposed in order to include a certain number of states in the Regulation\u2019s positive and negative lists. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU. CONTENT: in accordance with the approach followed in the context of previous amendments to Regulation (EC) No. 539/2001, it is proposed to: transfer Taiwan to the positive list: despite the fact that the EU does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state and has no diplomatic or formal relations with Taiwan, the EU has developed regular contacts and cooperation in a number of areas with the Taiwanese authorities. As a result, the EU is the largest foreign investor in Taiwan. Upon analysis, it became apparent that transferring Taiwan to the positive list would reinforce regional coherence as the EU grants visa free regime to other countries and entities of the region. As regards migration, the risk of illegal immigration from Taiwan is very low On that basis, imposing a visa requirement on the nationals of Taiwan is no longer justified; transfer of the Northern Mariana Islands to the positive list : the Northern Mariana Islands are a commonwealth in political union with the United States of America, and the head of the state of Northern Mariana is the president of the United States. The citizens of the Islands have US passports. Following from the above information, the reference to the Northern Mariana Islands should be deleted from Annex I. This will entail that the citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands, as US nationals, enjoy visa-free travel. Lastly, it should be noted that the draft Regulation proposes a new Part 4 under Annex II : this is entitled \u201cEntities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as States by at least one Member State,\u201d and the list is comprised of Taiwan.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an environment marked by the emergence of new threats, such as hybrid and cyber-attacks, and the return of more conventional dangers, EU citizens and their political leaders agree that the EU should collectively take more responsibility for its security. The defence sector is largely fragmented across national borders , with considerable duplication, resulting in inefficiencies that prevent economies of scale. At the same time, the cost of defence equipment and in particular R&D costs have increased, while cooperation between Member States on investment in R&D and defence equipment has remained limited. In 2015, only 16% of defence equipment was procured through European collaborative procurement. In June 2017, the Commission adopted a communication launching the European Defence Fund consisting of 'windows' for research and for capability. The communication was accompanied by a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing the European defence industrial development programme under the capability window. A two-step approach was proposed, involving: an initial test period under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework during which a preparatory action on defence research supports collaborative defence research, while the proposed European defence industrial development programme shall co-finance collaborative development projects; and a dedicated fund under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework scaling up the funding for collaborative research in innovative defence products and technologies and for subsequent stages of the development cycle, including the development of prototypes. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - concerns the establishment of the European defence fund under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 with a view to fostering the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European defence industry and technological base and thus contributing to the strategic autonomy of the Union. The new fund shall promote cooperation between Member States and contribute to cost savings in the production of interoperable and advanced defence technologies and equipment. Its objective shall be: support collaborative research projects that could significantly boost the performance of future capabilities, aiming at maximising innovation and introducing new defence products and technologies, including disruptive ones; support collaborative development projects of defence products and technologies consistent with defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It shall contribute to greater efficiency of defence spending within the Union, achieving greater economies of scale, reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication and as such reducing the fragmentation of defence products and technologies throughout the Union. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation shall enable the Commission to set up a financing programme, implemented mainly through grants awarded following annual calls for proposals. Cross-border participation of SMEs and mid-cap companies shall be encouraged by offering higher financing rates. To be eligible, actions shall, in principle, be carried out in cooperation between at least three legal entities based in at least three different Member States and/or associated countries. Furthermore, the EU shall only co-finance the development of common prototypes if Member States commit themselves to buying the final product. Once assessed as eligible, a 'PESCO bonus', in the form of a higher funding rate, shall be granted to eligible permanent structured cooperation in defence projects. The fund shall also take into account defence activities implemented through the European peace facility, an off-budget instrument proposed outside the multi-annual financial framework. Proposed budget : the Fund shall have an overall budget of EUR 13 billion (at current prices) for the period 2021-2027, of which: Up to 5% of the financial envelope shall be devoted to support disruptive technologies for defence."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 8622EP8, ECR%:0.371, EPP%:0.81, EFD/IDG%:0.021, Greens/EFA%:0.08, NI%:0.038, REG%:0.806, S&D%:0.372, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down common rules for the basic payment scheme and related payments. It seeks to better target support to certain actions, areas or beneficiaries as well as to pave the way for convergence of the level of support within and across Member States. The regulation also includes a section on coupled support. (1) A single scheme across the EU, the basic payment scheme, replaces the Single Payment Scheme and the Single Area Payment Scheme as from 2014. The scheme will operate on the basis of payment entitlements allocated at national or regional level to all farmers according to their eligible hectares in the first year of application. (2) The definition of active farmer further enhances targeting on farmers genuinely engaged in agricultural activities, and thus legitimizes support. In addition, the progressive reduction and capping of support for large beneficiaries is foreseen while taking due account of employment. (3) The following payments are also provided: \u00b7 a payment (30% of annual national ceiling) for farmers following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment: crop diversification, maintenance of permanent pastures and ecological focus areas. Organic farming automatically benefits from this payment, while farmers in Natura 2000 areas will have to comply with the relevant requirements to the extent that they are consistent with the Natura 2000 legislation; \u00b7 a voluntary payment (up to 5% of annual national ceiling) for farmers in areas facing specific natural constraints (areas delimited in the same manner as for rural development purposes); this payment recognizes the need for income support to maintain presence in areas facing specific natural constraints and complements existing support under rural development; \u00b7 a payment (up to 2% of annual national ceiling) for young farmers in their installation, which may be complemented by setting up aid under rural development. At the same time, the Regulation: lays down a simplified scheme for small farmers (up to 10% of annual national ceiling), who may thus receive a lump sum payment replacing all direct payments and producing administrative simplification with an easing of such farmers' obligations related to greening, cross compliance and controls; provides a voluntary coupled support scheme for specific types of farming or specific agricultural systems which are experiencing certain difficulties and which are particularly important for economic and/or social reasons; support is provided to the extent necessary to maintain current levels of production (up to 5% of annual national ceiling with the possibility to go beyond this in particular cases); maintain the possibility for Complementary National Direct Payments for Bulgaria and Romania and includes a specific payment for cotton. In terms of simplification, the new direct payments system will be based on a single type of payment entitlements and streamline transfer rules, thereby simplifying its management. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5199EP7, ECR%:0.14, EPP%:0.81, EFD/IDG%:0.097, Greens/EFA%:0.105, NI%:0.333, REG%:0.687, S&D%:0.682, The Left%:0.029, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, maritime safety and security, search and rescue operations, fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The objective of this initiative is to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency should therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coastguard functions to increase maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. CONTENT: this legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes proposals for a Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency. The proposal stipulates that the EMSA shall, in cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Fisheries Control Agency, support national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at international level by: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the agencies, in accordance with their respective legal bases and without prejudice to the ownership of data by Member States; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building by elaborating guidelines , recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhancing the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative requires an increase in the EU contribution to EMSA of around EUR 22 million per year (that is around EUR 87 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 17 TA staff. This is operational expenditure for around EUR 81 million mainly to cover provision of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) services for border control surveillance (EUR 67 million) and satellite aerial surveillance (SAT-AIS) and Satcom data and services to increase the surveillance capability of the 3 agencies and national authorities to strengthen as a primary objective the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3663EP8, ECR%:0.6, EPP%:0.932, EFD/IDG%:0.375, Greens/EFA%:0.96, NI%:0.154, REG%:0.985, S&D%:0.932, The Left%:0.019, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}
