PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid \"in beneficiary countries\", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the EIDHR and on the parallel proposal amending the DCI."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 2378EP7, ECR%:0.789, EPP%:0.842, EFD/IDG%:0.548, Greens/EFA%:0.895, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.867, S&D%:0.8, The Left%:0.057, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the consequences of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for farmers and rural businesses are unprecedented. Mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments have led to economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances. CONTENT: the proposal includes limited and targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 providing exceptional and temporary support to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, which are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Exceptional temporary support Support under this measure shall consist of temporary emergency aid to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis to ensure the continuity of their activities. It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 1353EP9, ECR%:1.016, EPP%:0.973, EFD/IDG%:0.836, Greens/EFA%:0.919, NI%:0.649, REG%:0.935, S&D%:0.929, The Left%:0.927, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUD: in a crisis where EUR 4 588.9 billion of taxpayer money was committed to support banks between October 2008 and October 2009 and where such aid accounted for 39% of EU 27 GDP in 2009, all components of the financial system need to be improved. Robust audit is key to re-establishing trust and market confidence. It contributes to investor protection by providing easily accessible, cost-effective and trustworthy information about the financial statements of companies. It also potentially reduces the cost of capital for audited companies by ensuring more transparency and reliability of financial statements. It is also important to stress that auditors are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits. EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit through Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts. However, the high degree of concentration in audit market and the multitude of approval procedures necessary to provide cross-border statutory audits prevent small and medium-sized audit firms from benefiting from the internal market. The following problems are examined: \u00a7  a high level of administrative burden resulting from fragmented national regulation; \u00a7  the provision of cross-border statutory audits is allowed only if an auditor passes an aptitude test and gets approved and registered in every Member State; \u00a7  a lack of common standards across the EU on audit practice, independence, internal control of audit firms; \u00a7  auditing standards do not take into account the size of the audited companies, in particular of SMEs; \u00a7  associated problems regarding supervision of non-PIEs. This proposal on amending Directive 2006/43/EC aims to improve the internal market on statutory audits. It will coexist with a proposal for a regulation on the specific requirements on the statutory audit of public-interest entities. The two proposals are part of the ongoing regulatory reform in various domains of the financial sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment concluded that the best options to improve the existing situation would be: \u00a7  facilitation of the cross-border recognition of audit providers' competence; \u00a7  streamlining of the standards on audit practice, independence and internal control of audit firms across the Union; \u00a7  adaptation of audit standards to the size of the audited entity by requesting Member States to ensure that a proportionate and simplified audit for SMEs is possible. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal contains amendments to the provisions on the approval and registration of auditors and audit firms, on the existing principles in Directive 2006/43/EC regarding professional ethics, professional secrecy, independence and reporting as well as the associated supervision rules that remain applicable for the audit of non-public-interest entities (non- PIEs). The main modifications to the Directive are: Articulation between the Directive and an additional legal instrument on specific requirements for the statutory audit of PIEs : the proposal deals with the applicability of the amended Directive to the statutory audit of PIEs. Certain provisions apply to statutory auditors and audit firms, irrespective of the type of audited entity. However, for the rest of the Articles of the Directive, the situation is different: clauses on independence and objectivity, audit fees, audit reporting, quality assurance, investigations and penalties would not apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. On these specific issues more detailed rules would be enacted in the Regulation. Definition of \"statutory audit\" in order to take account of the new Accountancy Directive : the new definition will continue to cover the instances where different Union legal texts impose an obligation on some undertakings to have their financial statements audited, depending on their legal form or on their activity. In order to guarantee the \u201cunicity\u201d of audit, the definition of \"statutory audit\" should also cover situations where Member States decide to impose an obligation on small undertakings to have their financial statements audited. Lastly, where a small undertaking decides voluntarily to have its financial statements audited, such audit should also be considered a statutory audit. Modification of the ownership rules : currently, the Directive requires that a majority of the voting rights in an audit firm is held by licensed accountant practitioners. This requirement is no longer stipulated in the proposed amendment and Member States are forbidden to require that a minimum of capital or of voting rights in an audit firm is held by statutory auditors or audit firms. However, the proposal maintains the existing requirement that a majority of the members of the administrative or management body of the audit firm are audit firms or statutory auditors. Passport for audit firms : the proposal for an amended Directive would allow audit firms to provide statutory audits in Member States other than the Member State in which they have been approved, provided that the key audit partner leading the audit is approved as an auditor in the Member State concerned. However, once approval is obtained in the home Member State, the host Member State may require some form of registration of audit firms from other Member States. Passport for statutory auditors and \"softening\" the conditions for a statutory auditor to be approved in a different Member State : the proposed modifications regarding the approval of statutory auditors from other Member States are aligned with the provisions of the Directive 2005/36 on the recognition of professional qualifications. \u00a7  The proposal would allow statutory auditors to provide cross-border statutory audit services on a temporary or occasional basis. The conditions set out in the Professional Qualifications Directive would apply, notably the obligation to communicate the intention to provide the services in question to the relevant competent authority. \u00a7  A Member State will be able to offer the statutory auditor who is approved in another Member State the choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test, if such auditor wants to set up a permanent establishment in that Member State. The test should be aimed at assessing the statutory auditor's knowledge of the laws and regulations of that Member State that are relevant for the carrying out of the statutory audit. \u00a7  During the adaptation period, which should be offered to the applicant as an alternative to the aptitude test, the statutory auditor would be allowed to conduct statutory audit in the Member State, other than the one in which he or she is approved, under the supervision of a local auditor. The length of the adaptation period is three years. Requirements to competent authorities to cooperate regarding educational requirements and aptitude test : in order to ensure more convergence of the educational qualifications of auditors at Union level, the competent national authorities in charge of the public oversight for statutory auditors must cooperate. Cooperation at Union level is also necessary to harmonise the requirements of the aptitude test. Auditing standards and audit reporting : the proposal requires Member States to ensure that statutory auditors and audit firms carry out audits in accordance with the international auditing standards. New rules regarding competent authorities : currently, the Directive requires Member States to organise a system of public oversight for statutory auditors and audit firms. The new amendment states that the competent authority responsible for public oversight will be a public authority that will be also responsible for approval, registration and quality assurance. The competent authority responsible for the public oversight may delegate some of its tasks to other authorities or bodies with regard to the approval and registration of the statutory auditors and audit firms. Such delegation must be subject to several conditions and the body that bears the ultimate responsibility is the competent authority. Prohibition of contractual clauses: the proposal prohibits clauses according to which a third party suggests, recommends or requires the audited entity to appoint a specific statutory auditor or audit firm. Special rules for the statutory audit of small and medium-sized undertakings : following the recent Commission proposal, small undertakings would no longer be required by EU law to have their financial statements audited, although Member States may still require it. However, the requirement will continue to apply to medium-sized undertakings. When medium-sized undertakings are audited pursuant to EU law, the amended Directive requires Member States to ensure that the way in which the auditing standards are applied are adapted to the dimension and scale of those undertakings. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the European Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6523EP7, ECR%:0.684, EPP%:0.802, EFD/IDG%:0.29, Greens/EFA%:0.018, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.771, S&D%:0.005, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: information society services and especially intermediary services have become an important part of the EU\u2019s economy and daily life of Union citizens. Twenty years after the adoption of the existing legal framework applicable to such services laid down in e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, new and innovative business models and services, such as online social networks and marketplaces, have allowed business users and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. A majority of EU citizens now use those services on a daily basis. However, the digital transformation and increased use of those services has also resulted in new risks and challenges, both for individual users and for society as a whole. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more specifically, intermediary services). It aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the EU, by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member States have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. The proposed regulation lays down harmonised rules on the provision of intermediary services in the internal market. In particular, it establishes: - a framework for the conditional exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services; - rules on specific due diligence obligations tailored to certain specific categories of providers of intermediary services; - rules on the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, including as regards the cooperation of and coordination between the competent authorities. This proposal should apply to intermediary services provided to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or residence in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment of the providers of those services. Specific provisions The proposal lays down: - measures to counter illegal goods, services or content online, such as a mechanism for users to flag such content and for platforms to cooperate with \u2018trusted flaggers\u2019; - new obligations on traceability of business users in online marketplaces, to help identify sellers of illegal goods; - effective safeguards for users, including the possibility to challenge platforms\u2019 content moderation decisions; - transparency measures for online platforms on a variety of issues, including on the algorithms used for recommendations; - obligations for very large platforms to prevent the misuse of their systems by taking risk-based action and by independent audits of their risk management systems; - access for researchers to key data of the largest platforms, in order to understand how online risks evolve; - oversight structures to address the complexity of the online space: EU countries will have the primary role, supported by a new European Board for Digital Services; for very large platforms, enhanced supervision and enforcement by the Commission.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Opening of tariff quotas : the Union negotiated tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The proposal aims therefore to open annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. Management : the Commission: should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adoption of amendments to this Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision concluding an agreement with one or more third countries; should adopt, by means of implementing acts, rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this Regulation and, as appropriate, provisions: (a) guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; (b) relating to the recognition of the document allowing the guarantees referred to in point (a) to be verified; and (c) on the issue of import licences and their period of validity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 441EP8, ECR%:0.871, EPP%:0.946, EFD/IDG%:0.438, Greens/EFA%:0.98, NI%:0.173, REG%:0.955, S&D%:0.942, The Left%:0.788, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: the scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008, carried out in 2011, stated that the cod plan has not achieved its objectives and that they are unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Furthermore, the report revealed that there are flaws in the design of the Regulation and problems with its implementation. The Commission is proposing an amendment to the Regulation in the light of this advice and of the opinions received from Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and the Member States. The proposal for the amendment of the Regulation does not cover all the problems identified since this amendment is intended as an interim solution pending the development and implementation of a mixed-fishery plan for North Sea fisheries as anticipated in the reform. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal was drawn up on the basis of consultations with the Member States and stakeholders. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENTS: the main legal action is as far as possible to improve and clarify the provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 that were identified in the evaluation as problematic, in particular: \u00b7  the changes to Article 4 (Calculation of fishing effort) aim at closing the unintended possibility for Member States to deploy higher levels of effort than the plan was meant to allow simply by changing the methods used for the calculation of effort when establishing the baselines and when calculating usage; \u00b7  Article 9 (Special procedure for setting TACs) defines a procedure for TAC setting in the absence of the necessary information to apply Article 7 or 8. Instead of automatic reductions of 25% it is proposed to take a case-by-case, and therefore a more flexible, approach though remaining firmly based on available scientific advice; \u00b7  instead of exempting groups of vessels specified by each Member State, exemptions are now based on criteria that would be generally applicable for any vessels that meet them, regardless of the Member State to which they belong. The amended Article also avoids the need for constant adjustments of the baseline by Council; \u00b7  transitional measures will ensure that vessels groups already excluded will be subject to the criteria in force at the time of exclusion; \u00b7  vessels involved in the fully documented fishery trials , where all catches are counted against quota, are exempted from fishing effort regime; \u00b7  a new proposal foresees the possibility for the Council to decide not to apply further fishing effort reductions, once the fishing-effort ceiling has been reduced for four consecutive years; \u00b7  it is now made clear that the condition that cod catch are less than 5 % of the total refers to the catch composition over the management period, not per trip; \u00b7  in Article 14, the Member State obligation to address the discard issue is strengthened since it is not the case under the current ruling, and level of control and monitoring is specified according to risk-based management; \u00b7  the Committee procedure is brought into line with the rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the present proposal takes into account recent legislative and political developments regarding the Financial Regulation (FR). For the sake of legal clarity and in order to facilitate the negotiations of the European Parliament and the Council, it merges and replaces two earlier Commission proposals on the revision of the FR in a single text and under a standard legislative format (no recast). These two earlier proposals concerned on the one hand, the triennial revision of the Financial Regulation and, on the other hand, the revision of the FR to align it with the Lisbon Treaty , including the obligations of Member States concerning internal control and audit and their resulting responsibilities in shared management. Therefore, these two earlier proposals are withdrawn. Additionally, the proposal also incorporates the changes to the FR due to the adoption of the Regulation No 1081/2010 regarding the creation of the European External Action Service ('EEAS'). LEGAL BASE AND PROCEDURE: since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the FR is to be revised in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure in Article 322 TFEU. In order to allow the legislative authority to have a global view of the proposed modifications, the Implementing Rules of the Financial Regulation (IR) are presented, in a Commission Staff working document, together with the FR in a single package. The IR, which contains more detailed provisions complementing the FR, will be adopted under the delegated powers of the Commission according to Article 290 TFEU. The present proposal does not contain any change of substance compared to the two earlier proposals , which are: (i) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Union; (ii) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. As a consequence, the working document of the Commission services concerning the Implementing Rules to the FR, which has been put forward by the Commission together with the triennial revision, remains entirely valid. CONTENT: in 2011 more than EUR 126 billion is planned for allocation to EU policies benefiting the Union and its citizens. In the current economic context it is even more important that the delivery mechanisms of the budget operate in the most efficient way and facilitate the implementation of EU policies, while securing sound treatment of European taxpayers' money. In particular, it is important that these mechanisms are: (i) simple and transparent (especially to final recipients of EU funds); (ii) provide the possibility for leverage of non-EU budget resources and at the same time (iii) strengthen the Commission's accountability for implementation of the budget. (1) Need for a reform : reform is necessary with a view to adapting the financial rules to the new requirements of budget implementation (co-financing with other donors, specific financial instruments, PPPs) or where the basic principles create disproportionate workload (interests on pre-financing) or may unduly impede efficiency (prohibition of budget implementation through private sector bodies). The award of small grants and contracts also needs to be facilitated. Furthermore, the new procedure applicable to the IR, as set out in the Lisbon Treaty, should lead to a new articulation between the FR and the IR, imposing a complete review of the whole set of financial rules. In this context, the Commission has based its proposal on the following objectives: \u00b7 to introduce more flexibility in the application of budgetary principles, which should better suit operational needs and alleviate unnecessary administrative burden for recipients of Union funds; \u00b7 to streamline relations with implementing partners to which the Commission entrusts the management of programmes or part of programming actions (projects), in particular taking account of the nature of the implementing partner (Member States, agencies, EIB, public and private operators, etc.) and the financial risks entailed (proportionality); \u00b7 to shift the regime of grants from a real-cost based management (inputs) towards a performance-based scheme (outputs), in order to better target policy objectives and achieve significant simplification of procedural and documentary requirements for the benefit of beneficiaries, and facilitate the use of lump sums; \u00b7 to ensure sound financial management while leaving significant room for manoeuvre for Authorising Officers so that they can adapt the means to their operational constraints and the financial risks they are faced with; \u00b7 to modernise the system of risk management and control measures so as to make them more proportional to the probability of errors and to the cost involved. (2) Alignment with the Lisbon Treaty : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union \u2013 (TFEU), which entered into force on December 1, 2009, makes important changes concerning budgetary and financial issues. These changes should be translated in the Financial Regulation and concern in particular: \u00b7 the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the Treaty, and its link to annual budgetary procedure: in this regard, as a consequence of the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the TFEU, some provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management should be introduced in the Financial Regulation; \u00b7 the new annual budgetary procedure and the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, which have an impact on the provisions relating to transfers and the provisional twelfths; \u00b7 the new provisions introduced in Article 317 TFEU concerning the control and audit obligations of the Member States in the implementation of the budget, together with Point 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. The proposal also allows for the streamlining of the Financial Regulation in line with the Lisbon Treaty, through both technical adaptations and the deletion of obsolete provisions. TIMETABLE: the present revision of the FR occurs while preparation for the post-2013 programmes is also under way. It is important that all the actors concerned in the legislative process maintain an ambitious timetable for the present revision. They should aim at an agreement on the package (Financial Regulation and Implementing Rules) so that it could enter into application on 1 January 2012."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3254EP7, ECR%:0.596, EPP%:0.813, EFD/IDG%:0.194, Greens/EFA%:0.754, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.723, S&D%:0.779, The Left%:0.029, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the international maritime safety conventions require flag States to ensure that the equipment carried on board ships complies with certain safety requirements as regards design, construction and performance, and to issue the relevant certificates. To that end, detailed performance and testing standards for certain types of marine equipment have been developed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and by the international and European standardisation bodies. The international instruments leave a significant margin of discretion to the flag administrations . Back in 1995, the Commission clearly identified the problems encountered in the Internal Market as a result of this state of affairs and in the absence of EU harmonisation in the marine equipment sector. Council Directive 96/98/EC on marine equipment (MED) thus laid down common rules to eliminate differences in the implementation of international standards by means of a clearly identified set of requirements and uniform certification procedures. Experience has shown that it is necessary to take additional measures in order to enhance the implementation and enforcement mechanisms of the said Directive and simplify the regulatory environment while guaranteeing that IMO requirements are applied and implemented in a harmonised way across the Union. Decision No 768/2008 (New Legislative Framework) constitutes a general framework of a horizontal nature for future legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products and a reference text for existing legislation. This general framework provides appropriate solutions to the problems identified in the implementation of Directive 96/98/EC. It is therefore necessary to incorporate the definitions and reference provisions of Decision No 768/2008 into this Directive by making the adaptations which are required by the specific features of the marine equipment sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on two alternatives to the baseline (statu quo) scenario, namely: (i) a maximum alignment with the new legislative framework; and (ii) conditional alignment, allowing for a number of MED-specific measures in order to cater for the sector's particular features. The analysis showed that conditional alignment was the most effective and least burdensome solution and, at the same time, it had the most positive overall economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish requirements for marine equipment to meet the safety standards laid down in the applicable international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, in order to ensure that equipment which complies with these requirements can circulate unimpeded within the Internal Market and be placed on board ships flying the flag of any Member State . Scope : the scope of the Directive is defined by reference to equipment which is (a) due to be installed on board a ship flying the flag of a Member State , and (b) for which the approval of the flag State is required by the international conventions. Requirements for marine equipment : these are defined by reference to the international conventions and instruments. As required by these, demonstration of compliance is confined to the specific applicable testing standards. Given the need to ensure continued consistency with the international regulatory framework, these requirements and standards must apply in their up-to-date version. Responsibility : the proposal provides that the flag State has the responsibility to ensure that only equipment which has been duly approved in accordance with the then applicable requirements of the international instruments is placed on board ships flying its flag. In addition, the proposed Directive: provides the basis for the free movement of marine equipment within the EU, based on the concept of mutual recognition between Member States of equipment complying with the requirements laid down in the Directive; reflects the priority given to the international regulation of maritime safety, consistent with the global nature of shipping; governs the particular case of the transfer of a ship to a Member State's register based on the principle of compliance with the Directive\u2019s requirements; established rules and conditions for affixing the wheel mark; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards the specific obligations of the economic operators; lists the conformity-checking procedures made available to manufacturers; aligns the Directive with Decision 768/2008 as regards the EU declaration of conformity; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards notification, notifying authorities, notified bodies and their respective regimes; fully aligns the Directive with the general EU market surveillance framework, including as regards the safeguard procedure. Checks on board may be necessary and are therefore regulated; contains the specific regime in exceptional circumstances, largely taken from the existing Directive. This regime concerns exemptions in cases of technical innovation or for the purpose of testing and evaluation. Lastly, as regards the implementation measures, the Commission: shall be empowered to uniformly implement the requirement for marine equipment to comply with the specific design, construction and performance requirements laid down in the international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, as defined by the Legislator; is also empowered to adopt common criteria and procedures for the application of these requirements and standards; is charged with the task of gathering and publishing a significant package of information. This codifies and expands existing practice and will facilitate the implementation of the Directive by all actors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The tasks devolved to the Commission, including those for which the assistance of the European Maritime Safety Agency is foreseen, are not expected to represent an increase in workload and will be carried out with existing resources. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6781EP7, ECR%:0.895, EPP%:0.821, EFD/IDG%:0.419, Greens/EFA%:0.93, NI%:0.303, REG%:0.783, S&D%:0.79, The Left%:0.8, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}
