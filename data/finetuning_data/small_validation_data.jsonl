PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member States. It was complemented by several instruments providing specific data protection rules in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (ex-third pillar), including Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA has a limited scope of application , since it only applies to cross-border data processing and not to processing activities by the police and judiciary authorities at purely national level. The Framework Decision leaves a large room for manoeuvre to Member States' national laws in implementing its provisions. Additionally, it does not contain any mechanism or advisory group similar to the Article 29 Working Party supporting common interpretation of its provisions, nor foresees any implementing powers for the Commission to ensure a common approach in its implementation. Due to the specific nature of the field of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, it was acknowledged in Declaration 21 (annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon) that specific rules on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data in the fields of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation based on Article 16 TFEU may prove necessary. In 2010, the European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative initiatives. In its resolution on the Stockholm Programme , the European Parliament welcomed a comprehensive data protection scheme in the EU and among others called for the revision of the Framework Decision. The Commission stressed in its Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme the need to ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is consistently applied in the context of all EU policies. In its Communication on \u201c A comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union \u201d, the Commission concluded that the EU needs a more comprehensive and coherent policy on the fundamental right to personal data protection. This proposal further details the approach for the new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the EU as presented in its Communication on this issue. The legal framework consists of two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and this proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of: (i) improving the internal market dimension of data protection, (ii) making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and, (iii) creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence, including police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. As regards this latter objective in particular, two policy options were assessed: a first one basically extending the scope of data protection rules in this area and addressing the gaps and other issues raised by the Framework Decision, and a second more far-reaching one with very prescriptive and stringent rules, which would also entail the immediate amendment of all other \"former third pillar\" instruments. A third \"minimalistic\" option based largely on interpretative Communications and policy support measures, such as funding programmes and technical tools, with minimum legislative intervention, was not considered appropriate to address the issues identified in this area in relation to data protection. The analysis of the overall impact led to the development of the preferred policy option which is incorporated in the present proposal. According to the assessment, its implementation will lead to further strengthening data protection in this policy area in particular by including domestic data processing, thereby also enhancing legal certainty for competent authorities in the areas of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 16(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive repeals Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. It defines the rules relating to processing of personal data for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal offences, and sets out the Directive's two-fold objective, i.e. to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of public safety, and to ensure the exchange of personal data between competent authorities within the Union. It defines the scope of application of the Directive. The scope of the Directive is not limited to cross-border data processing but applies to all processing activities carried out by 'competent authorities' as defined in the Directive. Principles : the proposal sets out the principles relating to processing of personal data and requires the distinction, as far as possible; between personal data of different categories of data subjects. It sets out the grounds for lawful processing, when necessary for the performance of a task carried out by a competent authority based on national law, to comply with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person or to prevent an immediate and serious threat to public security. The proposed Directive sets out a general prohibition of processing special categories of personal data and the exceptions from this general rule. It establishes a prohibition of measures based solely on automated processing of personal data if not authorised by law providing appropriate safeguards. Rights of the data subject : the proposal introduces the obligation for Member States to ensure easily accessible and understandable information, and to oblige controllers to provide procedures and mechanisms for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights. This includes the requirement that the exercise of the rights shall be in principle free of charge. It specifies the obligation for Member States to ensure the information towards the data subject. It also provides the obligation for Member States to ensure the data subject's right of access to their personal data. The proposal provides that Member States may adopt legislative measures restricting the right of access if required by the specific nature of data processing in the areas of police and criminal justice, and on the information of the data subject on a restriction of access. Provisions on the rectification, erasure and restriction of processing in judicial proceedings provide clarification based on Article 4(4) of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Controller and processor : the proposal sets out that the Member States must ensure the compliance of the controller with the obligations arising from the principles of data protection by design and by default. It clarifies the position and obligation of processors, and adds new elements, including that a processor that processes data beyond the controller's instructions is to be considered a co-controller. It introduces the obligation for controllers and processors to maintain documentation of all processing systems and procedures under their responsibility. Data security : the Article on the security of processing is based on the current Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46 on the security of processing, and Article 22 of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, extending the related obligations to processors, irrespective of their contract with the controller. The proposal introduces an obligation to notify personal data breaches, inspired by the personal data breach notification, clarifying and separating the obligations to notify the supervisory authority and to communicate, in qualified circumstances, to the data subject. It also provides for exemptions on reasons set out in the Directive. Data Protection Officer : the proposal introduces an obligation for the controller to appoint a mandatory data protection officer who should fulfil the tasks listed in the Directive. Where several competent authorities are acting under the supervision of a central authority, functioning as controller, at least this central authority should designate such a data protection officer. Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations : transfers to third countries may take place only if the transfer is necessary for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. The proposal lays down that transfers to a third country may take place in relation to which the Commission has adopted an adequacy decision of the level of protection or, in the absence of such decisions, where appropriate safeguards are in place. It furthermore sets out the criteria for the Commission\u2019s assessment of an adequate or not adequate level of protection, and expressly includes the rule of law, judicial redress and independent supervision. It also provides for the possibility for the Commission to assess the level of protection afforded by a territory or a processing sector within a third country. In addition, the proposed Directive: defines the appropriate safeguards needed prior to international transfers, in the absence of a Commission adequacy decision. These safeguards may be adduced by a legally binding instrument such as an international agreement. Alternatively, the data controller may on the basis of an assessment of the circumstances surrounding the transfer conclude that they exist; spells out the derogations for data transfer; obliges Member States to provide that the controller informs the recipient of any processing restrictions and takes all reasonable steps to ensure that these restrictions are met by recipients of the personal data in the third country or international organisation; explicitly provides for international co-operation mechanisms for the protection of personal data between the Commission and the supervisory authorities of third countries. Independent national supervisory authorities : the proposal obliges Member States to establish supervisory authorities and to enlarge the mission of these authorities to contribute to the consistent application of the Directive throughout the Union, which may be the supervisory authority established under the General Data Protection Regulation. It clarifies the conditions for the independence of supervisory authorities, implementing case law of the Court of Justice. It sets out the competence of the supervisory authorities. It obliges Member States to provide for the duties of the supervisory authority, including hearing and investigating complaints and promoting the awareness of the public on risk, rules, safeguards and rights. A particular duty of the supervisory authorities in the context of this Directive is, where direct access is refused or restricted, to exercise the right of access on behalf of data subjects and to check the lawfulness of the data processing. Co-operation : the proposal introduces rules on mandatory mutual assistance. It provides that the European Data Protection Advisory Board, established by the General Data Protection Regulation, exercises its tasks also in relation to processing activities within the scope of this Directive. Remedies, liability and sanctions : the proposal provides: (i) for the right of any data subject to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (ii) that the bodies, organisations or associations which may lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject and also in case of a personal data breach independently of a data subject's complaint; (iii) for the right to a judicial remedy against a supervisory authority; (iv) the data subject may launch a court action for obliging the supervisory authority to act on a complaint; (v) the right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor; (vi) for the introduction of common rules for court proceedings, including the rights of bodies, organisations or associations to represent data subjects before the courts, and the right of supervisory authorities to engage in legal proceedings; (vii) for the Member States to provide for the right to compensation and lay down rules on penalties, to sanction infringements of the Directive, and to ensure their implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Data Protection Supervisor as specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. These implications require reprogramming of Heading 5 of the Financial Perspective. The total appropriations are estimated at EUR 24.339 million for 2014-2020. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cybersecurity is an issue of common interest of the Union. Future security depends, among others, on enhancing technological and industrial ability to protect the Union against cyber threats, as both civilian infrastructure and military capacities rely on secure digital systems. Following the 2013 cybersecurity strategy, the Union has continued to increase its activities to meet the growing challenges of cybersecurity: in 2016, the Union adopted its first measures in the area of cybersecurity through Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council on security of network and information systems; the creation in 2016 of the Public-Private Partnership (\u2018cPPP\u2019) on cybersecurity in the Union was a solid first step bringing together the research, industry and public sector communities to facilitate research and innovation in cybersecurity and within the limits of the 2014-2020 financial framework should result in good, more focused outcomes in research and innovation. It will have triggered up to EUR 1.8 billion of investment by 2020; in September 2017, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy presented a joint Communication on \u2018Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU\u2019 to further reinforce the Union\u2019s resilience, deterrence and response to cyber-attacks; at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017, Heads of State and Government called on the Union to become a global leader in the field of cybersecurity by 2025. With more than 660 cyber security competence centres throughout the EU, the EU already has considerable expertise in this area. However, the efforts of the research and industry communities are fragmented, lacking alignment and a common mission, which hinders the EU's competitiveness in this field. The Commission considers that these efforts and expertise need to be pooled, networked and used in an efficient manner to reinforce and complement existing research, technology and industrial capacities at Union and national levels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: among the main arguments in favour of the selected option were: the ability to create a real cybersecurity industrial policy by supporting activities related not only to research and development but also to market deployment; the flexibility to allow different cooperation models with the community and the network of competence centres to optimise the use of existing knowledge and resources; the ability to structure cooperation of the public and private stakeholders coming from all relevant sectors, including defence. CONTENT: this Regulation proposes to establish the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, as well as the Network of National Coordination Centres, and lays down rules for the nomination of National Coordination Centres as well as for the establishment of the Cybersecurity Competence Community. The Competence Centre : its role would be to facilitate the work of the Network of National Coordination Centres and to enhance the cybersecurity competences, by driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating access to the expertise so gathered. To this end, it would coordinate the use of cybersecurity funds under the EU's next long-term budget for the period 2021-2027 under the Digital Europe Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme. Its objectives would be: \u00b7 to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, knowledge and infrastructures at the service of industries, the public sector and research communities; \u00b7 to contribute to the wide deployment of the latest cyber security products and solutions across the economy; \u00b7 to improve the understanding of cybersecurity and contribute to reducing skills gaps in the Union related to cybersecurity; \u00b7 to contribute to the reinforcement of cybersecurity research and development in the Union; \u00b7 to enhance synergies between the civilian and defence dimensions of cybersecurity. The Competence Centre would be set up as a European partnership to facilitate joint investment by the Union, Member States and/or industry. Therefore, the proposal requires Member States to contribute a commensurate amount to the actions of the Competence Centre and Network. The principal decision-making body is the Governing Board, in which all Member States take part but only those Member States which participate financially have voting rights. The Network of National Coordination Centres : each Member State would nominate a national coordination centre to lead the Network, which would focus on developing new and expanded cybersecurity capabilities and expertise. The Network would identify and support the most relevant cybersecurity projects in Member States. The Cybersecurity Competences Community : this would contribute to the mission of the Competence Centre by enhancing and disseminating cybersecurity expertise throughout the Union. It would involve a large and diverse group of actors involved in the development of cybersecurity technologies, such as research organisations, supply and demand side industries and the public sector. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union's contribution to the Competence Centre to cover administrative and operating costs includes the following elements: EUR 1 981 668 000 from the Digital Europe Programme, of which up to EUR 23 746 000 for administrative costs; EUR 2.8 billion from the Horizon Europe programme, including for administrative costs; this contribution will be proposed by the Commission during the legislative process and, in any case, before a political agreement is reached."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ECR%:0.129, EPP%:0.783, EFD/IDG%:0.688, Greens/EFA%:0.98, NI%:0.077, REG%:0.836, S&D%:0.796, The Left%:0.077, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Regulation (EU) No 691/2011). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: sound information on the key trends, pressures and drivers for environmental change is essential for the development of effective policy, its implementation, and the empowerment of citizens more generally. Users put much emphasis on analysis and applications of environmental accounts in modelling and outlooks, both for preparing policy proposals and reporting on policy implementation and impacts. Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts covers three modules: (i) air emissions accounts ; (ii) environmental taxes ; (iii) material flow accounts. It contains a list of possible new modules to be introduced later based on Commission proposals. In accordance with the Regulation, several such pilot studies have been completed which clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the three new modules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal has been discussed, in the framework of the European Statistical System, with data producers and users. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal of the amending act seeks to extend the coverage of Regulation 691/2011 to include the following additional modules: a module for environmental protection expenditure accounts; a module for environmental goods and services sector accounts; a module for physical energy flow accounts. These three new modules contribute directly to the Union's policy priorities of green growth and resource efficiency by providing important information on indicators such as market output and employment in the EGSS, national environmental protection expenditure and the use of energy in a detailed NACE breakdown. No new data collection is necessary for implementing the new modules. The United Nations Statistical Commission has adopted the System of Environmental- Economic Accounting (SEEA) as an international statistical standard at its 43rd session in February 2012.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (\u2018light commercial vehicles\u2019): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: technical measures are rules governing how and where fishermen may fish. They aim to control the catch that can be taken with a given amount of fishing effort and also to minimise the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem. They concern: (i) measures that regulate the operation of the gear; (ii) minimum sizes below which fish must be returned to the sea; (iii) measures that set spatial and temporal controls to protect aggregations of juvenile or spawning fish; (iv) measures that mitigate the impacts of fishing gears on sensitive species or closed areas to protect sensitive habitats. The history of technical measures applying in European fisheries legislation within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is one of numerous regulations, amendments, implementing rules and temporary technical measures introduced as stop-gaps to resolve emerging problems. Across all Union sea basins and non-Union waters in which Union vessels operate there are more than 30 regulations which contain technical measures. With the new challenges of the new CFP, which came into force on 1 January 2014, the retrospective evaluation concluded that the current regulatory structure for technical measures will continue to be sub-optimal. This is because of five identifiable problems: sub-optimal performance : technical measures provide little incentive to fish selectively where there is no cost to discarding, or of catching sensitive species or impacting adversely on the seabed; difficult to measure effectiveness : the current regulations do not contain any defined metrics on which to measure success; prescriptive and complex rules : some measures are difficult for control authorities to enforce, and for fishermen to comply with; lack of flexibility : technical measures are mostly decided following a complex, inflexible and lengthy politically-driven process which is not well suited to defining detailed technical rules that need frequent updating and periodic review; insufficient involvement of key stakeholders in the decision-making process. These repeated failures to reach agreement on a new technical measures regulation clearly highlight the need for a new approach which aims to change the governance structure of technical measures rather than making wholesale changes to the measures themselves, the improved flexibility and incentives for fishing selectivity it introduces will deliver improvements in the effectiveness of technical measures. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred approach is that of a new framework Regulation containing a) general provisions (scope, objectives, guiding principles) and definition of the expected results and corresponding standards; b) common rules and technical provisions; and c) baseline standards (by region) corresponding to identified results which would function as default measures in the context of regionalisation. The preferred option largely presents changes to the regulatory structure and governance of technical measures. Few new measures are introduced and any changes to the substance are very much about deletion of rules in order to simplify and lessen administrative burden, improve controllability or consolidate nature conservation measures. CONTENT: the proposal has the following structure: Subject matter : the proposed Regulation lays down technical measures concerning: (a) the taking and landing of fisheries resources; and (b) the operation of fishing gears and the interaction of fishing activities with marine ecosystems. The proposal contains general provisions, overarching and specific objectives, targets linked to the general and specific objectives expressed in terms of levels of unwanted catches; thresholds for bycatches of sensitive species; and reduction in the extent of the seabed significantly affected by fishing; principles of good governance and definitions. The definitions relate primarily to the definition of fishing gears and fishing operations and are common to all regions. They consolidate and update the existing definitions contained in the existing Regulations. Common technical measures : the proposal contains common rules currently contained in all of the primary technical measures regulations but applicable to all sea basins and considered as de facto permanent as there is no need or justification for changing them. The provisions included under this part are: prohibited gears and practices including prohibition on the sale of marine species caught using certain gear types, measures to protect sensitive species (e.g. marine mammals, reptiles and seabirds) and habitats (e.g. coldwater corals) including those listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives; general restrictions on the use of towed gears and conditions for their use (covers basic codend construction and permissible attachments to fishing gears); restrictions on the use of static nets. This includes the consolidation of the existing restrictions on the use of driftnets (i.e. prohibition to use drift nets above 2.5km, prohibition on using such gears to target highly migratory species and the total prohibition on the use of driftnets in the Baltic). Under regionalisation Member States should strengthen these provisions up to and including the introduction of a total prohibition on the use of such gears where there is scientific evidence that shows the continued use of driftnets constitutes a threat to the conservation status of sensitive species in that region; minimum conservation reference sizes; common measures to reduce discarding. Regionalisation : regionalisation sets the general principles for regionalisation with reference to baseline measures which will apply where no regional measures are in places and establishes the empowerments needed for regionalisation of technical measures through multiannual plans, temporary discard plans and conservation measures necessary for compliance with obligations under environmental legislation. The regional measures that can be taken under temporary discard plans are also defined, as well as safeguards that will be taken if scientific evidence shows that the conservation objectives are not being met by the regional measures. To this effect, a safeguard clause is included that allows the Commission to act where available scientific advice indicates that immediate action is required to protect marine species. Such measures could include restrictions on the use fishing gears or on fishing activities in certain areas or during certain periods. Technical Measures in non-Union waters : the Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of existing detailed rules concerning lists of vulnerable marine ecosystems and also specific technical measures related to defined fisheries for blue ling and redfish agreed by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Annexes : the Annexes contain baseline measures by sea basin (i.e. North Sea, Baltic, Northwestern waters, Southwestern waters, Mediterranean, Black Sea and the outermost regions). These baseline measures will apply in the absence of measures being put in place regionally. There are also annexes containing a list of prohibited species that if caught as bycatches must be returned immediately to the sea; closed areas established for the protection of sensitive habitats and a list of species that are prohibited for capture with driftnets. Reporting : by the end of 2020 and every third year thereafter, the Commission will report on the implementation of this Regulation including an assessment of the impact of technical measures on the conservation of fisheries resources and on the environmental impacts of fisheries on marine ecosystems. On the basis of that report, the Commission will propose any necessary amendments. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ECR%:0.657, EPP%:0.769, EFD/IDG%:0.292, Greens/EFA%:0.1, NI%:0.231, REG%:0.269, S&D%:0.691, The Left%:0.038, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of Title V acquis and therefore does not participate in the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013, which allows law enforcement authorities to consult Eurodac for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. On 8 March 2006, the Agreement between the European Community and Denmark concerning the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged by a third-country national in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and the 'Eurodac' system for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention was concluded. However, access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes does not fall within the scope of that agreement. At a meeting on 14 May 2014 with representatives of the Commission, Denmark and the associated countries confirmed their interest in entering into negotiations with the European Union to extend the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to them via an international agreement. The negotiations have been finalised and an Agreement in the form of a Protocol to the Agreement of 8 March 2006, extending the application of the Agreement of 8 March 2006 to law enforcement was initialled. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision aims to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention, extending that agreement to law enforcement. The Protocol establishes the application of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 to Denmark regarding access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes. The Protocol: - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of the other participating States and Europol to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by Denmark when trying to establish the identity of, or obtain more information on, a terrorist or serious crime suspect;; - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of Denmark to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by the other participating States; - guarantees that the current EU level of protection of personal data is applicable to the processing of personal data pursuant to the Protocol by the authorities of Denmark and of the Member States; - conditions the access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes by Denmark by prior legal and technical implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA with regard to dactyloscopic data.
