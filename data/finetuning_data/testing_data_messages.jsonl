PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007, which entered into force in December 2009, rail passengers have rights to information, reservations and tickets, assistance, care and compensation in the event of a delay or cancellation, free of charge assistance (for persons with disabilities), compensation in the event of an accident or quick access to a complaint handling system. In its 2013 report on the application of the Regulation, the Commission highlighted certain problematic areas which were confirmed by an impact assessment in 2016/2017. With this proposal to recast the existing legislation, the Commission wishes to better protect passengers no matter where they travel in the EU. It aligns rail with general aspects of passenger rights legislation on other transport modes, notably non-discrimination, contingency planning, disability training, complaint handling and enforcement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were broken down, in a sequential approach analysing and comparing costs and benefits and selecting a preferred policy scenario per theme: (i) exemptions; (ii) the applicability of the rights of persons with reduced mobility to all services; (iii) information for persons with reduced mobility; (iv) assistance to persons with reduced mobility; (v) handling of complaints and monitoring of enforcement by national enforcement agencies; (vi) definition of throughticket; (viii) force majeure; (ix) information for all travellers; (x) non-discrimination. CONTENT: the main elements of proposal recasting Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 are as follows: Uniform application of rules : to date, many Member States have frequently used national exemptions, which deprive travellers to a large extent of their rights. The proposal: removes exemptions for long-distance domestic services by 2020; removes exemptions for cross-border urban, suburban and regional services; requires that Member States grant exemptions only if they can prove that passengers are adequately protected on their territory. The Commission proposal updates the existing rules on rail passenger rights in five key areas: Information and non-discrimination : in order to improve provision of information about passenger rights at booking, the proposal: requires such information to be printed on the ticket or electronically. Notices informing passengers of their rights have to be placed in prominent positions in stations and on board; provides for passengers to be given fuller information on through tickets. Railway undertakings and ticket vendors have to make efforts to offer through tickets. They must prove that they informed passengers where their passenger rights do not apply to the whole journey but only to its segments; introduces a general clause prohibiting any form of discrimination, e.g. based on nationality, residence, location or currency of payment. Better rights for persons with disabilities or reduced mobility : mandatory right to assistance on all services and full compensation for loss or repair of mobility equipment. Relevant information has to be given in accessible formats and rail staff must receive disability awareness training. Enforcement, complaint-handling and sanctions : the proposal clarifies the procedure and deadlines for passengers to lodge complaints. It specifies the responsibilities of national enforcement bodies in cross-border cases and requires them to cooperate effectively. Force majeure : in 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the current Regulation does not allow for railway undertakings to be exempted from compensating passengers for delays caused by force majeure, thus creating a distinction between rail and other modes of transport. The proposal introduces a 'force majeure' clause which would exempt railway undertakings from paying compensation for delays only in very exceptional situations caused by severe weather conditions and natural disasters. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households\u2019 access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: on 26 March 2010, the European Council agreed to the European Commission's proposal to launch a new strategy for jobs and growth, Europe 2020, based on enhanced coordination of economic policies, which will focus on the key areas where action is needed to boost Europe\u2019s potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness. To that end, the European Council agreed to set EU headline targets, which constitute shared objectives guiding action of the Member States and of the Union. The Treaty on the functioning of the EU provides that Member States are to regard their economic policies and promoting employment as matters of common concern and coordinate them within the Council. In two distinct articles, it provides that the Council is to adopt broad economic policy guidelines (Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article 148), specifying that the latter must be consistent with the former. Given this legal basis, the guidelines for employment and economic policies are presented as two distinct \u2014 but intrinsically interconnected \u2014 legal instruments: A Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union -Part I of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines; A Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States \u2013Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines. These guidelines implemented by the above mentioned legal instruments form together the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. The employment guidelines were adopted on 21 October 2010, and as provided by the adoption decision should remain stable until 2014 to ensure a focus on implementation. The overall objectives and priorities expressed in the guidelines for the employment policies remain valid. Consequently, with this proposal, the Commission maintains the guidelines adopted in 2010. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission proposes that the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States set out in the Annex to Council Decision of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States are maintained for 2014 as they were in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The employment guidelines shall be taken into account by the Member States in their employment policies."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since 1984, EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit when a directive (Directive 1984/253/EEC) harmonised the procedures for the approval of auditors. Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, was adopted in 2006 and considerably broadened the scope of the former Directive. The financial crisis has highlighted weaknesses in the statutory audit especially with regard to Public-Interest Entities (PIE), such as banks insurance companies and listed companies. Given that many banks revealed huge losses from 2007 to 2009 on the positions they had held both on and off balance sheet, it is difficult for many citizens and investors to understand how auditors could give clean audit reports to their clients (in particular banks) for those periods. Statutory auditors and audit firms play an important role in society. They are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits of public-interest entities with a view to enhancing the degree of confidence of the public in the annual and consolidated financial statements of such entities. In view of the public interest, better audit quality would contribute to the orderly functioning of markets by enhancing the integrity and efficiency of financial statements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment resulted in the following preferred policy options: \u00b7 the scope of statutory audit should be clarified and specified and the information that the auditor provides to users, the audited entities, audit committees and supervisors improved; \u00b7 the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services to the audited entities and even the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services in general would effectively address the need to reinforce independence and professional scepticism. Moreover, stricter rules in the procedure for the appointment of auditors and the introduction of mandatory audit firm rotation would contribute to higher quality audits; \u00b7 in order to facilitate an objective choice of an audit provider, contractual clauses limiting audit firm choice should be prohibited, the transparency on audit quality and on audit firms should be increased and an audit quality certification should be established; \u00b7 ownership restrictions should be lifted in order to increase the choice of audit providers; \u00b7 national audit supervisory authorities should be strengthened and an EU-wide cooperation within the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should be set up. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal lays down conditions for carrying out the statutory audit on the financial statements of PIEs. Directive 2006/43/EC already deals with certain requirements which apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. Those requirements will no longer be comprised in the Directive, but integrated (and further developed) in this Regulation. The main points are as follows: Conditions for carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities : \u00b7 an auditor should establish adequate policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Regulation regarding independence, internal quality control systems and the supervision of employees; \u00b7 former auditors, key audit partners or their employees are not allowed to take up a key management position in the audited entity, to become a member of the audit committee of the audited entity, to become a non-executive member of the administrative body or to join the supervisory body of the audited entity within two years after the termination of the audit engagement; \u00b7 the statutory auditor, audit firm or member of the audit firm's network will be prevented from providing certain non-audit services to their audited entities. For other non-services that are not fundamentally incompatible with the audit services, the audit committee or the competent authority will be empowered to assess whether or not they may be provided to the audited entity; \u00b7 audit firms of significant size should focus their professional activity on the carrying out of statutory audit and should not be allowed to undertake non- audit services; \u00b7 the content of the audit report disclosed to the public is expanded so that it: (i) explains the methodology used, especially how much of the balance sheet has been directly verified and how much has been based on system and compliance testing, the levels of materiality applied to perform the audit, the key areas of risk of material misstatements of the financial statements; (ii) explains whether the statutory audit was designed to detect fraud and, (iii) in the event of a qualified or adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, explain the reasons for such a decision; \u00b7 the auditor should also prepare a longer and more detailed report for the audit committee. This report would provide more detailed information on the audit carried out, on the situation of the undertaking as such (e. g. going concern) and the findings of the audit combined with the necessary explanations; \u00b7 the auditor should keep certain documents and information for a period of five years. The appointment of statutory auditors or audit firms by public-interest entities: \u00b7 in order to reinforce the independence and capacity of the audit committee, the latter should be composed of non-executive members, at least one member should have experience and knowledge in auditing and another one in accounting and/or auditing; \u00b7 the proposal for the appointment of the auditor to the meeting of shareholders should be based on a recommendation of the audit committee. Unless it concerns the renewal of an audit engagement, the recommendation should contain at least two choices (excluding the incumbent auditor) and the audit committee should express a justified preference for one of them. The recommendation of the audit committee should be made after the completion of a due tendering process; \u00b7 the proposal introduces mandatory rotation of audit firms after a maximum period of 6 years that may be, under certain exceptional circumstances, extended to 8 years; \u00b7 where a public-interest entity has appointed two or more statutory auditors or audit firms, the maximum duration of the engagements will be 9 years; on an exceptional basis, such duration may be extended to 12 years. It also provides for a cooling-off period before the audit firm is able to carry out the statutory audit of the same entity again. Surveillance of the activities of auditors and audit firms carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities: \u00b7 each Member State should designate a competent authority responsible for the supervision of auditors and audit firms auditing PIEs. The proposal requires that the EU-wide cooperation between competent authorities takes place within ESMA; \u00b7 a 'voluntary' pan-European audit quality certification is introduced to increase the visibility, recognition and reputation of all audit firms having capacities to conduct high quality audits of PIEs. ESMA should publish the requirements for obtaining the certificate along with any administrative and fee implications. Supervisory measures and penalties: administrative pecuniary sanctions on auditors and PIEs for identified violations are envisaged. Authorities should be transparent about the sanctions and measures they apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no direct or indirect impact on the European Union budget. In particular, tasks that would be entrusted to EU supervisory bodies as mentioned in the proposal would not entail additional EU funding. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it can be estimated that around one million workers are posted each year by their employers from one Member State to another. Posting thus concerns 0.4% of the active population of EU-15 sending countries and 0.7% of the active population of EU-12 sending countries. In terms of labour mobility within the EU, the number of postings represented 18.5% of non-national EU-27 citizens in the labour force in 2007. The economic importance of posting exceeds by far its quantitative size, as it can play a crucial economic role in filling temporary shortfalls in the labour supply in certain professions or sectors (e.g. construction and transport). Furthermore, the posting of workers enhances international trade in services with all advantages linked to the Single Market such as higher competition, and efficiency gains. Posted workers are covered by Directive 96/71/EC (the Posting of Workers Directive). The Directive aims to reconcile the freedom to provide cross-border services under Article 56 TFEU with appropriate protection of the rights of workers temporarily posted abroad for that purpose. It sets out mandatory rules at EU level that must be applied to posted workers in the host country, and establishes a core set of clearly defined terms and conditions of work and employment that must be complied with by the service provider in the host country to ensure the minimum protection of workers. The Directive thus provides a significant level of protection for workers and also plays a key role in promoting a climate of fair competition between all service providers by guaranteeing both a level playing field and legal certainty for service providers, service recipients, and workers posted for the provision of services. However, the Commission\u2019s evaluation of the Directive in 2003 identified several deficiencies and problems of incorrect implementation. Guidelines adopted in 2006 aimed at clarifying the extent to which certain national control measures could be justified in view of the Court of Justice\u2019s jurisprudence. In its Communication of 2007 the Commission highlighted several shortcomings as regards the way controls were carried out in some Member States and the poor quality of administrative cooperation and access to information. The judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking-Line, Laval, R\u00fcffert and Commission v Luxembourg cases triggered an intense debate among EU institutions, academics and social partners. This focused on two major issues: \u00b7 how to set the right balance between the exercise by trade unions of their right to take collective action, including the right to strike, and the economic freedoms enshrined in the TFEU, in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services; \u00b7 how to interpret some key provisions in Directive 96/71/EC, such as the concept of public policy, the material scope of the terms and conditions of employment imposed by the Directive and the nature of mandatory rules, in particular the minimum wage. In October 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution, calling on all Member States properly to enforce the Posting of Workers Directive and emphasised that the freedom to provide services as one of the cornerstones of the European project should be balanced, on the one hand, against fundamental rights and the social objectives of the Treaties and on the other hand, against the right of the public and social partners to ensure non-discrimination, equal treatment and the improvement of living and working conditions. By facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition, this initiative will allow the potential for growth offered by the posting of workers and jobs for posted workers to be tapped as a key element in the provision of services in the internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives based on an external study. All options were analysed against the following specific objectives: \u00b7 better protection of the rights of posted workers; \u00b7 facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition; \u00b7 improving legal certainty as regards the balance between social rights and economic freedoms, in particular in the context of the posting of workers. The preferred option is a combination of different measures. A package of regulatory measures to deal with the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of the minimum working conditions and with the abuse of posted worker status in order to evade or circumvent legislation, combined with non- regulatory measures to deal with controversial or unclear interpretation of the terms and conditions of employment required by Directive 96/71/EC, is considered to be overall the most effective and efficient solution to address the specific objectives. Furthermore, a positive impact on SMEs and especially micro-businesses can be expected thanks to the improved and clearer regulatory environment. Micro-businesses will not be excluded from the of the proposal scope because this would undermine one of the proposal's key objectives - the fight against letter box companies - and it would create considerable new loopholes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: without re-opening Directive 96/71/EC, this proposal aims to improve, enhance and reinforce the way in which the latter Directive is applied and enforced in practice across the EU. It aims to establish a general common framework of appropriate provisions and measures for better and more uniform implementation, application and enforcement of the Directive, including measures to prevent any circumvention or abuse of the rules. It ensures at the same time guarantees for the protection of posted workers\u2019 rights and the removal of unjustified obstacles to the free provision of services. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a Regulation clarifying the exercise of the right to take collective action within the context of the economic freedoms of the Single Market. Preventing abuse and circumvention - elements improving implementation and better monitoring of application of the notion of posting: the proposal: \u00b7 clarifies the definition of \u2018posted worker\u2019 laid down in Directive 96/71/EC42, since it has often been difficult to determine whether there is a posting within the meaning of the Directive. Abuses have also been committed by employers exploring insufficient clarity of the legal provisions in order to circumvent the applicable rules; \u00b7 the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place is further clarified in the context of administrative cooperation. Access to information: access to advance information about the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country is a prerequisite for interested parties to be able to provide services in compliance with Directive 96/71/EC. The proposal contains a number of more detailed measures to help ensure easily accessible and generally available information on the terms and conditions to be respected, including where these are laid down in collective agreements. Administrative cooperation and mutual assistance : the proposal lays down: \u00b7 the general principles, rules and procedures necessary for effective administrative cooperation and assistance; \u00b7 the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place; \u00b7 an appropriate legal basis for the use of the separate and specific application of the Internal Market Information System (\u2018IMI\u2019) as the electronic information exchange system to facilitate administrative cooperation on the posting of workers; \u00b7 accompanying measures to develop, facilitate, support, promote and further improve administrative cooperation and to increase mutual trust, including through financial support. Monitoring compliance : these provisions cover national control measures, including those which may be applied to legally resident and lawfully employed third-country nationals who are posted within the EU by their employer, as well as inspections. A review clause has been included in order to evaluate the situation further, in particular to examine the necessity and appropriateness of the application of national control measures in the light of the experiences with the functioning of the system of administrative cooperation as well as technological developments. In its case law, the ECJ has further clarified the compatibility of certain national control measures with EU law. The Commission discusses the relevant case law and states that it is considered appropriate to clarify this case law by codifying it in the proposal, indicating clearly which requirements are compatible with obligations under EU law and which are not. By complying with their obligations, Member States would substantially contribute to reducing administrative burdens and SMEs would benefit from better enforcement of the existing Directive, a more level playing field and fairer competition. Improved administrative cooperation and effective and adequate inspections based on risk assessment would make inspections more effective and reduce costs for companies in non-risk sectors or situations and thus contribute to less burdensome controls. Furthermore, effective and adequate inspections, primarily based on regular risk assessment by the competent authorities, should be carried out in order to control and monitor compliance with the applicable rules. In order to reflect the different industrial relations systems and diversity of systems of control in the Member States, other actors and/or bodies may also monitor certain terms and conditions of employment of posted workers, such as the minimum rates of pay and working time. Enforcement: the proposal sets out provisions on the enforcement and defence of rights, which in itself concerns a fundamental right: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union confirms the right to effective remedy for everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the EU are not respected. Complaint mechanisms : the proposal sets out provisions on effective mechanisms for posted workers to lodge complaints directly or through designated third parties, such as trade unions, subject to their approval. Joint and several liabilities : the protection of workers rights is a matter of particular concern in subcontracting chains, which are particularly widespread in the construction sector in the EU. There is evidence that, in a number of cases, posted workers are exploited and left without payment of wages or part of the wages they are entitled to under the Directive 96/71/EC. The European Parliament has adopted several resolutions on this issue, calling upon the Commission to establish a legislative instrument on joint and several liability at EU level, in particular for long subcontracting chains (see However, a cautious approach is required in this respect in order to take due account of the variety of legal systems in place in the Member States, as well as the impact such a system may have on cross-border service provision within the Internal Market. The proposal contains specific provisions concerning contractors\u2019 obligations and (joint and several) liability with respect to compliance with the relevant terms and conditions of employment of posted workers by subcontractors. The focus is on preventive measures, combined with the possibility for Member States who so wish to implement more far-reaching systems of joint and several or chain liability. The provisions are limited to the construction sector, as defined by the list of activities included in the Annex to the Directive. Posting by temporary work agencies is included provided it is aimed at activities in the construction sector. However, Member States may, if they so wish, extend these provisions to other sectors. This balanced package of measures should reflect sufficiently the diversity of existing systems at national level, while at the same time avoiding adding unnecessary or unjustified administrative burden for companies. Joint and several liability is a mechanism of self-regulation between private actors and a far less restrictive and more proportionate system than possible alternative systems such as pure state intervention by inspections and sanctions. Cross-border enforcement of administrative fines and penalties : the absence of a common mutual recognition and enforcement instrument has been identified as causing major practical enforcement problems and difficulties. In a number of Member States the sanctions imposed are of a penal or criminal nature, whereas in others they are governed by administrative law, and a combination of the two can also be found. Existing EU instruments, such as Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA and the Brussels I Regulation, govern to a certain extent some of the fines and penalties imposed. With respect to fines and penalties of an administrative nature, which can be appealed to courts other than penal courts, similar instruments do not exist. Therefore, the proposal sets out a system for the cross-border enforcement of such administrative fines and penalties. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is expected to have implications for the EU budget: costs for grants (projects, seminars, exchange of good practice etc) of EUR 2 million as well as for the Expert Committee on the Posting of Workers of EUR 0. 264 million per year will be covered by PROGRESS (2013) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation (2014-2020); costs of EUR 0.5 million for an ex-post evaluation study in 2016 will be covered by the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; costs for human resources of EUR 0.232 million and other administrative expenditure (travel costs EUR 0.01 million; stakeholder conferences every second year EUR 0.36 million) will be covered under heading 5 of the Multiannual Financial Framework."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers' interests to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market. Applicable as of 29th December 2005, the Regulation achieves this aim by creating an enforcement cooperation network between public enforcement authorities and thus increasing consumer confidence in taking up cross-border offers, and preventing sellers and suppliers from evading enforcement to the competitive detriment of law-abiding sellers and suppliers. The network established by the Regulation monitors and enforces legislation which protects consumers' interests. The legislation which falls into the scope of the network is listed in the Annex referred to in Article 3(a) of the Regulation. The amendment of the Annex will consist of the removal from the Annex of legislation which is not relevant for consumer protection cooperation and the updating of references to old legislation which is no longer in force by references to the current legislation in the field of consumer protection. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the proposed amending Regulation does not have significant economic, social and environmental impacts, an impact assessment is not necessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the overall goals of the proposed amending regulation are to ensure that Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws remains efficient and continues to guarantee that there is no discrimination between intra-EU and national transactions as to the effectiveness with which infringements are pursued by the competent national authorities. To achieve these goals, the proposed amending regulation has as its objective to update the contents of the Annex to the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation to reflect recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection. The proposal deletes obsolete legislation referred to in the Annex and replaces them with references to legislation currently in force. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein has been initiated by the Commission. The new Regulation was to have superseded the various acts incorporated in it. In the meantime the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. \u00b7 Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts). \u00b7 Article 291 of the TFEU allows the legislator to confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed (implementing acts). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE). CONTENT: Regulation (EC) No 338/97 contains provisions for which such a delegation of power or such a conferral of implementing powers would be opportune. It is therefore proposed to transform the codification of Regulation (EC) No 338/97 into a recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendments. The Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU in respect of the adoption of certain measures regulating trade in species of wild fauna and flora, of certain amendments to the Annexes to the Regulation and of additional measures to implement resolutions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (CITES), decisions or recommendations of the Standing Committee of the Convention and recommendations of the Convention Secretariat. When preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, the Commission should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. Lastly, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}]}

The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, exercising its prerogatives as an association committee in accordance with Rule 50 of the Parliament\u2019s Rules of Procedure, was also consulted for an opinion on the report. The committee recommended that Parliament\u2019s position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows: A sustainable industry policy strategy in the Union : the committee stressed the need to exclude unfair tenders comprising goods and/or services originating outside the Union. At the same time, reciprocity and fair conditions for the market access of Union industries should be ensured. Keep the principle of uniformity of the Common Commercial Policy (CCP): to prevent distortion of the internal market, and ensure efficient leverage through the CCP, Members stated that that Member States or their contracting authorities may restrict the access of third country goods and services to their tendering procedures only by measures provided for in the Regulation or by relevant Union law, and only after an investigation by the Commission has revealed the absence of substantial reciprocity by the third country concerned. Scope: the Regulation shall apply to the award of contracts and to the award of concessions for services provided for governmental purposes. It is proposed to exclude from the scope of the Regulation developing countries considered to be vulnerable due to a lack of diversification and insufficient integration within the international trading system as well as countries and potential GSP+ beneficiary countries. Rules of origin : the determination of the origin of a service should be made in line with the principles of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The provisions determining the rules of origin of services should prevent the circumvention of restrictions on access to the Union public procurement market through the establishment of \"letterbox\" companies. Procedure : Members wanted to ensure that the term 'calendar days' is consistently used throughout the proposal instead of 'days', 'calendar days' and 'working days'. They also shortened the length of the procedures throughout the proposal to provide faster protection, and made amendments intended to avoid an endless consultation procedure with third countries. Public contracts : in the performance of public contracts economic operators must comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions. A \u2018lack of substantial reciprocity\u2019 shall be presumed, where the non-observance of international labour law provisions listed in the Directive on public procurement. Assess impact and review the instrument : the report proposes incorporating a review clause, which obliges the Commission to look into the impact of the regulation, after it has come into force and being applied for a few years. Accordingly, when the Commission submits its second report, it shall also submit a legislative proposal for an amended Regulation or set out the reasons why, in its view, no changes are necessary. For the same reason, the report suggests limiting the application of any restrictive measures taken through an implementing act to up to 5 years so as to avoid these measures turning into a permanent closure of the market."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings. In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. This draft Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should also be noted that in order to provide urgent financing, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. This period refers to elapse of time between a draft legislative act being made available to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a provisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a position under a legislative procedure. CONTENT: the Council proposes that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (MFF Regulation) should therefore be amended to stipulate that the commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the Global Margin for Commitments. Margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global Margin for Commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 on a European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC), the Commission adopted on 29 July 2011 a Report on the application of the aforementioned Regulation . In that Report, the Commission announced its intention to propose a limited number of modifications to the EGTC Regulation to facilitate the establishment and operation of EGTCs, as well as clarification of certain existing provisions. Obstacles to establishing new EGTCs should be removed while maintaining continuity in and facilitating the operation of existing ones, thus allowing more extensive use of EGTCs to contribute to better cooperation and policy coherence among public bodies without additional burden on national or European administrations. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. The Regulation draws on extensive consultation with stakeholders, including Member States, regions and members of existing and planned EGTCs. The message from all groups, and most especially the active EGTCs and those under preparation, was clear: the instrument is useful and has potential going beyond its anticipated functions, but the procedures for operating and especially setting up EGTCs are more complex and uncertain than they should be. LEGAL BASIS: the third subparagraph of Article 175 in conjunction with Articles 209(1) and 212(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this amending Regulation makes changes, on the one hand, to respect the terminology introduced by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and on the other hand in response to the weaknesses and areas of potential improvement identified in the Report referred to above.  The philosophy behind the changes can be expressed in three keywords: Continuity; Clarity; Flexibility. These changes concern: membership : the proposal employs new legal bases to permit regions and bodies in non-Member States to be members of an EGTC, whether the other members are from one or many Member States. The eligibility of membership of bodies under private law is also clarified; the content of the Convention and Statutes of an EGTC, its purpose : under the proposal, the convention and statutes of an EGTC are re-defined and the distinction in approval procedure underlined; the process of approval by national authorities : the proposal stipulates that th e criteria for approval or rejection by national authorities are specified, and a limited time for examination proposed (this is the single most frequently heard complaint from existing and planned EGTCs); applicable law for employment and for procurement : s olutions, in line with the acquis of the Union, are proposed for tax and social security regimes for employees of an EGTC, who may be employed in any of the Member States whose territories comprise the EGTC. A similar approach is proposed for procurement rules; liability : where some local or regional bodies are required by their national laws to have limited liability and others, in different Member States, are required to have unlimited liability, an insurance-based solution modelled on that used for European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERIC) is proposed; more transparent procedures for communication : Member States will be required to inform the Commission of any provisions adopted to implement the EGTC Regulation, as amended, and each newly established EGTC should inform the Commission of its purpose and membership, for publication in the Official Journal (C Series). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EGTC Regulation is not a financial regulation and carries no budgetary implications for the Union or for Member States. EGTCs may be funded by local, regional or national funds and may carry out actions that are co-funded by European funds. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. IMPACT ANALYSIS: no impact analysis was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 87(2)(a) and 88 (2), in conjunction with Article 218 (6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal sets out the text of the new Agreement between the EU and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The main elements of the this Agreement can be summarised as follows: Purpose of the Agreement :like the previous version, the purpose of this Agreement is to ensure, with full respect for the privacy, protection of personal data, and other conditions set out in this Agreement, that: financial payment messages referring to financial transfers and related data stored in the territory of the European Union by providers of international financial payment messaging services, that are jointly designated pursuant to this Agreement, are provided to the U.S. Treasury Department for the exclusive purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing; relevant information obtained through the TFTP is provided to law enforcement, public security, or counter terrorism authorities of Member States, or Europol or Eurojust, for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing. Data concerned : the Agreement applies to the obtaining and use of financial payment messaging and related data with a view to the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of acts of a person or entity that involve violence, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or create a risk of damage to property or infrastructure, and which, given their nature and context, are reasonably believed to be committed with the aim of: intimidating or coercing a population; intimidating, compelling, or coercing a government or international organisation to act or abstain from acting; seriously destabilizing or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic, or social structures of a country or an international organisation. It may also concern data from a person or entity assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services to or in support of, abovementioned acts. Since the new systems architecture of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication \u2013SWIFT- (hereinafter referred to as the \"designated provider\") became operational on 1 January 2010, a significant volume of the data which were previously received by the U.S. Treasury Department under the TFTP, have not been available, undermining the benefits of the TFTP not least for the European Union. Ensuring Provision of Data by Designated Providers : the Agreement stipulates that the Parties, jointly and individually, shall ensure that entities jointly designated by the Parties under this Agreement as providers of international financial payment messaging services (\"Designated Providers\", i.a. Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication - SWIFT-) provide to the U.S. Treasury Department requested financial payment messaging and related data which are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing (\"Provided Data\"). U.S. Requests to Obtain Data from Designated Providers : for the purposes of this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall serve production orders (\u201cRequests\u201d), under authority of U.S. law, upon a Designated Provider present in the territory of the United States in order to obtain data necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing that are stored in the territory of the European Union. The Request (together with any supplemental documents) shall: identify as clearly as possible the data, including the specific categories of data requested, that are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing; clearly substantiate the necessity of the data; be tailored as narrowly as possible in order to minimize the amount of data requested, taking due account of past and current terrorism risk analyses focused on message types and geography as well as perceived terrorism threats and vulnerabilities, geographic, threat, and vulnerability analyses; not seek any data relating to the Single Euro Payments Area. A copy of the Request shall be sent to Europol. O nce Europol has confirmed that the Request complies with the requirements of the Agreement, the Request shall have binding legal effect as provided under U.S. law, within the European Union as well as the United States. The Designated Provider is thereby authorised and required to provide the data to the U.S. Treasury Department. Safeguards Applicable to the Processing of Provided Data : the U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure that Provided Data are processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement The TFTP shall avoiddata mining or any other type of algorithmic or automated profiling or computer filtering. The U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure that Provided Data are processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure the protection of personal data by means of a series of safeguards set out in the Agreement. Provisions on data security and integrity are also laid down in the Agreement. Necessary and Proportionate Processing of Data : all searches of Provided Data shall be based upon pre-existing information or evidence which demonstrates a reason to believe that the subject of the search has a nexus to terrorism or its financing. Provided Data may include identifying information about the originator and/or recipient of a transaction, including name, account number, address, and national identification number. The Parties recognize the special sensitivity of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious or other beliefs, trade union membership, or health and sexual life (\u201csensitive data\u201d). In the exceptional circumstance that extracted data were to include sensitive data, the U.S. Treasury Department shall protect such data in accordance with the safeguards and security measures set forth in this Agreement and with full respect and taking due account of their special sensitivity. Retention and Deletion of Data : during the term of this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall undertake an ongoing and at least annual evaluation to assess the data retention periods to ensure that they continue to be no longer than necessary to combat terrorism or its financing. Where such data are identified, the U.S. Treasury Department shall permanently delete them as soon as technologically feasible. If it transpires that financial payment messaging data were transmitted which were not requested, the U.S. Treasury Department shall promptly and permanently delete such data and shall inform the relevant Designated Provider. All non-extracted data received prior to 20 July 2007 shall be deleted not later than 20 July 2012. All non-extracted data received on or after 20 July 2007 shall be deleted not later than five years from receipt. Not later than three years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department shall prepare a joint report regarding the value of TFTP Provided Data, with particular emphasis on the value of data retained for multiple years and relevant information obtained from the joint review conducted pursuant to the Agreement. Onward Transfer : provisions are laid down as regards the onward transfer of information extracted from the Provided Data. Such information shall be shared for lead purposes only and for the exclusive purpose of the investigation, detection, prevention, or prosecution of terrorism or its financing.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) no 663/2009 established a programme to aid economic recovery for Europe (EEPR) by granting \u20ac3.98 billion by the end of 2010. This Community financing was allocated to three sub-programmes in the field of gas and electricity infrastructure projects; offshore wind electricity projects (OWE), and carbon capture and storage projects (CCS). It is estimated in the report from the Commission of 27 April 2010 on the implementation of the EEPR that almost the entire EEPR financial envelope will be committed in the course of spring 2010. An amount of around \u20ac114 million will however not be committed under the EEPR Regulation. The amount of uncommitted funds will be known by the end of 2010. In the spirit of the Europe 2020 strategy for sustainable growth and jobs, the development of further renewable sources and the promotion of energy efficiency would contribute to Greener Growth, building a competitive and sustainable economy, and tackling climate change. By giving support to these policies, Europe will create new jobs and green market opportunities fostering the development of a competitive, secure and sustainable economy. Providing for increased financial incentive and technical assistance is a key element to address the barriers of high up-front cost and lack of information and stimulate sustainable energy improvements. In a market constrained by the prevailing economical crises and in a time of caution by commercial banks, generating low investment rates, there are additional barriers for project financing to promote this policy area. Existing experiences across Europe demonstrate how well-targeted and well-designed financial aid policies can lead to massive improvement and succeed to tap the development potential of sustainable energy. Investments help in sustainable energy can be most effective and beneficial when targeted at municipal and local levels. In the 2nd Strategic Energy Review, the European Commission's announced its intention to launch a Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative in cooperation with the European Investment Bank and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in order to establish appropriate financing mechanisms for the massive development of energy efficiency and renewable energies. A dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives within the Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative should therefore be created to use the uncommitted funds under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 663/2009. IMPACT ANALYSIS: no impact analysis was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(1)(c) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to use the uncommitted funds under Chapter II of the EEPR Regulation for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives within the Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative. The financial facility shall support the development of bankable energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and facilitate the financing of investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, in particular in urban settings. In order to foster a large number of decentralised investments, municipal, local and regional public authorities will be the beneficiaries. The approach will build up on the success of the Covenant of Mayors, signed up by more than 1600 regions and cities across Europe. The sustainable energy projects to be financed include public and private buildings, high energy efficient combined heat and power (CHP) and district heating/cooling networks (in particular from renewable energy sources), decentralised renewable energy sources embedded in local settings, clean urban transport and local infrastructure such as smart grids, efficient street lighting, and smart metering. So as to maximise the impact of the EU funding in the short term, the facility should be managed by one or several financial intermediaries such as International Financial Institutions (IFIs). The selection should be operated on the basis of the demonstrated capacity of the financial intermediaries to use the funding in the most efficient and effective way and with the highest leverage between the EU funding and the total investment in order to raise significant investments in the EU. In compliance with Regulation (EC) No 663/2009, the facility should be limited to the financing of measures that have a rapid, measurable and substantial impact on economic recovery within the EU, increased energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 should fully apply to the selection and eligibility of the measures financed under the facility. The geographical balance of the projects should also be taken into account as an essential element. Since the exact amount of uncommitted funds may be known just by the end of 2010, individual legal commitments implementing budgetary commitments should be made by 31 March 2011. Due to the urgent need to address the economic crises and the Union's pressing energy needs, expenditure should be eligible as from 13 July 2009 as many applicants requested the eligibility of expenditure from the submission of the grant application in line with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (Financial Regulation). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the European Union\u2019s budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 November 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Japan. The negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan have been successfully concluded. The Agreement provides that single distilled shochu, as defined in the Liquor Tax Law of Japan, produced by pot still and bottled in Japan, shall be allowed to be placed on the market of the European Union in traditional bottles of sizes of four go and one sho, corresponding to nominal quantities of 720 ml and of 1800 ml, respectively, provided that other applicable legal requirements of the European Union are fulfilled. Directive 2007/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that spirit drinks put up in pre-packages may only be placed on the Union market if they are prepacked in the nominal quantities listed in section 1 of the Annex to that Directive. For spirit drinks, section 1 of the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC refers to nine nominal quantities on the interval from 100 ml to 2000 ml. These nominal quantities do not include 720 ml and 1800 ml, the nominal quantities in which single distilled shochu produced by pot still is bottled and marketed in Japan. A derogation from the nominal quantities set out in the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC for spirit drinks is therefore necessary to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the Union market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a trade sustainability impact assessment of the EPA between the EU and Japan was carried out by the external contractor \u201cLondon School of Economics Enterprises\u201d. The details of it are provided in Commission proposal for a Council Decision on the signing on behalf of the European Union, of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan. CONTENT: the proposal aims at introducing a derogation from Union rules concerning bottle sizes, for single distilled shochu, a spirit drink produced by pot still and bottled in Japan that is traditionally sold in bottles of sizes of four go or one sho that correspond to nominal quantities of 720 ml (one go corresponds to 180 ml) and 1800 ml, respectively, and that are currently not among the nominal quantities permitted in the Union under Directive 2007/45/EC laying down rules on nominal quantities of prepacked products. This derogation needs to be introduced by an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the market in all Member States simultaneously upon the entry into force of the Agreement."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on comitology sets out the mechanism for the control of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers by Member States. Under the most frequently used procedure, the so-called \u201cexamination procedure\u201d, the Commission representatives submit draft implementing acts to a committee composed of representatives from the Member States, which gives its opinion, generally by vote. The appeal committee was introduced in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 in order to elevate the debate, in particular in case the examination committee did not deliver an opinion, to a more political level. The Commission has found itself in the past years in a situation where it is legally obliged to take an authorisation decision in the absence of a qualified majority of the Member States taking position (either in favour or against) in the committee. This 'no opinion' situation is in the Commission's view particularly problematic when it concerns politically sensitive matters of direct impact on citizens and businesses, for instance in the field of health and safety of humans, animals or plants (e.g. GMOs or glyphosate). The Commission considered that Member States should, in these specific situations, also assume their responsibilities in the decision-making process to a greater extent. It is for this reason that it has proposed amendments to improve the functioning of the comitology procedures at the level of the appeal committee in order to ensure wider political accountability and ownership of politically sensitive implementing acts. CONTENT: this proposal provides for targeted and limited amendments to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 and thus relates to implementing acts only. The Commission proposes to: amend the voting rules for the appeal committee in order to reduce the risk of a no opinion scenario and to clarify the positions of the Member States. To this end, the proposal stipulates that only Member States which are present or represented, and which do not abstain, should be considered as participating Member States for the calculation of the qualified majority. In order to ensure that the voting outcome is representative a vote should only be considered valid if a simple majority of the Member States are participating members of the appeal committee; provide the possibility of a further referral to the appeal committee at ministerial level where no opinion is delivered. The changes proposed aim at reducing the risk of no opinion outcomes at the appeal committee level and at facilitating the decision-making and to ensure the political ownership of Member States of certain sensitive decisions; increase the transparency of the comitology procedure by proposing that the votes of the Member States' representatives taken in the appeal committee be made public (they are currently confidential); enable the Commission to formally refer specific cases after a no opinion outcome in the appeal committee for a non-binding opinion to the Council, with a view to obtaining its political orientation on the implications of the no opinion outcome."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 changed the economic outlook for the years to come in the Union and in the world, calling for an urgent and coordinated response from the Union in order to cope with the enormous economic and social consequences for all Member States.

In this context, as a complement to the REACT-EU initiative, the Commission proposes to strengthen the current framework for support to Member States and to provide direct financial support to Member States through an innovative tool to underpin long-term reforms and investments - notably in green and digital technologies - that will have a lasting effect on the productivity and resilience of the Union's economy. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes the \u2018Recovery and Resilience Facility\u2019. The scope of the instrument covers a wide range of policy areas, including areas related to cohesion, the dual transition (green and digital), competitiveness, productivity, health and smart innovation. Purpose The objective of the Facility is to promote the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union by (i) improving the resilience and adjustment capacity of Member States, (ii) mitigating the social and economic consequences of the crisis, and (iii) supporting the green and digital transitions towards a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. It shall thus contribute to restoring the growth potential of Member States' economies in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, encourage job creation and foster sustainable growth. To this end, the Facility shall provide Member States with direct financial support to reach milestones and targets for reforms and investments. Recovery and resilience plans To benefit from the Facility, Member States shall prepare recovery and resilience plans setting out their reform and investment programmes for the next four years, i.e. until 2024. These plans shall include reforms and public investment projects to be implemented through a coherent package. The plans shall be consistent with the challenges and priorities identified in (i) the European Semester framework, (ii) the National Reform Programmes, (iii) the National Energy and Climate Plans, (iv) the Just Transition Plans and (v) the Partnership Agreements and Operational Programmes adopted under EU funds. Member States shall submit their plans to the Commission by 30 April each year at the latest, but they may submit a first draft together with their draft national budget in October. The plans may form an annex to the relevant national reform programme. The Facility shall: - identify reforms and investments to address the challenges identified in the context of the European Semester and explain, inter alia, how they enhance the growth potential and economic and social resilience of the Member State concerned and contribute to greater cohesion; - include measures relevant to the green and digital transitions; - set out estimated total costs and appropriate milestones, targets and an indicative timetable for the implementation of the reforms and of the investments. Provided that the evaluation criteria are satisfactorily met, the Commission shall adopt a decision fixing the financial contribution to be received by the Member State (grant and, where appropriate, loan), as well as the milestones and targets. For the purposes of informing the preparation and the implementation of the recovery and resilience plans by Member States, the Council may discuss in the context of the European Semester the state of recovery, resilience and adjustment capacity in the Union on the basis of the Commission\u2019s strategic and analytical information available. The recovery and resilience plans adopted by the Commission shall be communicated to the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission shall also report annually to both institutions on the progress made in the implementation of the plans by Member States and on expenditure under the Facility. Budgetary implications The financial envelope for the implementation of the facility shall be EUR 602 905 000 000 (in current prices). The envelope shall be financed from the borrowing operations of the Union. The bulk of the funding shall be provided in the form of grants, with possible supplements through loans. The total amount of grants available shall amount to EUR 334.950 million, while a further EUR 267.955 million shall be available in the form of loans. As far as grants are concerned, a maximum amount per Member State shall be determined on the basis of a predefined allocation key taking into account population, GDP per capita and unemployment. Member States may also apply for a loan for the implementation of their public reforms and investments. The maximum volume of loans for each Member State shall not exceed 4.7% of its gross national income. Given the temporary nature of the financing scheme of the Facility in relation to Member States\u2019 economic recovery, the availability period of these resources is limited to 31 December 2024 for both the non-repayable financial support and for the loan support. As regards the non-repayable financial support, for at least 60 % of the total resources the necessary legal commitments should be entered into by 31 December 2022."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 25 September 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an international agreement with ASECNA establishing the conditions for the provision of a satellite-based augmentation service (SBAS) in Africa on the basis of the EGNOS European satellite navigation programme. The Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation was signed on 5 December 2016, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The European Union and Africa have been cooperating on satellite navigation since the 2011-2013 action plan implementing the Africa-EU strategic partnership. The need for cooperation in this field was reaffirmed in the 2014-2017 roadmap adopted at the Africa-EU summit in April 2014. The European satellite navigation programmes form a key part of European Union transport policy, especially air transport. They have been promoted internationally, mainly as a result of cooperation agreements entered into with countries such as the United States of America, China, South Korea and Israel. CONTENT: this proposal for a Council Decision seeks to authorise the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation. The Agreement establishes a framework for the cooperation required for setting up and operating an independent SBAS system, but based on the European EGNOS system, in ASECNA's area of competence. The aims of this Agreement are to develop satellite navigation and to provide associated services in ASECNA\u2019s area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation by enabling it to benefit from European satellite navigation programmes. The Agreement comprises a technical part and also covers questions of financing and governance. The Union shall assist ASCENA in: The parties shall cooperate on: Financing: the cost of setting up and operating the infrastructure provided for by the Agreement, which belongs to ASECNA, will be financed by ASECNA's budget, by its member states or by contributions, in the form of loans or donations, from countries in the European Union and international financial institutions. In order to set up and operate the SBAS-ASECNA system, the Union will facilitate ASECNA's access to its cooperation and development funds for both current and future programmes. The Agreement provides for the setting up of a joint committee for management and correct implementation."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Directive 2009/65/EC, each undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) must provide \u2018key investor information\u2019 to help investors understand the essential characteristics of the UCITS and make informed investment decisions. Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a key information document. The arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. The Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and to implement the other proposed measure [which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653] from 1 July 2022. As things stand, as of 1 July 2022 retail investors in UCITS would receive both a key information document in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and key investor information in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC. It is desirable to avoid a situation where retail investors receive two different pre-contractual disclosure documents in respect of the same UCITS. The proposed measures are necessary to reduce the consequences of parallel application of Directive 2009/65/EC and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. CONTENT: this proposal inserts a new article in Directive 2009/65/EC which lays down in a clear, precise and unconditional manner that, where a key information document is drawn up, provided, revised and translated for a UCITS pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, it should be considered as satisfying the requirements applicable to key investor information for the purposes of that Directive."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the emissions limits for non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) are currently set out in Directive 97/68/EC. This Directive was amended a number of times, but several technical reviews have concluded that the legislation in its current form has shortcomings. Non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) covers a large variety of combustion engines installed in machines ranging from small handheld equipment, construction machinery and generating sets, to railcars, locomotives and inland waterway vessels. These engines contribute significantly to air pollution and are accountable for roughly 15% of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and 5% of the particulate matter (PM) emissions in the EU. The proposal also ties in with the industrial policy update of 2012 and could make an important contribution to technical harmonisation in the context of the EU-US trade negotiations (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - TTIP). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment took into account in the analytical design that the preferred choice might be a combination of elements from different options. Alongside the no-policy change scenario, these options are: alignment with US standards in scope and limit values. step towards road sector ambition levels, for the most relevant emission sources. extended level of ambition through enhanced monitoring provisions. CONTENT: the proposal significantly upgrades the NRMM engine type-approval system with respect to the technical requirements on emissions by adopting stricter levels, as well as introducing the \u201csplit-level approach\u201d which is already used in other pieces of legislation in the area of EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach foresees legislation in two steps: first, the fundamental provisions will be laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on the ordinary legislative procedure; secondly, the technical specifications implementing the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU. The draft proposal and its implementing and delegated acts will carry over and improve on the existing requirements laid down in Directive 97/68/EC. Compared to the existing act, the proposal for a regulation will: introduce new emission limits reflecting technological progress and EU policies in the on-road sector, with a view to achieving EU air quality targets; extend the scope , with a view to improving market harmonisation (EU and international) and minimising the risk of market distortions; introduce measures for simplifying administrative procedures and improving enforcement, including conditions for better market surveillance. In particular, the delegated acts adopted under this proposal will include, amongst others: detailed technical requirements of the test cycles; technical test and measurement procedures; detailed arrangements and requirements for the exceptions granted under this Regulation; detailed provisions for type-approval procedures. The proposal also provides general and specific transitional periods in order to allow sufficient lead time for engine and machinery manufacturers, as well as for administrations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the cost associated to setting up an electronic database for the exchange of type-approval information was already assessed in a feasibility study commissioned by the UNECE in June 2006. The study predicted one off start-up costs in the EUR 50 000 to EUR 150 000 range and operating costs of EUR 5 000 to EUR 15 000 per month, depending on the length of the contract with the service provider. A similar monthly range is provided for operating a help desk service, if required. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

The measures taken so far have not effectively solved the main problems of the fishery, these being: Due to deep-sea stocks' high vulnerability to fishing, stock depletion can occur within a short period of time, and recovery might take very long or fail. The stocks' biological state is largely unknown. Some are considered depleted, others have started to stabilise at low levels of exploitation. In general the fisheries are not sustainable. A new regulation is required in order to deal with these problems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of impacts resulting from different policy choices focussed on five options. Three of these were not considered further because they were considered not representing meaningful management approaches, with disadvantages largely outweighing advantages, namely: (i) to continue the current regime amending it only by needed updates; (ii) to ban fishing for deep-sea species altogether, and (iii) to scale the regime down to being a tool for transposing measures adopted in NEAFC and applying those measures also in Union waters. The two options with relative advantage were: (iv) to phase out the most harmful fishing gears targeting deep-sea species, or (v) to introduce in Union waters management standards that were developed for bottom fishing on the High Sea. Option (iv) was retained as being a more effective and simpler instrument. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes a framework Regulation for exercising fishing activity targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantics, comprising Union waters including outermost regions of Spain and Portugal, and international waters. The objectives of this Regulation are the following: \u00b7  to ensure the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea species while minimising the impact of deep-sea fishing activities on the marine environment; \u00b7  to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats for these purposes; \u00b7  to implement technical measures on fisheries management recommended by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Ensure sustainable exploitation : the general objective of the proposal is to ensure as much as possible the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea stocks while reducing the environmental impact of these fisheries, and to improve the information base for scientific assessment. As long as data and method have not achieved the required level allowing MSY-based management, the fisheries have to be managed according to the precautionary approach to fisheries management. Protect marine ecosystems : in order to reduce the destructive impact on the marine ecosystem, the use of bottom trawls should be phased out in this fishery, as they are most harmful to vulnerable marine ecosystems and have shown high levels of undesired catch of deep-sea species. The transitional restrictions on bottom-set gillnets in fisheries below 600m depth and in the depth-range 200-600m should be accompanied by a prohibition to target deep-sea species. Simplifying the management system for these stocks : the proposal also considers the opportunity to simplify the management system for these stocks, currently subject to a double instrument: catch limitations and capacity/effort limitation. Where this duplication is not necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, proposals are made to regulate the concerned fisheries with only one management instrument. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}]}

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : on 23 April 2007 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with certain countries of Central America, which resulted in a Association Agreement with Central America. The Agreement was initialled on 22 March 2011. The Agreement includes a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility of reinstating the MFN customs duty rate when, as a result of a trade liberalisation, imports take place in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. Furthermore, the Agreement also incorporates a Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas according to which, until 1 January 2020, preferential customs duties can be suspended when a certain annual import volume is reached. In order for these measures to be operational, the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism should be incorporated in EU, and the procedural aspects of their application as well as the rights of interested parties need to be specified. This is the purpose of the proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT : this proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism of the EU- Central America Association Agreement. 1) Principles on the imposition of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the Regulation where a product originating in a Central American country is, as a result of the reduction or the elimination of the customs duties on that product, being imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: a suspension of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties) to the Agreement; an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the most-favoured-nation (\"MFN\") applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of the Agreement. None of these measures shall be applied within the limits of the preferential duty free tariff quotas granted by the Agreement. Initiation of proceedings : an investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to above, to justify such initiation. The request to initiate an investigation shall generally contain the following information: the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment. An investigation may also be initiated in the event that there is a surge of imports concentrated in one or several Member States, provided that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the conditions for initiation are met. The proposal makes provision for the procedures for initiating an investigation and the conditions under which the latter may be done. Investigation : following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation, which shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of its initiation. That time limit may be extended by a further period of three months in exceptional circumstances such as the involvement of an unusually high number of parties, or complex market situations. Prior surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in a Central American country is such that it could lead to a serious threat to the Union market, imports of that product may be subject to prior surveillance measures. Such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in the text. Prior surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in a Central American country have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty. Provisional measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure, including on imperative grounds of urgency. Provisional measures shall be shall not apply for more than 200 days. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that conditions regarding a serious threat to Union industry are met, the Commission shall refer the matter to the Association Committee. Where no recommendation has been made by the Association Committee or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the referral, the Commission may adopt a decision imposing definitive safeguard measures. The text also contains provisions on the termination of investigation and proceeding without measure. Duration and review of safeguard measures : it is provided that a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, and may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the Union industry is adjusting.. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. Confidentiality and transparency : the text contains provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information received pursuant to the Regulation. Information shall in any case be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information. At the same time, when initiating an investigation, provisions are made to ensure transparency, and interested parties and representatives of the Central American country concerned may inspect all information made available to the Commission, which shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable. There ate other provisions to ensure transparency, such as such as the Commission\u2019s obligation to ensure password-protected online access to the non-confidential file through which all information which is not confidential shall be disseminated. The European Parliament shall be granted access to this online platform. 2) Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas: for bananas originating in Central America (fresh Bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category \"ST\" in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties) to the Agreement, a stabilisation mechanism shall apply until 1 January 2020. A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports from Central American country for products as indicated in the table in the Annex to the Regulation. The importation of these products at the preferential customs duty rate shall, in addition to the proof of origin established under Annex III (Definition of the concept of \"originating products\" and methods of administrative co-operation) of the Agreement with Central America, be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the competent authority of the Central American country from which the products are exported. Once the trigger volume is met during the corresponding calendar year, the Commission may temporarily suspend the preferential customs duty during that same year for a period of time not exceeding three months, and not going beyond the end of the calendar year. In case the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, the Commission shall apply the lesser of: (i) the base rate of customs duty or (ii) the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken. In case the Commission applies these actions, it shall immediately enter into consultations with the affected country to analyse and evaluate the situation on the basis of factual available data. These measures may be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: r ules on training and certification of seafarers have been agreed at an international level by means of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention), adopted in 1978 by conference at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), entered into force in 1984 and significantly amended in 1995. The STCW Convention has been integrated into Union law for the first time by Council Directive 94/58/EC of 22 November 1994 on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Afterwards the EU rules on training and certification of seafarers have been adapted to the subsequent amendments to the Convention, while a common EU mechanism for the recognition of the systems of training and certification of seafarers in the third countries has been set up; lately, the rules of the Union on this matter have through a recast become Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. In 2010 a Conference between the State Parties to the STCW Convention was held in Manila and introduced several significant changes to the Convention, namely on the prevention of fraudulent practices for certificates, in the field of medical standards, in the matter of training on security and with respect to training in technology-related matters. The Manila amendments have also introduced requirements for able seafarers and established new professional profiles, such as electro-technical officers. The Manila amendments to the Convention will enter into force on 1 January 2012. From that date onwards maritime training will have to meet the new requirements. Since the EU Member States are also parties to the Convention, and none of them opposed the Manila amendments, they will have to adapt their legislation to the new text of the Convention. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. As for the proposed directive, the experts of the Member States were consulted on the review exercise in a meeting which was held in Brussels on 3 December 2010. On that occasion the Member States unanimously expressed their wish that the Manila amendments should be integrated into EU law, while they considered that no overhaul of the directive should be carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal is to integrate into EU law the 2010 amendments to the STCW Convention, in order in particular to avoid any conflict between the international and the EU obligations of the Member States. New rules introduced following the Manila amendments : the 2010 amendments regard both the \"Regulations\" annexed to the Convention and the more technical \"Code\", whose Part \"A\", as explained, is mandatory. The main amendments to the Convention, which are reflected in the present proposal, are: strengthened provisions concerning training and assessment, the issuance of certificates of competency, as well as for prevention of fraudulent practices; updated standards relating to medical fitness, fitness for duty as well as alcohol abuse; new requirements concerning certification for able seafarers, for electro-technical officers as well as security-related training for all seafarers; updated requirements for personnel on certain types of ships; clarification and simplification of the definition of \"certificate\". In addition, the proposal has adapted the STCW provisions on watchkeeping, in order to bring them in line with the EU rules on working time for seafarers. Deadline for the recognition of third countries : t he proposal also aims to make more realistic the current three-month deadline for the recognition of third countries currently provided for in Article 19(3) of Directive 2008/106. This deadline shall be extended to 18 months. This provision is about the timeframe available to the Commission to decide on the recognition of a third country following a request by a Member State. Providing the Commission with existing information on certificates : a potential source of accurate data is the certificates and endorsements issued by the national administrations. Currently, under the STCW Convention State Parties are obliged to maintain registers of all certificates and endorsements and the relevant revalidations or other measures affecting them. While this is an important source of data, the different formats used by each Member State do not allow for a complete picture. Therefore, the present proposal foresees a new provision requiring the Member States to provide standardised information to the Commission for the purpose of statistical analysis. The detailed content of such information is presented in a technical annex to the present proposal. Adaptation to the new rules on \"comitology\" : the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced significant changes to the \"comitology\" mechanism. Under the new Treaty the procedure for technical adaptation of the directive is governed by the rules on \"delegated acts\", while the decisions on recognition of third countries by those on \"implementing acts\". The present proposal contains provisions to that effect. Entry into Force and Transitional Arrangements : the amendments to the STCW Convention agreed at Manila will enter into force on 1 January 2012. Since at that point in time the present proposal will not have been adopted yet, it has been foreseen that the proposed directive should enter into force as soon as it is published in the Official Journal. The Manila agreement also includes transitional arrangements. These arrangements allow for the renewal and revalidation of certificates issued before the entry into force of the amended Convention on 1 January 2012. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission."}]}

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual use items requires dual-use items (including software and technology) to be subject to effective control when they are exported from or transit through the Union, or are delivered to a third country as a result of brokering services provided by a broker resident or established in the Union. In order to enable Member States and the European Union to comply with their international commitments, Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes the common list of dual use items and technology referred to in Article 3 of that Regulation, which implements internationally agreed dual-use controls. These commitments were taken within the context of participation in the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Technological progress in today's world means that there is a need to update regularly the list of controlled items. The last update of Annex I of the Regulation occurred on the occasion of the adoption of the Regulation on 5 May 2009. Since this time, all of the international export control regimes have taken decisions to modify and update their control lists. Consequently, there is a need to make modifications to Annex I. Details of the modifications to the definitions and the general note and of modifications to items in categories 1-9 are given in the proposal. For the purpose of clarity and ease of use of Annex I, the Commission is proposing to replace the entire Annex I with a new text incorporating the changes discussed.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: at present, systems for the recovery of aviation security costs are regulated at national level and are not always transparent to the users. Users are not systematically consulted at all EU airports before charges are determined or before a charging system is modified. This proposal sets common principles for the levying of security charges at Community airports and applies to any airport located in a territory subject to the provisions of the Treaty. However, it does not apply to the charges collected for the remuneration of en-route and terminal air navigation services in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1794/2006, or to the charges collected for the remuneration of ground-handling services referred to in the Annex to Council Directive 96/67/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers four policy options: Option 1 : No EU action; Option 2 : Self-regulation. Option 3 : EU Directive on non-discrimination, transparency, cost-relatedness and possibility to appeal; Option 4 : Full state funding of airport security. Options 1 and 2 do not attain the objectives, while options 3 and 4 effectively address the concerns of discriminatory and excessive security charges. Option 4, however, discourages more efficient aviation security services because there are no incentives for the security providers to control costs. The increased administrative burden of option 3 is negligible because the same authority as established by the Directive on airport charges can be used. Consequently, option 3 offers the most efficient overall solution. CONTENT: the proposal defines a number of basic principles to be respected by airport operators when they determine their security charges. These are: Non-discrimination : aviation security charging systems should not discriminate between carriers or passengers. Consultation and remedy : the airport managing body and the air carriers serving the airport, or their representative organisations, must engage in a dialogue on the security charging system applicable at an airport not only when such system is modified but also when the levels of the security charges are being established. The aim of this requirement is that the two parties exchange views on a regular basis on the levels of the charges, as well as on all factors and regulatory requirements that have an influence on the determination of those charges. Transparency : the proposed Directive contains no provisions on the methods for calculating security charges that should be applied in each Member State. While the Commission acknowledges the wide diversity of airport regulation in the various Member States, a reasonable amount of information must nevertheless be provided by the operator to the air carriers so as to make the consultation process between airports and air carriers meaningful. To this end, the Directive establishes which information should be provided on a regular basis by the airport managing body. Air carriers should, in turn, give information as to their traffic forecasts, their intended fleet use and their present and future specific requirements at the airport, so as to allow the airport managing body to employ their capital and dedicate their capacity in an optimal manner. Air carriers should also have the right to be informed about security measures that are more stringent than required by Community law. Cost-relatedness : revenues from security charges shall only be used to meet security costs. Supervisory authority : a draft Directive that contains the principles to be respected by the main partners in the air transport industry i.e. the airports and air carriers, which have diverging interests, needs to be properly applied and adhered to at the level of the Member States. An authority to be established in each Member State that is in charge of ensuring the correct application of the Directive would be an appropriate guarantee that its provisions are respected. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cybersecurity is an issue of common interest of the Union. Future security depends, among others, on enhancing technological and industrial ability to protect the Union against cyber threats, as both civilian infrastructure and military capacities rely on secure digital systems. Following the 2013 cybersecurity strategy, the Union has continued to increase its activities to meet the growing challenges of cybersecurity: in 2016, the Union adopted its first measures in the area of cybersecurity through Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council on security of network and information systems; the creation in 2016 of the Public-Private Partnership (\u2018cPPP\u2019) on cybersecurity in the Union was a solid first step bringing together the research, industry and public sector communities to facilitate research and innovation in cybersecurity and within the limits of the 2014-2020 financial framework should result in good, more focused outcomes in research and innovation. It will have triggered up to EUR 1.8 billion of investment by 2020; in September 2017, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy presented a joint Communication on \u2018Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU\u2019 to further reinforce the Union\u2019s resilience, deterrence and response to cyber-attacks; at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017, Heads of State and Government called on the Union to become a global leader in the field of cybersecurity by 2025. With more than 660 cyber security competence centres throughout the EU, the EU already has considerable expertise in this area. However, the efforts of the research and industry communities are fragmented, lacking alignment and a common mission, which hinders the EU's competitiveness in this field. The Commission considers that these efforts and expertise need to be pooled, networked and used in an efficient manner to reinforce and complement existing research, technology and industrial capacities at Union and national levels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: among the main arguments in favour of the selected option were: the ability to create a real cybersecurity industrial policy by supporting activities related not only to research and development but also to market deployment; the flexibility to allow different cooperation models with the community and the network of competence centres to optimise the use of existing knowledge and resources; the ability to structure cooperation of the public and private stakeholders coming from all relevant sectors, including defence. CONTENT: this Regulation proposes to establish the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, as well as the Network of National Coordination Centres, and lays down rules for the nomination of National Coordination Centres as well as for the establishment of the Cybersecurity Competence Community. The Competence Centre : its role would be to facilitate the work of the Network of National Coordination Centres and to enhance the cybersecurity competences, by driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating access to the expertise so gathered. To this end, it would coordinate the use of cybersecurity funds under the EU's next long-term budget for the period 2021-2027 under the Digital Europe Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme. Its objectives would be: \u00b7 to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, knowledge and infrastructures at the service of industries, the public sector and research communities; \u00b7 to contribute to the wide deployment of the latest cyber security products and solutions across the economy; \u00b7 to improve the understanding of cybersecurity and contribute to reducing skills gaps in the Union related to cybersecurity; \u00b7 to contribute to the reinforcement of cybersecurity research and development in the Union; \u00b7 to enhance synergies between the civilian and defence dimensions of cybersecurity. The Competence Centre would be set up as a European partnership to facilitate joint investment by the Union, Member States and/or industry. Therefore, the proposal requires Member States to contribute a commensurate amount to the actions of the Competence Centre and Network. The principal decision-making body is the Governing Board, in which all Member States take part but only those Member States which participate financially have voting rights. The Network of National Coordination Centres : each Member State would nominate a national coordination centre to lead the Network, which would focus on developing new and expanded cybersecurity capabilities and expertise. The Network would identify and support the most relevant cybersecurity projects in Member States. The Cybersecurity Competences Community : this would contribute to the mission of the Competence Centre by enhancing and disseminating cybersecurity expertise throughout the Union. It would involve a large and diverse group of actors involved in the development of cybersecurity technologies, such as research organisations, supply and demand side industries and the public sector. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union's contribution to the Competence Centre to cover administrative and operating costs includes the following elements: EUR 1 981 668 000 from the Digital Europe Programme, of which up to EUR 23 746 000 for administrative costs; EUR 2.8 billion from the Horizon Europe programme, including for administrative costs; this contribution will be proposed by the Commission during the legislative process and, in any case, before a political agreement is reached."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. More specifically: (i) agricultural prices have fallen sharply as a result of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions; (ii) the EU has become more open to global markets; (iii) the EU has made new commitments at international level, for example on climate change mitigation (through COP 21). On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a regulation defining the objectives of the CAP as well as rules on support for strategic plans to be developed by Member States in the framework of the CAP; a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. The CAP general objectives shall focus on the economic viability, the resilience and income of farms, on an enhanced environmental and climate performance, and on the strengthened socio-economic fabric of rural areas. Moreover, fostering knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas is a cross-cutting objective. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation seeks to maintain the architecture and main features of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 on the common organisation of the market in agricultural products while amending a limited number of provisions in view of the new challenges relating to environmental sustainability and climate change and to citizens' expectations regarding food. The proposal seeks, inter alia: to delete provisions related to sectorial interventions as these interventions of the future CAP will be regulated under the CAP strategic plan Regulation and be part of Member States' strategic plans, to ensure a better coherence of CAP interventions; to amend current rules on geographical indications (GIs) aiming at a simpler GI system, faster registration of geographical indications and more efficient approval of amendments to product specifications. The objective is to make the GI system more understandable for consumers, easier to promote, and to reduce the administrative costs associated with managing the system; to simplify some specific procedures with regard to the rules on GIs for wine to make the approval process more efficient; \u00b7 to clarify the definition of 'Protected Designation of Origin' for wines to enable producer groups to use new varietals, also needed in response to climate change; \u00b7 to strengthen the protection of GIs against counterfeiting of GIs on the interned and on goods in transit; \u00b7 to apply the proposed simplification for wine GIs has to be applied also to agricultural products and foodstuffs; \u00b7 to include provisions that merely translate into internal legislation commitments taken by the EU and its Member States in the context of recent World Trade Organization Ministerial Decisions, notably on export subsidies; \u00b7 to delete a number of obsolete provisions, inter alia the system of production regulation and requirements applying to the sugar sector that expired at the end of the 2016/2017 marketing year. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as \u2018Stage V\u2019, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: EU economies face a structural need for seasonal work for which labour from within the EU is expected to become less and less available. As regards future skills shortages, traditional sectors will continue to play an important role and the structural need for low-skilled and low-qualified workers is likely to continue expanding. It should also be pointed out that there is a more permanent need for unskilled labour within the EU. It is expected to be increasingly difficult to fill these gaps with EU national workers, primarily owing to the fact that these workers consider seasonal work unattractive. Further, there is significant evidence that certain third-country seasonal workers face exploitation and sub-standard working conditions which may threaten their health and safety. Lastly, sectors of the economy that are characterised by a strong presence of seasonal workers - most notably agriculture, horticulture and tourism - are repeatedly identified as the sectors most prone to work undertaken by third-country nationals who are staying illegally. The proposal is part of a comprehensive package of measures, proposed in the Policy Plan on Legal Migration of 2005 and further endorsed by the Stockholm Programme, adopted by the European Council in December 2009. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the following options were considered: Option 1 - Status quo. Current developments in Member States and at EU level would continue within the existing legal framework. Employers will be under certain obligations resulting from the 2009 Directive on employer sanctions as regards notifications to authorities and penalties in the case of illegal employment. The effect of this option would be limited. Option 2 - Directive on entry and residence conditions of seasonal workers and rights . Common rules would be established, including the definition of seasonal work, and admission criteria. This would help to establish a common legal framework applicable to all employers in the EU and to prevent exploitation. However, seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex procedures for entry. Option 3 - Directive laying down common admission procedures . In addition to option 2, a single work and residence permit for third-country seasonal workers would be introduced, to be issued in a single procedure. Provisions would be made for facilitating re-entry of a seasonal worker in subsequent seasons. Hiring procedures would be more efficient, and a more predictable workforce would be available for EU employers. Option 4 - Directive on measures to ensure effective return . Measures would include limitation of the length of stay, and an explicit obligation to return at the end of the period. Overstaying of seasonal workers would be prevented to some extent. Effects on the functioning of the EU labour market would be marginal. Seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex entry procedures. Option 5 - Communication, coordination and cooperation among Member States . No new legislation would be introduced, but complementary and supporting activities would be undertaken with a view to approximating Member States\u2019 practices. Effects would be limited, as the measures would not be binding; potential seasonal workers and their prospective employers would continue to face an array of different rules for admission and different rights would be granted to seasonal workers during their residence. The preferred option is a combination of options 2, 3 and 4. Common admission standards with simplified entry procedures and the prospect of returning in a subsequent season (options 2 and 3) will provide for flexible admission to endow the EU labour market with the necessary resources. Elements from option 4 should help ensure the return of the seasonal worker and thus prevent overstaying. LEGAL BASE: Article 79(2)(a) and (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal establishes a fast-track procedure for the admission of third-country seasonal workers, based on a common definition and common criteria, in particular the existence of a work contract or a binding job offer that specifies a salary equal to or above a minimum level. Seasonal workers will be issued with a residence permit allowing them to work for a specified maximum period per calendar year. Provision is also made for facilitating the re-entry of a seasonal worker in a subsequent season. In order to prevent exploitation and protect the safety and health of third-country seasonal workers, legal provisions applying to working conditions are clearly defined. Also, employers are required to provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have appropriate accommodation during his/her stay and that provision is made for facilitation of complaints. To prevent overstaying of third-country seasonal workers, a maximum duration of stay per calendar year is laid down as well as the explicit obligation to return after that period; there is no possibility of status change. The main provisions are as follows: Chapter I: General provisions Purpose :the purpose of the proposal is to introduce a special procedure for the entry and residence of third-country nationals applying to reside in the EU for seasonal employment, and to define the rights of seasonal workers. Scope : the provisions only apply to third-country nationals who reside outside the territory of the Member States. There is no provision for applications for employment as seasonal workers from within a Member State. The proposal does not apply to third-country nationals posted by undertakings established in a Member State in the framework of a provision of services in accordance with Directive 96/71/EC. Definitions : the notion of seasonal work is distinguished from regular, permanent work in particular by higher workforce requirements linked to an event or pattern of events, such as the planting or harvesting period in agriculture, or the holiday period in tourism including events, festivals, biennales or long term exhibitions in culture. Member States may determine specific sectors of the economy that meet the criteria for seasonal work. More favourable provisions : the proposal allows Member States to grant more favourable conditions only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern the procedural safeguards, the level of rights granted to seasonal workers, as well as provisions relating to accommodation and facilitation of complaints. Chapter II: Admission criteria Criteria for admission : the proposal sets out the criteria that a third-country national seasonal worker and his/her employer must fulfil. As the admission is demand-driven, a work contract or a binding job offer must be presented. They should specify a level of remuneration in order to allow the competent authorities to assess whether the proposed remuneration is comparable to that paid for the respective activity in the Member State concerned. This is vital in order to avoid an unfair advantage for the employer and exploitative working conditions for the seasonal worker. The work contract must also specify the working hours per week or month. ensure that employers only request third-country seasonal workers in case of real economic need (sufficient employment capacities); serve as a guarantee of a certain, fixed level of remuneration for the seasonal workers, and, when applicable, other relevant working conditions such as insurances; enable efficient control by the competent authorities before admission. The application must also include evidence that the respective seasonal worker will benefit from appropriate accommodation. Grounds for refusal : the proposal does not create a right to admission. These provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusal as well as for withdrawal and non-renewal, including non-fulfilment of the admission criteria, the existence of quotas and the possibility for Member States to carry out a labour market test. The principle of EU preference, as expressed in the relevant provisions of the Acts of Accession of 2003 and 2005, constitutes EU primary law, and therefore the Directive must be applied in conformity with the Acts of Accession by those Member States that still make use of the transitional arrangements. Chapter III: Procedure and permit Access to information : Member States are required to ensure that the relevant information about conditions of entry and residence, including the rights granted to third-country seasonal workers, and about all the documentary evidence necessary for lodging the application are available to prospective third-country seasonal workers and their employers. Applications : Member States have to determine whether applications are to be lodged by the third-country national or by his or her prospective employer. They are also required to designate a competent authority to receive the application and issue the permit. This designation is without prejudice to the role and responsibilities of other national authorities with regard to the examination of and decision on the application. Furthermore, the designation to receive and issue the permit should not prevent Member States from appointing other authorities with which the third-country national or his/her prospective employer can lodge the application (e.g. consular offices) and which have the authority to issue the permit. The application to reside and work as a seasonal worker must be submitted in a single application procedure. Seasonal worker permit : third-country nationals for whom a positive decision has been taken by the Member State concerned must receive a seasonal worker permit. The residence permit with the indication \u2018seasonal worker\u2019 must allow both the residence and the exercise of the specific seasonal work authorised, without an additional permit, in particular a work permit, being necessary. Accordingly, for periods of stay below three months, Member States must issue a visa that will also entitle the seasonal worker to exercise the specific employment activity for which he/she was admitted. Duration of stay : the maximum period of stay is set at six months in any calendar year. Such strict limitation of the duration of stay should contribute to ensuring that third-country national workers admitted under the Directive are actually employed for work that is genuinely seasonal and not for regular work. Explicit provision is made that within the maximum duration of stay an extension of the contract or a change of employer for seasonal work is possible. This is important because seasonal workers who are tied to a single employer may face the risk of abuse. Also, the possibility of extending the stay within the specified period of time may reduce the risk of overstaying. Facilitation of re-entry : this provision is intended to promote circular migration of third-country national seasonal workers, that is, their movement between a third country and the EU for temporary stay and work in the latter. This kind of migration will potentially benefit the country of origin, the EU host country and the seasonal worker him/herself. Accordingly, Member States have the choice of either issuing multi-seasonal permits or applying a facilitated procedure. Multi-seasonal permits cover up to three seasons and are thus appropriate for sectors where the labour market needs remain stable over a period of time. A third-country national who did not comply with the obligations linked to a previous stay as a seasonal worker is to be excluded from admission as a seasonal worker for one or more years. Sanctions : an employer who has not fulfilled obligations resulting from the work contract must be subjected to sanctions and excluded from the possibility to apply for seasonal workers for at least one year. Procedure : a fast-track procedure (30 days) is provided for examining applications. Procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decision. Accommodation: employers of seasonal workers must provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have accommodation ensuring an adequate standard of living. This covers cases where the employer is to provide accommodation and where accommodation is to be provided by a third party. Chapter IV: Rights Rights : a seasonal worker permit entitles its holder to enter and reside on the territory of the Member State which has issued the permit and to exercise the employment activity authorised by the permit. The text defines the working conditions, including pay, dismissal and health and safety requirements at the workplace applicable to seasonal workers in order to ensure legal certainty. It also grants rights to third-country seasonal workers by determining fields where equal treatment with own nationals should be ensured in the form of a minimum requirement without prejudice to the right of Member States to adopt or maintain provisions which are more favourable. Accordingly, equal treatment applies in respect of freedom of association and affiliation and membership of an organisation representing workers. Equal treatment : equal treatment also applies to social security and covers the benefits defined in Regulation (EC) No 883/04 on the coordination of social security systems. Such provisions are intended to establish common rules within the EU; to recognise that third-country national seasonal workers legally working in a Member State contribute to the European economy through their tax payments; and to serve as a safeguard to reduce unfair competition between own nationals and third-country nationals that may result from possible exploitation of the latter. Complaints: complaints mechanisms should be put in place, open not only to third-country seasonal workers, but also to designated third parties. Evidence suggests that seasonal workers are often either not aware of the existence of such mechanisms or they are hesitant to use them in their own name, as they are afraid of the consequences in terms of future employment possibilities. Chapter V: Final provisions : this chapter regulates the obligations of Member States concerning sharing the relevant statistical data and the information resulting from transposition of the Directive. It also specifies the reporting obligations of the European Commission and stipulates the date on which the Directive enters into force. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on shipments of waste (WSR) lays down requirements for shipments of waste both within the Union and between the Member States and third countries, in order to protect the environment. However, gaps have been identified in the enforcement and inspections carried out by the competent authorities in Member States due to, inter alia, a lack of clear provisions in the Regulation on these matters. Illegal waste shipments are a serious and frequent problem. In 2011 a study estimated the tonnage of illegal shipments within and out of the EU to be 2.8 million tonnes per year. The most problematic illegal waste shipments are those concerning hazardous waste and waste which is illegally sent for dumping or sub-standard treatment. The export bans for hazardous waste and waste for disposal under the WSR are often circumvented. The joint inspections carried out by the \"network for the implementation and enforcement of environmental law, trans-frontier shipments of waste-cluster\" (IMPEL-tfs) revealed very high rates of non-compliance with the WSR due to illegal waste shipments. During the period October 2008-November 2010, the overall non-compliance rate can be estimated to be 25%. Council conclusions of 3 June 2010 invited the Commission, inter alia, to consider strengthening EU requirements on inspections and spot checks carried out under the WSR. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission\u2019s impact assessment examined several options to strengthen inspections and enforcement of the WSR. The assessment concluded that a combination of EU legislative requirements and guidance would be the most effective option to address the problems related to illegal waste shipments. This option would also have the lowest net costs and the most positive economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 aims to help ensure more uniform implementation of the WSR through establishing minimum inspection requirements throughout the EU with a focus on problematic waste streams. More specifically, the proposal seeks to: strengthen the provisions regarding the enforcement of rules and inspections covered by Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 with a view to ensuring regular and consistent planning of inspections . Planning should include a number of key elements, including risk assessments, strategies, objectives, priorities, numbers and types of planned inspections, assignment of tasks, means of cooperation between authorities and provisions on training of inspectors; introduce the possibility for competent authorities in Member States to require evidence from waste exporters in order to check the legality of shipments . Such evidence may concern whether the substance or object is \"waste\" or not, whether the shipment is destined for recovery or disposal, or the nature of the specific waste treatment methods and standards applied by the facility in the country of destination. The Commission may adopt guidelines for the enforcement of the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no incidence on the EU\u2019s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Pr\u00fcm Decision (Decision 2008/615/JHA) and the Decision on the implementation of the Pr\u00fcm Decision (Decision 2008/616/JHA) are intended to improve the exchange of information between the services responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences and to strengthen cross-border police and judicial cooperation between the Member States of the Union. The Pr\u00fcm Decision contains, inter alia, provisions whereby Member States grant one another, on a mutual basis, access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities (\u2019the Forensic Decision\u2019) lays down the requirements for the exchange of DNA and fingerprint data, in order to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within any other Member State. On 10 June 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Swiss Confederation on the application of certain provisions of the Pr\u00fcm Decision, the Decision on the implementation of the Pr\u00fcm Decision and the Decision on forensic services. These negotiations were successfully concluded and resulted in the initialling of the agreement on 24 May 2018. The possibility for all the Member States to have access to the national databases of the Swiss Confederation, regarding the DNA, dactyloscopic and vehicle registration data, and the other way around, is undoubtedly of central importance in order to foster and encourage the cross border police cooperation. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Switzerland for the application of some of the provisions of the Pr\u00fcm Decision, the Pr\u00fcm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision. This international agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation aims to improve and simplify the automated exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and the associated countries, in order to stimulate international police cooperation. The Agreement lists the provisions of the Pr\u00fcm Decision, the Pr\u00fcm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision that shall become applicable to the Swiss Confederation after entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement also sets the provisions for uniform application, dispute settlement, amendments, notifications and declarations. The contracting Parties agree to carry out common review of the agreement no later than five years after its entry into force. The Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period whilst one of the Contracting Parties can terminate the Agreement at any time. The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the adoption and implementation of this Decision. Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member States. It was complemented by Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA as a general instrument at Union level for the protection of personal data in the areas of police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. The current legal framework remains sound as far as its objectives and principles are concerned, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the way personal data protection is implemented across the Union, legal uncertainty and a widespread public perception that there are significant risks associated notably with online activity. This is why it is time to build a stronger and more coherent data protection framework in the EU, backed by strong enforcement that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Personal data protection therefore plays a central role in the Digital Agenda for Europe, and more generally in the Europe 2020 Strategy. Article 16(1) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) , as introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, establishes the principle that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In 2010, the European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative initiatives. The Commission stressed in its Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme the need to ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is consistently applied in the context of all EU policies. In its Communication on \u201c A comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union \u201d, the Commission concluded that the EU needs a more comprehensive and coherent policy on the fundamental right to personal data protection. The European Parliament approved by its resolution of 6 July 2011 a report that supported the Commission\u2019s approach to reforming the data protection framework. This proposal further details the approach for the new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the EU as presented in its Communication on this issue. The legal framework consists of two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of improving the internal market dimension of data protection, making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence, including police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Three policy options of different degrees of intervention were assessed: Option 1 : this option consisted of minimal legislative amendments and the use of interpretative Communications and policy support measures such as funding programmes and technical tools; Option 2 : this option comprised a set of legislative provisions addressing each of the issues identified in the analysis and Option 3 : this option was the centralisation of data protection at EU level through precise and detailed rules for all sectors and the establishment of an EU agency for monitoring and enforcement of the provisions. The analysis of the overall impact led to the development of the preferred policy option which is based on the second option with some elements from the other two options and incorporated in the present proposal. According to the impact assessment, its implementation will lead inter alia to considerable improvements regarding legal certainty for data controllers and citizens, reduction of administrative burden, consistency of data protection enforcement in the Union, the effective possibility of individuals to exercise their data protection rights to the protection of personal data within the EU and the efficiency of data protection supervision and enforcement. LEGAL BASIS: Article 16(2) and Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. It protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. It main provisions are as follows: Principles : the proposal sets out the principles relating to personal data processing. Additional new elements are in particular the transparency principle, the clarification of the data minimisation principle and the establishment of a comprehensive responsibility and liability of the controller. It also sets out the criteria for lawful processing, which are further specified as regards the balance of interest criterion, and the compliance with legal obligations and public interest. It clarifies the conditions for consent to be valid as a legal ground for lawful processing and sets out further conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data of children in relation to information society services offered directly to them. Rights of the data subject : the proposal introduces the obligation on controllers to provide transparent and easily accessible and understandable information. It obliges the controller to provide procedures and mechanism for exercising the data subject's rights, including means for electronic requests, requiring response to the data subject's request within a defined deadline, and the motivation of refusals. In addition, the proposal: further specifies the controller's information obligations towards the data subject, providing additional information to the data subject, including on the storage period, the right to lodge a complaint, in relation to international transfers and to the source from which the data are originating; provides the data subject's right of access to their personal data, such as to inform the data subjects of the storage period, and of the rights to rectification and to erasure and to lodge a complaint; sets out the data subject's right to rectification; provides the data subject's right to be forgotten and to erasure. It further elaborates and specifies the right of erasure provided for in Article 12(b) of Directive 95/46/EC; introduces the data subject's right to data portability, i.e. to transfer data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the controller. As a precondition and in order to further improve access of individuals to their personal data, it provides the right to obtain from the controller those data in a structured and commonly used electronic format; provides for the data subject's rights to object; concerns the data subject's right not to be subject to a measure based on profiling. General obligations : the proposal takes account of the debate on a \"principle of accountability\" and describes in detail the obligation of responsibility of the controller to comply with this Regulation and to demonstrate this compliance, including by way of adoption of internal policies and mechanisms for ensuring such compliance. It sets out the obligations of the controller arising from the principles of data protection by design and by default. It introduces for controllers and processors: (i) the obligation for controllers and processors to maintain documentation of the processing operations under their responsibility, instead of a general notification to the supervisory authority; (ii) the obligation to implement appropriate measures for the security of processing; (iii) an obligation to notify personal data breaches; (iv) the obligation of controllers and processors to carry out a data protection impact assessment prior to risky processing operations. Data protection officer : the proposal introduces a mandatory data protection officer for the public sector, and, in the private sector, for large enterprises or where the core activities of the controller or processor consist of processing operations which require regular and systematic monitoring. Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations : the proposal spells out, as a general principle, that the compliance with the obligations in that chapter are mandatory for any transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations, including onward transfers. It sets out the criteria, conditions and procedures for the adoption of an adequacy decision by the Commission. The criteria which shall be taken into account for the Commission\u2019s assessment of an adequate or not adequate level of protection include expressly the rule of law, judicial redress and independent supervision. The proposal requires for transfers to third countries, where no adequacy decision has been adopted by the Commission, to adduce appropriate safeguards, in particular standard data protection clauses, binding corporate rules and contractual clauses. Independent supervisory authorities : the proposal obliges Member States to establish supervisory authorities and to enlarge the mission of the supervisory authorities to co-operation with each other and with the Commission. It clarifies the conditions for the independence of supervisory authorities, implementing case law by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Co-operation and consistency : the proposal introduces explicit rules on mandatory mutual assistance, including consequences for non-compliance with the request of another supervisory authority. It introduces a consistency mechanism for ensuring unity of application in relation to processing operations which may concern data subjects in several Member States. The proposal also establishes the European Data Protection Board, consisting of the heads of the supervisory authority of each Member State and of the European Data Protection Supervisor. The European Data Protection Board replaces the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data set up under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC. Remedies, liability and sanctions : the proposal provides: (i) for the right of any data subject to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (ii) that the bodies, organisations or associations which may lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject and also in case of a personal data breach independently of a data subject's complaint; (iii) for the right to a judicial remedy against a supervisory authority; (iv) the data subject may launch a court action for obliging the supervisory authority to act on a complaint; (v) the right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor; (vi) for the introduction of common rules for court proceedings, including the rights of bodies, organisations or associations to represent data subjects before the courts, and the right of supervisory authorities to engage in legal proceedings; (vii) for the Member States to provide for the right to compensation and lay down rules on penalties, to sanction infringements of the Directive, and to ensure their implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Data Protection Supervisor as specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. These implications require reprogramming of Heading 5 of the Financial Perspective. The total appropriations are estimated at EUR 24.339 million for 2014-2020. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: there is an alarming increase in the EU of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source. These products are, from the point of view of EU pharmaceutical legislation, illegal insofar as they do not comply with the Community rules for medicinal products. Moreover, the number of falsifications of innovative and life-saving medicines is increasing. In this way, in 2007, many thousand packs of falsified life-saving drugs reached patients in the EU. The underlying causes for falsified medicinal products remaining undetected in the legal supply chain are manifold, but can be reduced to four aspects: (i) falsified medicinal products can not always be easily distinguished from originals; (ii) the distribution chain has become very complex and is only as strong as its weakest link; (iii) there are legal uncertainties as to the regime applicable to products introduced into the EU while allegedly not being placed on the market; (iv) lastly, already the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) entering the manufacturing process may be a falsification of the original API. The existing provisions of Directive 2001/83/EC are in some respects insufficient to address these concrete causes. In view of the time span between the proposal for amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC and their effective implementation, there is a clear need for the Commission to act now. CONTENT: in order to address the risk of falsified medicinal products entering the legal supply chain, the Commission proposes a number of amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC. These include: certain obligations for stakeholders other than wholesale distributors, who are involved in the distribution chain. These stakeholders are typically involved in the transactions without actually handling the products (for example, by auctioning or brokering products); a legal basis for the Commission to render obligatory specific safety-features (such as a serial number or a seal) on the packaging of prescription-medicines; a prohibition in principle of manipulating (i.e. removing, tampering with, or over-labelling) safety features on the packaging by stakeholders situated \u201cin-between\u201d the original manufacturer and the last stakeholder in the distribution chain (typically the pharmacist) or end user (doctor/patient); compulsory audits of wholesale distributors of medicinal products in order to ensure reliability of business partners; strengthened requirements for imports of API from third countries if it could not be established that the regulatory framework in the respective third country ensures a sufficient level of protection of human health for products exported to the EU; audits of manufacturers of API; stricter rules for inspections including increased transparency of inspection results through publication in the EudraGMP database managed by the EMEA."}]}

Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As of 11 March 2022, over 310 000 refugees had entered the Republic of Moldova from Ukraine following the Russian Federation\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In just the first two weeks of the war, more than two million refugees \u2013 around 4% of Ukraine\u2019s population \u2013 mainly fled westward from the encroaching Russian forces. Moldovan border management authorities are thus now facing the twin challenges of regulating the influx and subsequent outflow of potentially hundreds of thousands of refugees, including monitoring the smuggling of weapons. Furthermore, some 12% of the territory of the country is not under the control of Moldovan authorities, including a large portion of Moldova\u2019s border with Ukraine. On 14 March 2022, the Council adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Moldova as regards actions by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency on the territory of Moldova. On 17 March 2021, on the basis of a written procedure, delegations confirmed their agreement on the proposal for a Council Decision on the signature of the Status Agreement with Moldova. The Agreement was signed the same day, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The aim of the agreement is to allow the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to deploy border management teams from the permanent contingent to Moldova. The agreement regulates all aspects necessary for the deployment of the Border Management Teams from the European Border and Coast Guard Standing Corps in the Republic of Moldova, where the members of the teams may exercise executive powers. A status agreement will allow Frontex to assist Moldova in border management, by deploying teams capable of assisting the Moldovan authorities in tasks such as registration and border checks."}]}

BACKGROUND: t he unprecedented global crisis that has hit the world over the last three years has seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in the government deficit and debt position of the Member States, leading a number of them to seek financial assistance outside the framework of the Union. The full consistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established by the Treaty and the possible policy conditions attached to this financial assistance should be enshrined in Union law. The economic and financial integration of the Member States whose currency is the euro calls for a reinforced surveillance to prevent a contagion from a Member State experiencing difficulties with respect to its financial stability to the rest of the euro area. The intensity of the economic and fiscal surveillance should be commensurate to the severity of the financial difficulties encountered and should take due account of the nature of the financial assistance received, which may range from a mere precautionary support based on eligibility conditions up to a full macro-economic adjustment programme involving strict policy conditionality IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on strengthened surveillance for the euro area builds on what has already been agreed in the \u2018Six Pack\u2019 set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December. It sets out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and/or that receive or may receive financial assistance from one or several other States, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or other International Financial Institutions (IFI), such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Enhanced surveillance : the proposed Regulation strengthening economic and fiscal surveillance of euro area countries facing or threatened with serious financial instability would ensure that the surveillance of these Member States under a financial assistance programme, or facing a serious threat of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law. The Commission would be able to decide whether a Member State experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability should be subject to enhanced surveillance. The Council would be able to issue a recommendation to such Member States to request financial assistance. A Member State under enhanced surveillance shall, in consultation and cooperation with the Commission, acting in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties. The Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under surveillance to verify the progresses made in the implementation of the measures. Where it is concluded that further measures are needed and the financial situation of the Member State concerned has significant adverse effects on the financial stability of the euro area, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may recommend to the Member State concerned to seek financial assistance and to prepare a macro-economic adjustment programme. The Council may decide to make this recommendation public. Where a recommendation is made public: (a) the relevant Committee of the European Parliament may invite representatives of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views; (b) representatives of the Commission may be invited by the parliament of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views. Macro-economic adjustment programme : a Member State receiving financial assistance from one or several other States, the IMF, the EFSF or the ESM shall prepare in agreement with the Commission - acting in liaison with the ECB - a draft adjustment programme aimed at re-establishing a sound and sustainable economic and financial situation and restoring its capacity to finance itself fully on the financial markets. The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall approve the adjustment programme. The Commission, in liaison with the ECB, shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the adjustment programme . It shall - in liaison with the ECB - examine with the Member State concerned the changes that may be needed to its adjustment programme. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide on any change to be made to the adjustment programme. Post-programme surveillance : a Member State shall be under post-programme surveillance as long as a minimum of 75% of the financial assistance received from one or several other Member State(s), the EFSM, the EFSF or the ESM has not been repaid. The Council, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend the duration of the post programme surveillance.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for Moldova. That scheme gives all products originating in the Republic of Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products listed in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties. In the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan, and the Eastern Partnership, Moldova has adopted an ambitious agenda for political association and further economic integration with the Union. The Association Agreement, including the establishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the Union and Moldova was signed on 27 June 2014 and will apply provisionally from 1 September 2014. The specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015. Recently Moldova has experienced and continues to experience difficulties with its fruit and vegetables exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the government of Moldova. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the horticultural sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 250 000 people (i.e. around 10% of the active population). Moreover, horticultural export levels have fallen in recent years. Taking into consideration the current temporary severe difficulties in accessing Moldova's traditional export markets for a number of products, the European Commission proposes to increase temporarily its fully liberalised market access for imports of these products from Moldova, allowing their commercialisation in the Union. CONTENT: in order to support the efforts of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the Association Agreement, the proposed amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces three new duty free tariff quotas for fresh apples, fresh table grapes and fresh plums. As the Autonomous Trade Preference scheme expires at the end of 2015, this amendment provides for a time-limited response to the immediate needs for the key export products adversely affected (i.e. apples, plums and table grapes). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment to the Regulation incurs negligible implications for the EU budget. The total imports from Moldova to the EU in 2013 constituted 0.1% of the total imports to the EU. Whereas about 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU duty-free, imports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes under entry price from the Republic of Moldova represented less than 0.01% of the total EU imports from the world of these products. The corresponding loss of tariff revenue should therefore have a limited impact on the EU\u2019s own resources."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union, in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner (EU ETS). Aviation activities were included in the EU emissions trading system by Directive 2008/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The \u2018European Climate Law\u2019 has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. Considering current and projected emissions from the aviation sector, and in the context of an enhanced climate ambition of the EU for 2030, the climate contribution needs to be significantly strengthened, also with a view to allow for the necessary contribution to the EU climate neutrality by 2050. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission introduces amendments to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) legislation in relation to its application to aviation to ensure that: - aviation contributes to the 2030 emissions reduction target in accordance with the European Green Deal; - the EU ETS is amended as appropriate in respect of the ICAO\u2019s Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation; and - allocation of emission allowances in respect of aviation is revised to increase auctioning. The proposal makes amendments to Directive 2003/87/EC in order to: - consolidate the total quantity of allowances for aviation at the level of allocation/auctioning for intra-European flights and departing flights from EEA airports to Switzerland and the UK. The allocation for year 2024 will be based on the total allocation to active aircraft operators in 2023. The total number of aviation allowances in the ETS will be capped at current levels and be reduced annually by 4.2% (linear reduction factor). The number of free allowances allocated to aircraft operators will be reduced progressively, with the aim of stopping free allocation to aviation by the end of 2026; - include a time-limited derogation from the EU ETS for emissions from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region of a Member State and an aerodrome located in the same Member State; - allows delegated acts to be adopted to supplement this Directive concerning the detailed arrangements for the auctioning by Member States of aviation allowances should include the modalities for the transfer of a share of revenues to the Union budget; - delete the provisions on free allocation rules to aircraft operators are no longer needed after the transition to full auctioning; - allow the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to apply to emissions from EU-based airlines for flights to and from countries outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. When emissions from flights outside the EEA reach levels higher than those in 2019, they will have to be offset by corresponding carbon offsets; - provide for EU-based airlines to use appropriate international credits for compliance for flights to or from third countries that are applying CORSIA; - ensure that fights to and from most Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States not implementing CORSIA would be exempt from EU ETS or CORSIA obligations without end date for the exemption. In parallel to these amendments to the EU ETS Directive, a separate proposal is being made to implement Member State notification to EU-based airlines of zero CORSIA offsetting for the year 2021. The separate proposal relates to CORSIA-related aspects that should be in place by November 2022, for notification of zero additional offsetting to take place by that date."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission\u2019s report on the operation of the Transparency Directive shows that the transparency requirements of the Directive are considered to be useful for the proper and efficient functioning of the market by a majority of stakeholders. However, the review of the operation of the Transparency Directive also showed that there are areas where the regime it created could be improved. In particular, Improvement of the regulatory environment for small and medium-sized issuers and their access to capital are high political priorities for the Commission, as noted in the Single Market Act Communication of April 2011. It is thus desirable to provide for the simplification of certain issuers' obligations with a view to making regulated markets more attractive for small and medium-sized issuers raising capital in Europe. Additionally, the legal clarity and effectiveness of the existing transparency regime needs to be increased, notably with respect to the disclosure of corporate ownership. Lastly, the Commission Communication on reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial services sector envisages EU legislative action to set minimum common standards on certain key issues of sanctioning regimes, to be adapted to the specifics of the different sectors. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. It sets out the best policy options which were retained in the proposal: (i) allow for more flexibility regarding the frequency and timing of publication of periodical financial information, in particular for small and medium-sized issuers : abolish the obligation to present quarterly financial reports for all listed companies. Introducing differentiated disclosure regimes for companies listed on a regulated market according to their size was considered undesirable as such a regime would introduce double standards for the same market segment and would therefore be confusing for investors. The preferred policy option reduces compliance costs for all companies listed on regulated markets but should in particular benefit the smaller ones, reducing considerably the administrative burden linked to the publication and preparation of quarterly information. This option: \u00b7  enables the small and medium-sized issuers to redirect their resources to publish the kind of information that suits best their investors;  should reduce short term pressure on issuers and incentivise investors to adopt a longer term vision. It should not have negative impact on investor protection, which is already sufficiently guaranteed through the mandatory disclosure of half yearly and yearly financial results, as well as through the disclosures required by the Market Abuse and Prospectus Directives; (ii) simplify the narrative parts of financial reports for small and medium-sized issuers : require ESMA to prepare non binding guidance (templates) on narrative content of the financial reports for all listed companies. This option allows for cost savings and improves comparability of information for investors. It also increases the cross-border visibility of the small and medium-sized issuers; (iii) eliminate the gaps in requirements for notification concerning major holdings of voting rights: extend the disclosure regime to all instruments of similar economic effect to holding of shares and entitlements to acquire shares. This option captures cash settled derivatives as well as any future similar financial instruments and closes a gap in the existing disclosure regime. It has a strong positive impact on investor protection and market confidence as it discourages secret stock building in listed companies; (iv) eliminate divergences in notification requirements for major holdings : harmonise the regime for the disclosure of major holdings of voting rights by requiring the aggregation of holdings of shares with those of financial instruments giving access to shares (including the cash settled derivatives). This option creates a uniform approach, reduces legal uncertainty, enhances transparency, simplifies cross-border investments and reduces its costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 and Article 114. CONTENT: the proposal contains the following provisions: Choice of the home Member State for third country issuers : the Transparency Directive is currently unclear with regard to which country is the home Member State for issuers who have to choose their home Member State but who have not done so. It is important that the Transparency Directive does not provide for any possibility to implement the rules in such a way that a listed company can operate without being under the supervision of any Member State. Therefore, a default home Member State is established for third country issuers who have not chosen their home Member State in accordance with Article 2(1) (i) during a period of three months. The requirement to publish interim management statements and/ or quarterly reports is abolished for all listed companies . The publication of such information is not considered necessary for investor protection and should therefore be left to the market in order to eliminate unnecessary administrative burden. For the sake of efficiency and in order to provide for a harmonised regime for disclosure, Member States should not continue to impose such an obligation in their national legislation. Currently, many Member States impose stricter disclosure requirements than the minimum foreseen in the Directive. In order to ensure that all listed companies in the EU benefit from equal treatment and that the administrative burden is effectively reduced, Member States should be prevented from gold plating and should not require more than what is necessary for investor protection. Broad definition of financial instruments subject to notification requirement . In order to take account of financial innovation and ensure that issuers and investors have full knowledge of the structure of corporate ownership, the definition of financial instrument should be broadened to cover all instruments of similar economic effect to holdings of shares and entitlements to acquire shares, whether giving right to a physical settlement or not. Currently, the Transparency Directive does not require notification of certain types of financial instruments that do not give the right to acquire voting rights, but which can be used to build secret stakes in listed companies without being disclosed to the market. Greater harmonisation for notification of major holdings - aggregation of holdings of shares with holdings of financial instruments . The Transparency Directive does not require aggregation of holdings of voting rights with holdings of financial instruments to calculate the thresholds for notification of major holdings. Member States have adopted different approaches in this field, resulting in a fragmented market and additional costs for cross-border investors. Holdings of shares need to be aggregated with the holdings of financial instruments for the calculation of notification thresholds. Netting of long and short positions should not be allowed. The notification should include the breakdown by type of financial instruments held to provide the market with detailed information on the nature of the holdings. However, in order to take into account the differences in ownership concentration, Member States should continue to be allowed to set lower national thresholds for notification of major holdings than those provided in the Transparency Directive where this is necessary to ensure appropriate transparency of holdings. Storage of regulated information : access to financial information on listed companies on a pan-European basis is currently burdensome. Interested parties need to go through 27 different national databases in order to search for information. In order to facilitate cross-border access to regulated information, the current network of officially appointed storage mechanisms should be enhanced. It is proposed that the Commission receives further delegated powers in this respect, in particular regarding the access to regulated information at the Union level. ESMA should assist the European Commission by developing draft regulatory technical standards concerning, for example, the operation of a central access point for the search of regulated information at the Union level. These measures should also be used to prepare the possible future creation of a single European storage mechanism ensuring storage of regulated information at the Union level. Reporting of payments to governments : the Commission has publicly expressed support for the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), and envisaged willingness to present legislation mandating disclosure requirements for extractive industry companies. Furthermore, the European Parliament has adopted a Resolution reiterating its support for country-by-country reporting requirements, in particular for the extractive industries. EU legislation does not currently require issuers to disclose, on a country basis, payments to governments made in countries where they operate. In order to make governments accountable for the use of these resources and promote good governance, it is proposed to require the disclosure of payments to governments at the individual or consolidated level of a company. The Transparency Directive requires issuers to disclose payments to governments by referring to the relevant provisions of Directive 2011/../EU Council on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings which provides for the detailed requirements in this respect. This proposal is comparable to the US Dodd-Frank Act, which was adopted in July 2010, and requires extractive industry companies (oil, gas and mining companies) registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to publicly report payments to government son a country- and project-specific basis. Sanctions and investigation : the sanctioning powers of competent authorities are enhanced. In particular, the publication of sanctions is important to improve transparency and to maintain confidence in the financial markets. Sanctions should normally be published, except in certain well-defined circumstances. In addition, the competent authorities in the Member States should have the power to suspend the exercise of voting rights of the issuer who had breached the notification rules on major holdings, as this is the most efficient sanction to prevent a breach of these rules. In order to ensure consistent application of sanctions, uniform criteria should be set for determining the actual sanction applicable to a person or a company. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}]}

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the start of the third trading period (2013-2020), the EU ETS was characterised by a large imbalance between supply and demand of allowances, resulting in a surplus of around 2 billion allowances that is expected to grow over the coming years to more than 2.6 billion allowances by 2020. The reason for this imbalance is primarily a mismatch between the auction supply of emission allowances, which is fixed in a very rigid manner, and demand for them, which is flexible and impacted by economic cycles, fossil fuel prices as well as other drivers. Weakened demand usually goes together with decreasing supply. However, in the EU carbon market this is not the case for auction supply in the current regulatory regime. The EU ETS was set up to deliver EU emissions reduction goals in a harmonised and cost- effective manner. While the environmental objective is guaranteed by the cap, the presence of a large surplus reduces the incentives for low-carbon investment and has a negative effect on the cost-efficiency of the system. In short, if not addressed, these imbalances will profoundly affect the ability of the EU ETS to meet the ETS target in future phases in a cost- effective manner. The Commission report on the state of the European carbon market in 2102 identified the need for measures to tackle structural supply-demand imbalances. This imbalance is expected to continue, and would not be sufficiently addressed by adapting the linear trajectory to a more stringent target within this framework. A change in the linear factor only changes gradually the cap. Accordingly, the surplus would also only gradually decline, such that the market would have to continue to operate for more than a decade with a surplus of around 2 billion allowances or more. In order to address this problem and to make the European Emission Trading System more resilient to imbalances, a market stability reserve should be established. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment shows that :(i) the establishment of a market stability reserve could help address the current imbalances; (ii) such a reserve would make the ETS more resilient to any potential future large-scale event that may severely disturb the supply-demand balance; (iii) operating the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation has the advantage of capturing changes in demand. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a market stability reserve for the EU ETS, as part of the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies. This market stability reserve will operate as of phase 4 starting in 2021 to provide market participants with the necessary certainty as regards the auction supply during phase 3 and an appropriate lead-time for the introduction of the reserve. To ensure predictability, the market stability reserve is designed as an objective and rule- based mechanism on the basis of which the auction volumes are adjusted in an \"automatic manner\" under pre-defined conditions Market stability reserve : the market stability reserve functions by triggering adjustments to annual auction volumes in situations where the total number of allowances in circulation is outside a certain predefined range: \u00b7 adding allowances to the reserve by deducting them from future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary surplus in the EU ETS if the total surplus is higher than 833 million allowances; \u00b7 releasing allowances from the reserve and adding them to future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary deficit in the EU ETS provided the total surplus is below 400 million allowances. Allowances are thus placed in and released from the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation. To ensure predictability and more gradual changes to the market stability reserve, a pre- defined volume of 100 million allowances per year would be released from the reserve where the conditions are met. This quantity represents roughly 5% of the current annual emissions in the EU ETS which based on historical experience should be sufficient to cater for even very sudden and strong increases in demand. The proposal also contains provisions aimed at smoothening auctioning supply in the years around transitions between trading phases in cases where the default would otherwise have resulted in sharp changes. If the volume of allowances that should be auctioned in the last year of the period exceeds the average amount to be auctioned in the two following years by more than 30%, this difference will be evenly distributed over these years. This provision builds on the experience gained in the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 of the EU ETS."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 89/105/EEC relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems was adopted so as to remove distortions to intra-Community trade in medicinal products. Directive 89/105/EEC has never been amended since its adoption. Its provisions reflect the pharmaceutical market conditions which prevailed more than twenty years ago. However, these conditions have fundamentally changed, for instance with the emergence of generic medicines providing cheaper versions of existing products or the development of increasingly innovative (yet often expensive) research-based medicinal products. In parallel, the constant rise in public expenditure on pharmaceuticals in the last decades has encouraged Member States to devise more complex and innovative pricing and reimbursement systems over time. Despite the historically positive impact of Directive 89/105/EEC on the internal market for medicines, there is evidence that it does not fully achieve its objectives in the present context: (1) A gap has emerged between the provisions of the Directive, which describe the main types of pricing and reimbursement procedures established in the 1980s, and the much wider range of cost-containment measures adopted nowadays by Member States. Despite the extensive interpretation of the Directive by the Court of Justice, the implementation of its provisions in national law and the effective enforcement of its principles, in particular by the Commission, have become particularly challenging. This situation not only results in legal uncertainties but also in a reduced transparency of national pricing and reimbursement measures, which negatively affects the smooth functioning of the internal market to the detriment of European patients and pharmaceutical companies. (2) The time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions established by Directive 89/105/EEC are regularly exceeded by Member States. This leads to delays in the marketing of medicinal products, which in turn slows down the availability of valuable treatments for patients. In order to take into account the evolution of the pharmaceutical market and of national policies to control public expenditure on medicines, substantive changes are necessary to all major provisions of Directive 89/105/EEC. Therefore, in the interest of clarity, Directive 89/105/EEC should be replaced. The fundamental objectives and principles of Directive 89/105/EEC remain fully valid in the present context. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal to revise the Directive is based on the combination of options recommended in the framework of the impact assessment, namely: to ensure timely pricing and reimbursement decisions : options A.3/c (regular reports on pricing and reimbursement approval times), A.4/a (shorter time-limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions concerning generic medicinal products) and A.4/b (prohibition of patent linkage and re-assessment of safety features); to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Directive in the current context : options B.3/b (extensive revision of the Directive to clarify its scope and wording) and B.4 (notification of draft national measures to facilitate enforcement). The possible extension of the Directive to include medical devices was examined in the impact assessment but discarded due to the specificities of this market. Furthermore, in spite of the difficulty to conclude on the overall cost-benefit balance of reducing the time limits with respect to originator medicines, a reduction from the current 90/180 days to 60/120 days is proposed in light of the positive impact it would have on the swift availability of innovative medicines to patients and on rewarding pharmaceutical innovation when medicines are approved for reimbursement. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he overall objective of the proposal is to clarify the procedural obligations incumbent upon Member State and to ensure the effectiveness of the Directive, both in avoiding delays in pricing and reimbursement decisions and in preventing barriers to pharmaceutical trade. This shall be done without affecting national social security policies, except as far as it is necessary to achieve the transparency of national procedures and the effectiveness of the internal market legislation. The proposal maintains the core principles of the existing Directive but also puts forward a comprehensive adaptation of its legal provisions based on the following key elements: Clarification of the scope of the Directive : the transparency requirements apply to all pricing and reimbursement measures understood in a broad sense, including \u201cdemand side\u201d measures to control or promote the prescription of specific medicines. Nevertheless, measures involving public procurement and voluntary contractual agreements with individual companies are excluded from the scope of the Directive in order to avoid interference with other bodies of law. Comprehensive coverage of national measures and legal clarity : the provisions of the Directive are reworded in accordance with general principles (rather than on the basis of specific national procedures) and incorporate the case-law of the Court of Justice. Several key provisions are clarified and updated to avoid interpretation controversies. In particular, it is made clear that the time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions include all procedural steps leading to the decision, including health technology assessments where applicable. Adaptation of the time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions : the time limits applicable to generic medicines are reduced to 15/30 days when the reference product has already been priced and included in the health insurance system. The time limits applicable to all other medicinal products are reduced to 60/120 days. However, in cases where national authorities subject medicinal products to health technology assessment procedures in order to assess the relative efficacy or the short- and long-term effectiveness, as an integral part of their decision-making process, the time-limits shall be 90/180 days. Non-interference of patent and safety issues with pricing and reimbursement procedures : the proposal clarifies that intellectual property rights should not interfere with pricing and reimbursement procedures, as is already the case for marketing authorisation procedures. In addition, elements already assessed in the framework of the marketing authorisation process (quality, safety and efficacy, including bioequivalence) may not be reassessed in the framework of pricing and reimbursement procedures. Dialogue and enforcement tools : different instruments are put in place to facilitate dialogue on the implementation of the Directive and to ensure its effective enforcement (consultation on draft measures at national level and pre-notification to the Commission, the creation of a remedies procedure in case of non-compliance with the time-limits related to the inclusion of medicinal products in health insurance systems). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the C ommission's proposal has no impact on the European Union budget beyond what is already foreseen for the years to come in the Multiannual Financial Framework. Total appropriations under headings 1 to 5 of the multiannual financial framework are estimated at EUR 0.859 million (2014); EUR 1.293 million (2015); EUR 1.143 million (2016-2017); EUR 1.093 (2018 action continued)."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this Commission proposal concerns the review of the list of priority substances (PS) in the field of water policy, i.e. the chemicals identified among those presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment at EU level which are listed in Annex X to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC. The revision takes place following the review of priority substances required by both the WFD and the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (EQSD) 2008/105/EC. In the course of reviewing the priority substances list, improvements in the functioning of the EQSD were identified, as well as a mechanism for improving the identification of additional priority substances in future reviews. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t echnical work on the review of the PS list began in 2007 and was supported by an extensive consultation with experts from the Commission services, Member States, stakeholders and the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER). As the technical work was in its final stages in 2010, work on the impact assessment began with the commencement of a study by the consultancy Entec. The Impact Assessment Board discussed the Impact Assessment report at its meeting on 22 June 2011. The comments made were addressed in the accompanying Impact Assessment report. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal is limited to the identification of priority substances and to establishing EQS at EU level. The main amendments are as follows: Amendments to Annex X of the WFD : the updated Annex X includes the newly proposed priority substances and identifies two existing priority substances as priority hazardous substances. The new list is comprised of the following: Plant protection product substances: Aclonifen, Bifenox, Cypermethrin, Dicofol, Heptachlor, Quinoxyfen Substances used in biocidal products: Cybutryne, Dichlorvos, Terbutryn Industrial chemicals: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) Combustion by-products: Dioxin and Dioxin-Like PCBs Pharmaceutical substances: 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), Diclofenac. Amendments to EQSD : the main amendments are as follows: New Annex for priority substances and biota : Part A of Annex I is replaced by Annex II to this Directive. The latter introduces the newly proposed priority substances, amends the EQS for some of the existing priority substances and introduces a column for biota standards. This latter column includes the three biota standards that were already established by EQSD as well as biota standards for some other existing priority substances and some new priority substances. Listing the biota standards in Annex I of the EQSD simplifies presentation and improves clarity. Matrix : a definition of \u201cmatrix\u201d is introduced i.e. the environmental compartment to which the EQS apply and in which the concentrations of priority substances and priority hazard substances are therefore to be monitored: usually water, sediment or biota (fish unless otherwise stated). The text is amended to make it coherent with the new structure of Part A of Annex I (in particular with the inclusion of biota standards in the Annex), and to amend the obligations of Member States as regards the selection of the matrix for monitoring. A default monitoring matrix is specified for each substance, on the basis of its intrinsic properties. The existing flexibility for Member States to choose an alternative matrix is retained, but it is now conditional on the fulfilment of the minimum analytical performance criteria in Article 4 of Commission Directive 2009/90/EC11. Notification : the notification obligations set out in the EQSD are integrated into the reporting of the river basin management plans under the WFD. Comitology : the comitology mandate to amend paragraph 3 of Part B of Annex I is aligned to the new delegated powers under Article 290 of the Treaty. Furthermore, changes are made to the text to align it with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on Commission implementing powers. PBT substances : persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs) and other substances that behave like PBTs may be found for decades in the aquatic environment at levels posing a significant risk, even if extensive measures to reduce or eliminate emissions have already been taken. A new provision is inserted that makes specific provision for substances behaving as ubiquitous persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances. Watch list : a new provision is inserted to establish a watch list for the targeted collection of monitoring data to support future reviews of the priority substances list. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal contains no budgetary implications."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown \u2013 on a cross-sector scale \u2013 certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the \u201cNew Legislative Framework\u201d was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits is presented in the framework of the implementation of the \u201cgoods package\u201d adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 \u2013 No changes to the current situation; Option 2 \u2013 Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 \u2013 Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The changes made to the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC concern: the definitions, the obligations of economic operators, the presumption of conformity provided by harmonised standards, the declaration of conformity, CE marking, the safeguard clause procedure and the conformity assessment procedures. The proposal does not change the scope and the safety objectives of Directive 2006/95. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the materials are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the electrical equipment bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2006/95/EC on the placing on the market of electrical equipment has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their electrical material complies with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when non-compliant electrical equipment is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC does not specify how volumes of greenhouse gas emission allowances to be auctioned are to be distributed over the trading period. One of the features of the change from the phase 2 (period from 2008 to 2012) into phase 3 (period from 2013 to 2020) and the implementation provisions adopted so far is that the supply of allowances and international credits is expected to temporarily increase significantly in the short term. This exacerbates the already significant, unforeseen impact of the macro-economic developments, due to which emissions have decreased considerably and are not expected to increase significantly in 2012 and 2013. This combination of increased net supply and reduced demand increasingly affects the orderly functioning of the European carbon market in the transition to phase 3. In the light of such exceptional circumstances, the Commission is currently reviewing the need for a further change of the auctioning timetable and will invite experts in the Climate Change Committee to consider a draft for a future amendment to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 and indicate their view on the appropriate action to be taken before the end of this year. The Commission also invites any other interested stakeholders to express their views on this draft and will actively engage with them in this regard. Meanwhile, the legislative process to clarify the scope of the Commission's powers by means of the present proposal should proceed swiftly and independently of the result of consultations with the Climate Change Committee. Finally, the Commission reaffirms its commitment, as stated in the context of the agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive, to urgently examine and present options for action with a view to adopting further appropriate structural measures to strengthen the ETS during phase 3, and make it more effective. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: for the purposes of legal certainty, it should be clarified that, in order to ensure an orderly functioning of the market, the Commission is able to adapt the auction timetable laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. The proposed amendment would expressly provide such clarification in the relevant provision of the EU ETS Directive.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States \u2013 with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom \u2013 and also by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Regulation is part of the EU\u2019s common visa policy for short stays of 90 days in any 180-day period. Kosovo is currently listed in Annex I, Part 2 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 , i.e. among those entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as states by at least one Member State. Persons from those entities are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. Since launching the visa dialogue in January 2012, the Commission has presented regular reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on its assessment of Kosovo\u2019s fulfilment of the requirements of the roadmap which identified all the legislation and other measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. In its last report, the Commission set out recommendations corresponding to outstanding requirements of the visa roadmap, including four key priorities. It noted the border/boundary delineation agreement with Montenegro should be ratified by Kosovo before visa free status is granted to persons from Kosovo. In its latest report, the Commission observed that Kosovo had taken important steps towards fulfilling the requirement of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and fulfilled sufficient elements of building up its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Based on this assessment and given the outcome of the continuous monitoring and reporting that had been carried out since the launch of the visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo, the Commission confirms that Kosovo has met the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap on the understanding that by the day of the adoption of this proposal by the European Parliament and the Council, Kosovo will have ratified the border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. CONTENT: taking account of all the criteria which should be considered when determining on a case-by-case basis the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (as introduced by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014), the Commission has decided to present a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Kosovo from Annex I, Part 2 (visa-required list) to Annex II, Part 4 (visa-free list). A footnote will be added specifying that the visa exemption will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents (Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004). Territorial provisions : the proposed regulation will constitute a development of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and shall not be bound by it or subject to its application. The amended Regulation will be directly applicable from the date of its entry into force and will be implemented immediately by Member States. No implementation plan is necessary. The Commission will continue to actively monitor Kosovo\u2019s process of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and the development of its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. (*) This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Initiative of Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria, Portugal, Romania, Finland and Sweden for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 November 2000 the Council, in accordance with the Tampere Conclusions, adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. Mutual recognition can only operate effectively in a spirit of confidence, whereby not only judicial authorities, but all actors in the criminal process see decisions of the judicial authorities of other Member States as equivalent to their own, implying not only trust in the adequacy of one's partners' rules, but also trust that those rules are correctly applied. Although all Member States are parties to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), experience has shown that this in itself does not always provide a sufficient degree of trust in the criminal justice systems of other Member States. Common minimum rules should lead to increased confidence in the criminal justice systems of all Member States, which in turn should lead to more efficient judicial cooperation in a climate of mutual trust. Such common minimum rules should be applied in the fields of interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in view of the step-by-step approach set out in the Roadmap, the Commission presented on 8 July 2009 a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the right to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings. This proposal was accompanied by an Impact Assessment. This impact assessment is re-submitted as \"detailed statement\" allowing to appraise compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, in view of the presentation by Member States of an initiative for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the rights to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings. Five options are set out as follows: \u00b7 Option 1 : status quo; \u00b7 Option 2 : adoption of non-legislative measures (such as recommendations) to exchange best practices and to establish Community guidelines; \u00b7 Option 3 : new instrument covering all rights; \u00b7 Option 4 : legislative measures restricted to the cross-border cases; \u00b7 Option 5 : step-by-step approach beginning with legislative measures on access to interpretation and translation services (withdrawing the current proposal for a Framework Decision and proposing a new Framework Decision requiring Member States to provide minimum standards only for access to interpretation and translation services). Option 5 could provide scope for a longer term action plan for the progressive approximation of laws in the area of procedural rights taking account of practical aspects either. This approach would not be as dependent on the Lisbon Treaty as option 3. This option would result in an improvement in the quality and provision of interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. It would ensure a fairer trial in cases where the suspect does not understand the criminal proceedings, his rights or the full charges before him. The option would place an additional financial and administrative burden on Member States that currently do not offer training to legal interpreters and translators. CONTENT: the proposal lays down rules concerning the rights to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings and proceedings for the execution of a European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Those rights apply to any person from the time that person is made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State that he is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings, which is understood to mean the final determination of the question whether the suspected or accused person has committed the offence. The Directive will not apply to proceedings which may lead to sanctions being imposed by an authority other than a criminal court, as long as those proceedings are not pending before a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters. Right to interpretation : a suspected or accused person who does not understand or speak the language of the criminal proceedings concerned must be provided with interpretation into his native language or into another language that he understands, in order to safeguard his right to fair proceedings. Interpretation, including of communications between the suspected or accused person and his legal counsel, shall be provided during criminal proceedings before investigative and judicial authorities, including during police questioning, during all court hearings and during any necessary interim hearings, and may be provided in other situations. This provision will not affect rules of national law concerning the presence of a legal counsel during any stage of the criminal proceedings. A person with a hearing impediment must receive interpretation assistance, if appropriate for that person. Member States must ensure that it is verified in any appropriate manner, including by consulting the suspected or accused person, whether he understands and speaks the language of the criminal proceedings and needs the assistance of an interpreter. At some stage in the proceedings, in accordance with national law, there must be the possibility of a review of a finding that there is no need for interpretation. Such review does not entail the obligation for Member States to provide for a separate mechanism in which the sole ground for review is the challenging of such finding. In proceedings for the execution of a EAW, the executing Member State shall ensure that its competent authorities provide any person subject to such proceedings who does not understand or speak the language of the proceedings, with interpretation. Right to translation of essential documents : a suspected or accused person who does not understand the language of the criminal proceedings concerned must be provided with a translation, into his native language or into another language that he understands, of all documents which are essential in order to safeguard his right to fair proceedings, or at least the important passages of such documents, provided that the person concerned has the right of access to the documents concerned under national law. The competent authorities must decide which the essential documents to be translated are. The latter must include at least detention orders or equivalent decisions depriving the person of his liberty, the charge or indictment and any judgment, where such documents exist. The suspected person may submit a reasoned request for translation of further documents which are necessary for the effective exercise of the right of defence. There must be the possibility of a review if translation of a document referred to above is not provided. Such review does not entail the obligation for Member States to provide for a separate mechanism in which the sole ground for review is the challenging of such finding. In proceedings for the execution of an EAW, the executing Member State shall ensure that its competent authorities provide any person subject to such proceedings who does not understand the language in which the European Arrest Warrant is drawn up, or into which it has been translated by the issuing Member State, with a translation of that document. Provided that this does not affect the fairness of the proceedings, an oral translation or an oral summary of the documents may be provided instead of a written translation. A person who has a right to translation of documents may, at any time, waive this right. Costs : Member States shall cover the costs of interpretation and translation resulting from the application of the above provisions, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings. Quality of the interpretation and translation : concrete measures must be taken to ensure that the interpretation and translation provided shall be of adequate quality so that the suspected or accused person, as well as a person subject to the execution of a EAW, is fully able to exercise his rights. Non-regression clause : it should be ensured that setting common minimum standards in accordance with this Directive does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the standards set in the ECHR or other relevant international agreements are maintained. Member States remain entirely at liberty to set standards higher than those agreed in this Directive."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 established a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat stocks in the Baltic Sea. The objective of the plan is to ensure that the exploitation of the stocks concerned restores and maintains populations of these stocks above the levels that achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The scientific evaluation of the Bothnian Sea herring stock and the Bothnian Bay herring stock conducted in 2017 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) showed that those two stocks are similar. As a consequence, ICES combined the two stocks into one, changed the boundaries of its geographic distribution area and re-estimated the MSY fishing mortality ranges, as well as the relevant conservation reference points. Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 provides that where, on the basis of scientific advice, the Commission considers that the conservation reference points set out in Annex II to that Regulation no longer correctly express the objectives of the plan, those points, as a matter of urgency, may be submitted for the revision to the European Parliament and the Council. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to urgently amend Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 to ensure that the fishing opportunities for Gulf of Bothnia herring stocks are determined in accordance with the updated conservation reference points following the scientific evaluation carried out by ICES."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (repealing Council Directive 87/357/EEC and Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the free movement of safe consumer products is one of the cornerstones of the European Union. Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety (GPSD) lays down the requirement that consumer products must be safe and that Member States' market surveillance authorities must take action against dangerous products as well as exchange information to that effect through the Community rapid information exchange system RAPEX. Overlaps of market surveillance rules and obligations of economic operators laid down in various pieces of Union legislation (the GPSD, the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that also covers consumer products) has led to confusion on the part of both economic operators and national authorities and has seriously hampered the effectiveness of market surveillance activity in the Union. The Commission considers that Directive 2001/95/EC needs to be fundamentally revised to improve its functioning and to ensure consistency with developments in Union legislation as regards market surveillance, obligations of economic operators and standardisation. In the interest of clarity, Directive 2001/95/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation. The proposal is part of the \"Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package\" which also includes a proposal for a single market surveillance regulation and a multiannual action plan for market surveillance covering the period 2013-2015. The Single Market Act II, adopted in 2012, confirms the \"Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package\" as a key action to improve the safety of products circulating in the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment prepared by the Commission thus covers aspects related to both this proposal and the proposal for a new Market Surveillance Regulation. The Commission's Impact Assessment Board delivered a favourable opinion in September 2012. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation on consumer product safety, which will replace Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety (GPSD), concerns manufactured non-food consumer products. It aims at clarifying the regulatory framework for consumer products taking into account legislative developments in recent years. Like the GPSD, the proposed Regulation requires that consumer products must be \"safe\", sets certain obligations on economic operators and contains provisions for the development of standards in support of the general safety requirement. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : the proposed Regulation clearly delimits its scope of application compared to sectoral Union harmonisation legislation. Whilst the general principle that all non-food consumer products must be safe applies across the board, the more detailed obligations on economic operators only apply to those operators that are not subject to corresponding obligations laid down in harmonising legislation covering a specific product sector. The definitions section has been updated and, where applicable aligned with the New Legislative Framework for the Marketing of Products. General safety requirement and obligations of economic operators : the general requirement, laid down already in the GPSD, that all consumer products must be safe when placed or made available on the Union market has been kept. However, its operation in practice will be significantly simplified due to the introduction of a clear link with sector-specific legislation and a simplification of the rules on standards. On the basis of Decision No 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products, the proposal: lays down the elementary obligations of economic operators (manufacturers, importers, distributors) involved in the supply chain of consumer products insofar as they are not subject to corresponding requirements under sector specific Union harmonisation legislation. These obligations concern issues related to labelling, product identification, corrective actions to be taken in case of unsafe products and information of the competent authorities; requires economic operators to be able to identify the operators who supplied them with the product and to whom they supplied it. Where justified due to the risks inherent to specific types of products, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures requiring economic operators to establish or adhere to an electronic traceability system. Use of European standards : like the GPSD, also the proposal for the new Regulation favours the use of standards in support of the implementation of the general safety requirement. However, the process to identify existing European standards or to ask for the development of European standards that would give rise to presume that a product is safe has been significantly simplified and aligned to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that sets a new overarching framework for European standardisation. Market surveillance and RAPEX : the provisions regarding market surveillance and RAPEX that are currently contained in the GPSD have been transferred to the proposal for a new single Market Surveillance Regulation. That new Regulation would produce a one-tier system in which all market surveillance rules are brought together in a single instrument and in which RAPEX will be the single alert system regarding products presenting a risk. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal does not have other budgetary implications than those related to the proper management of the Regulation which, in form of the GPSD, is already part of the Union law acquis. The budgetary implications are already foreseen in the existing or proposed programmes and respect the Commission proposal for the new multiannual financial framework. According to the financial statement, the total appropriations (operational appropriations, human resources and administrative expenditure) amount to EUR 12 019 million in commitments for 2015-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is to ensure an exploitation of living biological resources that is sustainable economically, environmentally and socially. The Union has been a contracting party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) since 14 November 1997. ICCAT has the authority to adopt recommendations on the conservation and management of the fisheries under its competence, which are binding on the contracting parties. As part of the measures to regulate bluefin tuna stocks and to improve the quality and reliability of statistical data, and in order to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing, ICCAT adopted a recommendation introducing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme (BCD) and a recommendation developing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme by introducing a mandatory electronic document system (eBCD). The purpose of this proposal is to transpose and implement existing ICCAT measures, which are binding upon the contracting parties. CONTENT: this proposal establishes a Union bluefin tuna catch documentation programme to implement the conservation and management measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas relating to bluefin tuna catch documentation programme and the mandatory use of the electronic bluefin tuna catch documentation system with a view to identifying the origin of all bluefin tuna. Specifically, the proposal: - lays down general provisions on the use of bluefin catch and re-export certificates and sets rules for the recording and validation of catch and subsequent trade events of bluefin tuna. Particular rules are set for tagged fish; - introduces additional provisions on verification before validation, transmission of data from eBCD users, the use of paper eBCD in exceptional cases and annual reporting to ICCAT; - sets out a detailed list of cases where delegated powers are requested to address frequent changes to the recommendations adopted by ICCAT."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the years preceding the crisis, low financing costs fuelled misallocation of resources, often to less productive uses, feeding unsustainable levels of consumption, housing bubbles and accumulation of external and internal debt in some Member States. The emergence of large macroeconomic imbalances, including wide and persistent divergences in competitiveness trends, proved highly damaging to the European Union, and in particular to the euro, when the crisis struck. It is therefore important to develop a new structured procedure for prevention and correction of adverse macroeconomic imbalances in every Member State. In its Communication and report on \u00ab EMU@10: successes and challenges after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union \u201d the Commission stressed, in particular, the need to broaden economic surveillance in order to detect and address macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage. The Europe 2020 strategy calls for the development of a specific policy framework for the euro area to tackle broader macroeconomic imbalances. Overall, the Task Force on economic governance, chaired by the President of the European Council, agreed that macroeconomic surveillance should function alongside the budget surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact. This proposal is part of legislative package comprising six texts which seeks to strengthen the pact by improving its provisions in the light of experience, not least of the crisis: 1) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1466/97); 2) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1467/97); 3) A Regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area; 4) A new Council Directive on requirements for the budgetary framework of the Member States; 5) A new Regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; 6) A Regulation on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is proposing a mechanism for the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances which is made up of two draft proposals for regulations. The first proposal sketches out the excessive imbalance procedure (EIP), while this proposal focuses on the associated enforcement measures. The second proposal specifies that if a Member State repeatedly fails to act on Council recommendations to address excessive macroeconomic imbalances, it will have to pay a yearly fine equal to 0.1% of its GDP. As a rule, the Commission will propose the maximum amount of the fine provided for and this proposal will be considered adopted, unless the Council decides to the contrary by qualified majority within ten days of the Commission adopting its proposal (\u201creverse voting\u201d). The Council may amend the Commission proposal by acting unanimously. The Council may decide, on the basis of a Commission proposal, to cancel or to reduce the fine. The Commission could make a proposal to this end following assessment of a reasoned request by the Member State and this would reverse the burden of proof for application of the sanction. Furthermore, the Commission could also make a proposal to the same end on the basis of exceptional economic circumstances. Council decisions concerning such fines will be made only by the members representing Member States whose currency is the euro. The vote of the member of the Council representing the Member State concerned by the decisions will not be taken into account. The fines provided for in this proposal for a regulation constitute other revenue, as referred to in Article 311 of the Treaty. In line with the practice established in the corrective part of the SGP (Regulation 'EC) No 1467/97), this revenue will be distributed between Member States whose currency is the euro and which are not involved in an excessive imbalance procedure and not involved in an excessive deficit procedure, in proportion to their share of the total GNI of the eligible Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a new regulatory framework to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medical devices. At the same time, it sets high standards of quality and safety for medical devices in order to meet common safety concerns as regards such devices. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 significantly reinforces key elements of the existing regulatory approach in Council Directive 90/385/EEC and Council Directive 93/42/EEC, such as the supervision of notified bodies, conformity assessment procedures, clinical investigations and clinical evaluation, vigilance and market surveillance, whilst introducing provisions ensuring transparency and traceability regarding medical devices, to improve health and safety. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting public health crisis represent an unprecedented challenge for Member States and a heavy burden for national authorities, health care institutions and economic operators. The coronavirus crisis has created exceptional circumstances that require considerable additional resources and increased availability of vitally important medical devices such as medical gloves, surgical masks or intensive care equipment. None of these measures could reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation. These extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore very likely that Member States, health care institutions, economic operators and other stakeholders would not have been able to ensure its proper implementation and application from the date of application initially foreseen on 26 May 2020. CONTENT: for exceptional reasons, in the current context of the coronavirus epidemic, the Commission proposes to defer by one year, to 26 May 2021, the date of application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 which should have applied from 26 May 2020. The proposed amendment aims to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, namely the establishment of a rigorous, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for medical devices that ensures a high level of protection of public health and patient safety and the proper functioning of the internal market for these devices. At the same time, it is proposed to defer the date of repeal of Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices and Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices by one year. These postponements would ensure that an operational regulatory framework for medical devices would be in place from 26 May 2020. In addition, the proposed amendment aims to ensure that, in exceptional cases, the Commission may adopt, as soon as possible, EU-wide derogations following national derogations, in order to effectively address potential shortages of vitally important medical devices in the EU. In view of the urgent need to respond immediately to the public health crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed amending Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 1999/32/EC has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 1999/32/EC of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EEC. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive seeks to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment. This Directive lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the Union. With regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, the proposal provides for: (i) derogations in Member States and regions where the environmental conditions allow; (ii) derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down in Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. To recall, in 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL), containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010. In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in the Union, the codified Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL."}]}

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is a global leader in environmental protection and climate action. The Commission considers the shift towards a clean, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy to be a priority. The programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE), established by Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 for the period 2014 to 2020, is the latest in a series of Union programmes over 25 years which support the implementation of environmental and climate legislation and policy priorities. Through its catalytic role, the programme supports small scale actions intended to initiate, expand or promote sustainable production, distribution and consumption practices, as well as to protect natural heritage. The Commission considers that this approach should be continued in the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. An enhanced LIFE programme would play an important role in developing climate action and clean energy investments across Europe. It would also help the EU meet its climate objectives and commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States \u2013 seeks to establish the environment and climate action programme (LIFE). It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, as well as the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Programme objectives : the proposed programme aims to achieve the Union\u2019s objectives as set out in international environmental, climate and clean energy legislation, policy, plans and commitments. Its overall objective is to contribute to the shift towards: a clean, circular, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, including a transition to clean energy; protecting and improving the quality of the environment; halting and reversing biodiversity loss, including in marine ecosystems, so as to contribute to sustainable development. In particular, the new LIFE programme shall: mobilise investment and support energy efficiency activities, particularly in European regions lagging behind in the shift towards clean energy; support projects promoting best practice in relation to nature protection and biodiversity, as well as \u2018strategic nature protection projects\u2019 for all Member States, including measures to protect the marine environment; contribute to the transition to a circular economy model through financial support targeting a variety of actors (businesses, public authorities and consumers), in particular by applying, developing, and replicating best technology, practices and solutions tailored to specific local, regional or national contexts, including through integrated approaches for the implementation of waste management and prevention plans; support the other aspects of the Union's environment policy, such as the protection and improvement of air and water quality in the EU, implementing the 2030 climate and energy policy framework and meeting the Union\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement. Actions taken under the programme are expected to contribute 61 % of the overall financial envelope of the programme to climate objectives. The Commission proposes to simplify the programme management procedures and allow for a wider geographical access. Synergies would be developed with the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, Horizon Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility and InvestEU. Proposed budget : EUR 5.45 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027. The indicative breakdown of this amount is as follows: Environment : EUR 3.5 billion of which: (i) EUR 2.15 billion for the Nature and Biodiversity sub-programme; (ii) EUR 1.35 billion for the Circular Economy and Quality of Life sub-programme; Climate action : EUR 1.95 billion of which: (i) EUR 950 million for the sub-programme Climate change mitigation and adaptation; (ii) EUR 1 billion for the sub-programme clean energy transition."}]}

This agreement allowed for reciprocal access between those three countries to fish up to 4 nautical miles from their respective baselines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, which are the waters between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It established that, for the purposes of such fishing, the area in question was deemed to constitute the high seas. In view of more recent developments in international fisheries law, Norway considered that the existing agreement was not in conformity with the current provisions of the Law of the Sea. Norway was particularly concerned with regard to the provisions on control. On 29 July 2009, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry formally informed the Danish authorities that they wished to terminate the Agreement with a formal denunciation. Consequently, the Agreement expired on 7 August 2012. Subsequently, Norway entered into formal negotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, with the aim of establishing a replacement Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area. This new Agreement was signed on 15 January 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden on behalf of the Union. The new Agreement: The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The withdrawal shall occur during the programming period 2014-2020 in which the United Kingdom is participating in fifteen programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal ('cooperation programmes'). Two of those programmes are programmes involving Northern Ireland and supporting peace and reconciliation and North-South cooperation under the \u2018Good Friday Agreement\u2019 that the Union intends to continue even if the United Kingdom withdraws from the Union without a withdrawal agreement having entered into force by the date the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. CONTENT: this proposal aims to ensure the continuation of two bilateral cooperation programmes involving Ireland namely: (i) the PEACE IV (Ireland-United Kingdom) programme and; (ii) the United Kingdom-Ireland (Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland) programme. Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 shall continue to apply to the cooperation programmes subject to the provisions of this Regulation. By way of derogation from Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013: - the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) hosting the managing authority and the certifying authority of the PEACE IV (Ireland-United Kingdom) and the United Kingdom - Ireland (Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland) Programmes shall continue to exercise its functions; - the Department of Finance of Northern Ireland shall remain the audit authority of these programmes. The Regulation shall apply from the date following the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. It shall not apply if a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposed Regulation has no financial implications. Both programmes shall continue to be financed from the Union\u2019s budget. The possibility to execute the necessary controls and audits in all participating regions will need to be confirmed by an agreement between the Commission and the authorities of the United Kingdom and will constitute a condition for financing."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he proposal repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial movements of pet animals into a Member State from another Member State or from third countries and the checks applicable to such movements. It aims to ensure a sufficient level of safety with regard to the public or animal health risks involved in those non-commercial movements and to remove any unjustified obstacles to such movements. (1) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 was substantially amended by Regulation (EU) No 438/2010 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals, in particular to extend the transitional regime provided for in Articles 6, 8 and 16 until 31 December 2011. In a statement annexed to Regulation (EU) No 438/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, the Commission undertook to propose a revision of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 in its entirety, and, in particular, the aspects of delegated and implementing acts. Therefore, due to the entry into force of the Treaty, the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 need to be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 of that Treaty. (2) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 also provides that as of 3 July 2011, i.e. the end of the eight-year transitional period provided for in Article 4(1) thereof, electronic identification is the only means of identifying a pet dog, cat or ferret. However, an animal bearing a clearly readable tattoo applied before that date continues to be considered identified in accordance with the Regulation. Because of the expiry of the aforementioned transitional regime and period and the need to make a number of amendments bringing the animal health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 into line with the TFEU in a sufficiently clear and accessible manner for the ordinary citizen, that Regulation should be repealed and replaced by this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and the introductory phrase and point (b) of Article 168(4) of the Treaty of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of the proposal is to repeal and replace Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by the proposed Regulation, which: aligns the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU; clarifies for the ordinary citizen the regime that will apply after the end of the transitional regime provided for in Articles 6, 8 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 and of the transitional period provided for in Article 4(1). This proposal and the proposal amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC which relates to trade in and imports of dogs, cats and ferrets should be presented together in order to be adopted simultaneously.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components for L-category vehicles and a sizeable drop in demand for those vehicles. This has led to important delays for manufacturers to clear their stock of Euro 4 vehicles that, according to Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, need to be registered before the application of the environmental Euro 5 step on 1 January 2021. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, motorcycles sales have been highly impacted. Because of Member States authorities\u2019 lockdowns, sales could not take place during the peak season. According to industry sources, it is estimated that around 553 700 Euro 4 vehicles were in stock in March 2020. During the lockdowns, sales went down by 98% and remained sluggish since then. It is therefore likely that not all Euro 4 vehicles currently in stock will be sold by the end of the year. The end-of-series provisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 allow manufacturers to continue to make available on the market, register or enter into service a limited part of a stock of L-category vehicles which cannot be made available on the market or can no longer be made available on the market, owing to the entry into force of new technical requirements against which those vehicles have not been approved. Considering the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is apparent that the provisions on end-of-series do not constitute an appropriate mechanism to address the amount of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that manufacturers will have in stock following the application of the environmental Euro 5 step. CONTENT: in the context of the current COVID-19 epidemic, the main purpose of the proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 is to adapt the provisions relating to the number of end-of-series vehicles in order to allow dealers to sell higher amounts of their stock of Euro 4 vehicles in 2021 only. In order to ensure that the application of these measures is restricted to vehicles that were in stock at the moment of the national lockdowns, the amount of vehicles benefiting from these specific end-of-series measures shall not exceed the number of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that were in stock on 15 March 2020. This proposal: - shall not increase pollutant emissions as the flexibility shall be limited to already produced vehicles at the time of the lockdown; - avoid the need to unnecessarily scrap vehicles that would have been otherwise placed on the market in absence of the crisis; - shall not postpone the entry into force of the Euro 5 step for all newly produced vehicles on 1 January 2021."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: in view of the fact that since it was adopted on 30 January 2006, Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been the subject of several amendments, it is proposed that it be recast in the interests of clarity. Furthermore, changes in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation that have occurred since it was adopted, make it necessary to modify certain provisions and to restructure the legislative text so that it reflects more effectively the reality of the POSEI agricultural scheme. The main amendments are as follows: Subject: the Regulation lays down specific measures for agriculture to mitigate the difficulties caused by extreme remoteness, specifically remoteness, isolation, small surface areas, terrain, difficult climate and economic dependence on a limited number of products of the outermost regions. Objectives: the proposal is more explicit in setting out the scheme\u2019s main objectives: The specific measures shall help to meet the following objectives: guaranteed supply to the outermost regions of products essential for human consumption or for processing and as agricultural inputs by mitigating the additional costs due to extreme remoteness; preservation and development of agricultural activities in the outermost regions, including the production, processing and the sale of local products. These objectives shall be implemented by means of the measures referred to in Chapters III, IV and V. Structure: the new structure highlights the central role played by the Programmes of Options Specifically Relating to the Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI programmes) which have now been defined for each outermost region at the most appropriate level and coordinated by the relevant Member States. These programmes relate to the two fundamental POSEI elements, namely the specific supply arrangements and the specific measures in favour of local production. POSEI : the measures provided for are defined for each outermost region by a POSEI Programme which shall comprise: a) specific supply arrangements and b) specific measures to assist local agricultural production. The POSEI programme shall be established at the geographical level which the Member State concerned deems most appropriate. It shall be prepared by the competent authorities designated by the said Member State, which shall submit it to the Commission for approval after the competent authorities and organisations at the appropriate regional level have been consulted. A single POSEI programme may be submitted for each Member State in respect of its outermost regions. Other amendments : minor amendments have been made to the wording of the Regulation, in particular: the procedure for submitting programmes and amendments for approval to the Commission has been specified to make it more consistent with current practice and in view of the need for greater flexibility and efficiency as regards the process of adapting programmes to meet the actual needs of agriculture and the supply of products essential for the outermost regions; it has been specified that the specific supply arrangements should be designed for each region in accordance with local agricultural production, the development of which should not be limited by aid for supply which is too excessive for products which are also produced locally. This provision is considered to be necessary to make it compulsory for the two POSEI instruments to be compatible with each other; the possibility of re-dispatching products which have been processed locally using basic products which have benefited from the specific supply arrangements, without the benefit being reimbursed, which was restricted to products dispatched from the Azores to Madeira or vice versa, or from Madeira to the Canary Islands or vice versa, will also now apply to the French overseas departments; in the interests of sound budgetary management, Member States must indicate in their programmes the list of aid constituting direct payments; it is also helpful to indicate how the aid amounts for measures to assist local agricultural products are defined, which was previously not indicated in the basic act; lastly, the financial allocation for each national programme selected is that which corresponds to the 2011 financial year and subsequent years. However, the ceiling for financing for the specific supply arrangements for France and Portugal has increased by 20%, in the light of the conclusions of the first report on the impact of the 2006 POSEI reform, submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in 2010.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directive 2008/95/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an increasingly competitive environment, the growing number of trade mark applications at both national and EU levels, and the growing number of trade mark users demonstrates the crucial role of trade marks in terms of market success and commercial value. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date. In its \u2018 Small Business Act \u2019 of 2008, the Commission pledged to make the Community trademark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, in its 2008 Communication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe the Commission underlined its commitment to effective and efficient trademark protection and to a trademark system of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trademark system in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) and National Offices. Lastly, in its 2011 Intellectual Property Rights Strategy for Europe, the Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a view to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it more effective, efficient and consistent overall. The Council has also called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment carried out for both the review of the Regulation and of the Directive identified two main problems: (i) the divergent provisions of the existing regulatory framework, and (ii) the low level of cooperation between trade mark offices in the Union. Four options were envisaged. \u00b7  Option 1 : no further approximation of trade mark laws and procedures; \u00b7  Option 2 : Partial expansion of the approximation of national laws and their consistency with the Community trade mark system; \u00b7  Option 3 : full approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures; \u00b7  Option 4 : a single trademark rulebook, which would replace Member States' trade mark laws in their entirety, by setting uniform rules across the Union. The impact assessment concluded that option 2 would be proportionate and would best serve to achieve the objectives pursued. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the main common objective of this proposal for recasting and of the parallel proposal for the amendment of the Regulation is to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and efficient for businesses in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and legal security. Specifically, the initiative to recast the Directive is driven by the following objectives: 1) Modernising and improving the existing provisions of the Directive. This will be achieved by amending outdated provisions, increasing legal certainty and clarifying trade mark rights in terms of their scope and limitations: \u00b7  the proposed new definition does not restrict the permissible means of representation to graphic or visual representation but leaves the door open to register matter that can be represented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees; \u00b7  the proposal makes it clear that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier rights; \u00b7  it is clarified that in cases of both double identity and similarity, it is only the origin function which matters; \u00b7  in accordance with the rulings of the Court of Justice, it is appropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met; \u00b7  the trade mark owner may prevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC; \u00b7  it is made clear that the importing of goods into the Union is also prohibited where it is only the consignor who acts for commercial purposes; \u00b7  bearing in mind the outcome of the Philips/Nokia judgment, the proposal entitles right holders to stop third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing an unauthorised trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the Union, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation; \u00b7  there are provisions allowing proceedings against the distribution and sale of labels and packaging and similar items which may subsequently be combined with illicit products. 2) Achieve greater approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures with the aim of making them more consistent with the Community trade mark system, by (a) adding further substantive rules and (b) introducing principal procedural rules into the Directive in accordance with provisions contained in the Regulation. In this regard, it is proposed, inter alia: \u00b7  to insert provisions relating to geographical indications, traditional terms for wine and traditional specialities guaranteed in the Directive; \u00b7  to ensure that, in all Member States, national trade marks with reputation enjoy the same level of protection as that afforded to Community trade marks; \u00b7  to complement the Directive with a corresponding body of rules addressing trade marks as objects of property as contained in the Regulation; \u00b7  to provide for a set of specific provisions for the registration and protection of collective marks. 3) Facilitate cooperation between the offices of the Member States and OHIM for the purpose of promoting convergence of practices and the development of common tools, by putting in place a legal basis for this cooperation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the common fisheries policy (CFP) seeks to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term, to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and to implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. Scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and from the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean\u2019s Scientific Advisory Committee (GFCM \u2014 SAC) has indicated that the exploitation of anchovy and sardine stocks in the Adriatic Sea exceeds the levels required to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The vast majority are being caught by Italy and Croatia, in the northern part of the Adriatic. Currently, small pelagic fisheries in the Adriatic Sea are governed by several legal frameworks, at national, EU and international level. This proposal addresses the problem of overexploitation of small pelagic stocks due to an unsustainable fishery and ineffective governance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option was the one which called for an EU Regulation to manage small pelagic fisheries. This option should lead to an improved conservation status of anchovy and sardine, which would ultimately result in a healthier and more sustainable fishing sector dependent on this resource, with better salaries for individual fishers and greater profitability overall compared to the status quo. CONTENT: the proposed plan seeks to replenish stocks such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel and horse mackerel and contribute to their sustainable use, as well as to establish a simpler and more comprehensive management framework. The plan should: facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation by providing a basis for derogations in certain circumscribed situations; enable regionalisation to be used, whereby Member States around sea basins are involved in the conception and design of management rules for the interested parties. The multiannual-plan will apply to all EU fishing vessels irrespective of their overall participation in fishing in the Adriatic Sea (in EU and international waters). It shall include: target fishing mortalities expressed in ranges for each of the stocks, where available, which would be the basis for setting annual catch limits for those stocks; safeguard measures to give a framework to restore stocks when they fall below safe biological limits; control provisions are provided on the vessel monitoring system, prior notification, electronic logbooks and designated ports. Regarding electronic logbooks and the vessel monitoring system, the provisions included in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 are extended to cover all vessels over eight metres in length, to improve control of the fisheries covered by the multiannual plan. The plan should be evaluated every five years on the basis of scientific advice."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the dissemination of content which is protected by copyright and related rights and the linked services, including books, audiovisual productions and recorded music require the licensing of rights by different holders of copyright and related rights, such as authors, performers, producers and publishers. Such services may be provided offline, such as showing a film in a cinema or playing music in a concert hall, but also increasingly online. In some sectors, licences are most often granted directly by individual rightholders (e.g. film producers). In other sectors, the collective management of rights plays a very important role, in particular of authors' rights in musical works. Collecting societies enable rightholders to be remunerated for uses which they would not be in a position to control or enforce themselves, including in non-domestic markets. Moreover, they have an important social and cultural role as promoters of the diversity of cultural expressions by enabling the smallest and less popular repertoires to access the market. The Commission recommends action in two areas. \u00b7 Firstly, there are significant differences in the national rules governing the functioning of collecting societies, in particular as regards their transparency and accountability towards their members and rightholders. Collective rights' management in all sectors needs to adapt in terms of the service provided to members and users as regards efficiency, accuracy, transparency and accountability. \u00b7 Secondly, in the licensing of the rights of authors in musical works, online music service providers face difficulties in acquiring licences with an aggregated repertoire for the territory of more than one Member State. This situation leads to fragmentation of the EU market for these services, thereby limiting the provision of online music services by online service providers. This proposal is presented in the context of the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Europe 2020 Strategy. In its \"Single Market Act\" the Commission underlined that, in the internet age, collective management must be able to evolve towards more transnational, possibly EU-wide models of licensing. In its Communication \"A Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights\" the Commission announced that it would be proposing a legal framework for the collective management of copyright and related rights. The importance of this legislative proposal was also highlighted in the Commission's \"European Consumer Agenda\". IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment examines two groups of options to deal with: (1) options pertaining to governance and transparency standards in collecting societies are as follows: \u00b7 retaining the status quo (A1); \u00b7 better enforcement (A2) of existing EU law; \u00b7 the codification of existing principles (A3) reflecting in legislation the principles that have emerged from the case-law of the Court of Justice, the Commission's antitrust decisions and Recommendation 2005/737/EC; \u00b7 a governance and transparency framework (A4) which would codify the existing principles and provide a more elaborate framework of rules on governance and transparency, increasing the possibilities of control over collecting societies. (2) The following policy options were examined to address the complexities of the collective licensing of authors' rights in musical works for online uses: \u00b7 retaining the status quo (B1); \u00b7 the European Licensing Passport (B2): this would foster the voluntary repertoire aggregation for online uses of musical works at EU level and the licensing of rights through multi-territorial licensing infrastructures. It would lay down common rules for all collective licensors throughout the EU and would create competitive pressure on societies to develop more efficient licensing practices; \u00b7 parallel direct licensing (B3); \u00b7 extended collective licensing and country of origin principle (B4); \u00b7 a centralised portal (B5). After carefully weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches, options A4 (governance and transparency framework) and B2 (European Licensing Passport) were retained. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 50(2)(g), 53 and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal for a directive aims to put in place an appropriate legal framework for the collective management of rights that are administered by collecting societies on behalf of rightholders. It aims to: \u00b7 improve the standards of governance and transparency of collecting societies so that rightholders can exercise more effective control over them and help improve their management efficiency; \u00b7 facilitate the multi-territorial licensing by collecting societies of authors' rights in musical works for the provision of online services. (1) Collecting societies : the proposal establishes organisational and transparency rules which apply to all types of collecting societies. It provides, inter alia: \u00b7 rules governing the membership organisation of collecting societies; \u00b7 rules on collecting societies\u2019 financial management: a collecting society must: (i) specify the applicable deductions in its agreements with rightholders; (ii) assure members and rightholders fair access to any social, cultural or educational services, if funded by deductions; (iii) pay the amounts due to rightholders accurately and without undue delay and make efforts to identify rightholders. \u00b7 rules on levels of disclosure: (i) information to rightholders on amounts collected and paid, management fees charged and other deductions made; (ii) information to other collecting societies on the management of rights under representation agreements; (iii) information to rightholders, other societies and users on request; (iv) annual publication of a transparency report. (2) Multi-territorial licensing by authors' collecting societies of online rights in musical works: the proposal establishes the conditions that an authors' collecting society must respect when providing multi-territorial licensing services for online rights in musical works, namely: \u00b7 being able to process efficiently and transparently the data needed for the exploitation of such licences by using a time-sensitive, authoritative database containing the necessary data; \u00b7 being transparent as regards the online music repertoire it represents; \u00b7 offering rightholders and other societies the possibility to correct the relevant data and to ensure their accuracy; \u00b7 monitoring the actual usage of the works covered by the licences, being capable of processing usage reports and invoicing; \u00b7 paying rightholders and other collecting societies without delay and provide them with information on works used and financial data related to their rights (e.g. amounts collected, deductions made). In order to ensure that repertoires can be easily aggregated for the benefit of music service providers who want to offer a service as complete as possible across Europe and for the benefit of cultural diversity and consumers at large, specific safeguards will apply to ensure that the repertoire of all societies have access to multi-territorial licensing. The proposal also ensures that collecting societies put in place complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures so that these are available for members and rightholders. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union\u2019s economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aiming to amend Directive 1993/31/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste; Directive 1994/62/EC on package and packaging waste; Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles; Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators; Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets \u2018fit for purpose\u2019; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction \u2013 more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the targets laid down in Council Directive 1999/31/EC14 setting landfill restrictions to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy and make progress in the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative by reducing landfilling of waste destined for landfills for non-hazardous waste. The main points are as follows: Alignment of definitions : it is proposed that municipal waste should be clearly defined in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The definitions in Directives 1999/31/EC should be aligned to those of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Reduction in landfill waste: Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of the target. In the event of an extension, the Member State should take the necessary measures to reduce by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 20% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. By 31 December 2024 at the latest , the Commission should examine the target with a view to reducing it and introducing restrictions to the landfilling of non-hazardous waste other than municipal waste. To this end, the Commission should send a report accompanied by a proposal, if appropriate, shall be sent to the European Parliament and the Council. The proposal prohibits the landfilling of biodegradable waste that has been separately collected."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union. The development in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation which occurred in the meantime require the amendment of some of its provisions. The main amendments proposed are as follows : Sugar: following the reform of the common organisation of the market of sugar, incorporated in the single CMO by Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, it is proposed that Article 5 be updated so that it reflects these new provisions and allows the Azores to integrate raw cane sugar in its forecast supply balance. In previous marketing years, the sugar beet production in the Azores was not sufficient to allow its sugar industry to fulfil their allocated quota and no significant quantities of raw beet sugar were available on the market. This amendment will improve their situation by allowing them to import raw cane sugar (within the limit of the forecast supply balance). Milk-based preparations : Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 provides for a transitional period during which the Canary Islands may continue to receive supplies of determined quantities of milk-based preparations falling within CN codes 1901 90 99 and 2106 90 92 intended for industrial processing. This transitional period expires on 31 December 2009. The product falling within CN code 1901 90 99 \u2013 skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat \u2013 is a traditional product for the local consumers, including the most deprived, and has been sold in the Canary Islands during the last 40 years. The supply of this product has generated a specific local industry ensuring employment and added value. In the current situation of economic crisis it is proposed to maintain the supply of this specific product and to extend the transitional period set by the Regulation to 31 December 2013. In the light of the experience gained by the Commission, and to ensure that the Community support programmes are implemented effectively and appropriately, it is necessary to remove references in that Regulation to checks and administrative penalties. However, such national measures will continue to be communicated to the Commission in accordance with the Regulation. Wine: following the wine reform of 2008 and the recent integration of the wine CMO into the single CMO, Article 18 needs to be updated to reflect the new provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 491/2009. French overseas department of Reunion : despite the recent development of the local milk production in Reunion, the current need for drinking milk consumption on the island is not sufficiently covered. Moreover, the remoteness and insularity of this region do not allow other sources of raw milk. Consequently, it is proposed that the authorisation to produce reconstituted UHT milk from milk powder of Community origin, granted to Madeira by the first subparagraph of Article 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006, should be extended to the French overseas department of Reunion. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : these programs have a high level of execution. As the proposed modifications to Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 do not change the annual ceiling amounts for the financing of the specific supply arrangements and of the measures in favour of local production, there is no budgetary impact.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as set out in its 6 April Communication \"Towards a reform of the Common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe\", the migratory and refugee crisis exposed significant structural weaknesses and shortcomings in the design and implementation of the European asylum system, and of the Dublin rules in particular. The current Dublin system was not designed to ensure a sustainable sharing of responsibility for applicants across the Union. This has led to situations where a limited number of individual Member States had to deal with the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving in the Union, putting the capacities of their asylum systems under strain and leading to some disregard of EU rules. In addition, the effectiveness of the Dublin system is undermined by a set of complex and disputable rules on the determination of responsibility as well as lengthy procedures. In particular, this is the case for the current rules which provide for a shift of responsibility between Member States after a given time. It is clear that the Dublin system must be reformed, both to simplify it and enhance its effectiveness in practice, and to be equal to the task of dealing with situations when Member States' asylum systems are faced with disproportionate pressure. This proposal on the reform of the Dublin III Regulation is part of a first set of legislative proposals the Commission is presenting in the context of a major reform of the Common European Asylum System. These proposals include: this draft Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person; a draft Regulation which aims to extend the scope of the Eurodac Regulation to include the possibility for Member States to store and search data belonging to third-country nationals or stateless persons who are not applicants for international protection and found irregularly staying in the EU; a draft Regulation on the European Union Agency for Asylum which aims to strengthen the mandate of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). A second stage of legislative proposals reforming the Asylum Procedures and Qualification Directives, as well as the Reception Conditions Directive is due to follow to ensure the full reform of all parts of the EU asylum system. CONTENT: this proposal is a recast of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third country national or a stateless person (\"the Dublin III Regulation\"). A summary of the main provisions is as follows: New fairness mechanism : a new automated system will allow for the registration of all asylum applications made in the EU and the monitoring on a daily basis of the number of applications made in each Member State. The new system will automatically establish when a country is handling a disproportionate number of asylum applications. This reference number is identified on the basis of a key, taking account of the country's population size, and the size of its economy. Once the fairness mechanism is triggered, all new applications in the Member State concerned are allocated to other Member States, after an admissibility check has been carried out, until the number of applications is back below the 150% level. The fairness mechanism will also factor in the effort being made by a Member State to resettle those in need of international protection direct from a third country. Criteria for the reference key : the reference key is based on two criteria with equal 50% weighting: the size of the population, and the total GDP of a Member State. The number of applications for which a given Member State is responsible and the numbers of persons effectively resettled by a Member State form the basis for the calculation using the reference key and threshold. NB: a Member State will also have the option to temporarily not take part in the allocation. In that case, it would have to make a financial solidarity contribution of EUR 250 000 to the Member State receiving an applicant for whom it would otherwise have been responsible under the fairness mechanism. Streamlined procedures : procedures will be streamlined, in particular through shorter time limits for the different steps of the determination procedure, transfers and access to the asylum procedure: take charge requests, asking another Member State to take over responsibility for an application, have to be sent within one month and a decision taken by the receiving country within one month of receipt of the request. No reply will be tantamount to accepting the request; requests from one Member State to another to take back an applicant for whom the latter is responsible and who has absconded ('take back requests') will be transformed into simple take back notifications. Such notifications have to be submitted within two weeks of registration and do not require a reply, only a confirmation of receipt. All Member States will be under a clear obligation to take back applicants they are responsible for; appeals against transfer decisions will be dealt with within 15 days; proper registration of all asylum applications in the EU should help detect multiple applications and prevent irregular secondary movements. Obligations for applicants : the new system introduces clear legal obligations for applicants: explicit obligation for applicants to apply for asylum in the Member State of first irregular entry or in the Member State where a person has stayed legally prior to the application for asylum. This will make clear that applicants do not have the right to choose in which Member State they submit their application. In case an asylum applicant does not comply with this new obligation, Member States must examine the application in an accelerated procedure; applicants will also be obliged to provide all relevant information for determining the Member State responsible for their claim in a timely manner and failure to comply will have proportionate procedural consequences, such as the preclusion of information submitted unjustifiably late; to discourage secondary movements, applicants will only be entitled to material reception rights in the country where he or she is required to be present, with the exception of emergency healthcare; an obligation for the Member State of application to check whether the applicant comes from a first country of asylum or a safe third country. The Member State making this admissibility check will be considered responsible for these applications. The Member State of application must also check whether the applicant comes from a safe country of origin or presents a security risk, in which case they have to examine the application through an accelerated procedure. Best interests of children and unaccompanied minors : under the new system, the rights of unaccompanied minors will be enhanced and the assessment of the best interests of the child reinforced. The proposal clarifies that the Member State where the minor first lodged his or her application for international protection will be responsible, unless it is demonstrated that this is not in the best interests of the minor. Appeals will be accelerated but will have automatic suspensive effects, meaning no transfers will be carried out while the appeal is ongoing. The rights of unaccompanied minors have been strengthened through better defining the principle of the best interests of the child and by setting out a mechanism for making a best interests of the child-determination in all circumstances implying the transfer of a minor. New safeguards for asylum seekers : reinforced family reunification : the right to family reunification of asylum seekers present on the EU territory will be reinforced and the scope will be extended to also include siblings of an applicant as well as families formed in transit, after leaving the country of origin but before arrival on the territory of the Member State; detention : under the new system, the detention period for the purpose of transfers has been significantly reduced, from six to four weeks. Review clause : the Commission will review the functioning of the fairness mechanism 18 months after entry into force of the Regulation and annually from then on in order to assess whether the objective of ensuring a proportionate sharing of responsibility between Member States and of relieving disproportionate pressure on certain Member States is met. This review will in particular verify that the threshold for triggering the mechanism is effective. Territorial provisions : the United Kingdom and Ireland may participate in this proposal, but are not required to do so, in accordance with the relevant Protocols attached to the Treaties. As regards Denmark, it has an opt out and does not participate in justice and home affairs measures. However, Denmark applies the current Regulation on the basis of an international agreement concluded in 2006. Under that agreement, Denmark may opt in to the recast Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial resources necessary to support the implementation of this proposal amount to EUR 1828.6 million foreseen for the period 2017-2020. This would cover the transfer costs once the corrective allocation mechanism has been triggered for the benefit of a Member State, the establishment and operation of the IT system for the registration and automatic allocation of asylum applicants."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and the European Community entered into force on 29 August 20112 and has since been renewed automatically. The previous Protocol to the Agreement, which entered into force on 23 May 2014, expired on 22 May 2018. The evaluation report concluded that the Union\u2019s tuna fishing sector has a strong interest in fishing in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and that a renewal of the Protocol would help strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance and contribute to improved governance of the fisheries in the region. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe with a view to concluding a new Protocol to the Agreement. Following these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 17 April 2019. The Protocol covers a period of five years from the date of its provisional application, i.e. from the date on which it is signed. The negotiation of a new protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe forms part of the Union\u2019s external action in relation to countries in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and takes into account, in particular, Union objectives on respecting democratic principles and human rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol on the implementation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the European Community. Objectives of the proposal The objective of the Protocol is to enable the Union and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe to work more closely on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe waters and to support efforts by S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe to develop its fisheries sector. Fishing opportunities In accordance with the priorities of the Fisheries Policy reform, the new Protocol provides fishing opportunities for Union vessels in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe waters, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and following the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: (a) 28 freezer tuna seiners; (b) 6 surface longliners. The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 840 000, based on: - a reference tonnage of 8 000 tonnes per year, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR 400 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol; - support for the development of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\u2019s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 440 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\u2019s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure. The Commission is authorised to approve, on behalf of the Union, amendments to the Protocol to be adopted by the Joint Committee established under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2010, nearly one quarter of Europeans (116 million) were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This is about 2 million more than in the previous year and the first figures available for 2011 confirm this trend. About 40 million of European citizens suffer from severe material deprivation. The main features of material deprivation are the inability to access appropriate quantities and quality of food and homelessness (4.1 million were homeless in Europe in 2009/2010, according to estimates). There are 25.4 million children at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the Union. Children suffering from these forms of material deprivation are less likely than their better-off peers to do well at school, enjoy good health and realise their full potential as adults. While the needs of those who are at the margins of the society keep growing, the ability of Member States to support them has in many cases diminished. In many Member States it is felt that policies decided at European level are in some ways responsible for these developments. The Union's response to poverty and material deprivation: the main Union's instrument for supporting employability, fighting poverty and promoting social inclusion is and will remain the European Social Fund (ESF). Next to that, the EU's Food Distribution programme for the Most Deprived People (MDP) has for more than two decades provided food aid for those persons. It was created in 1987 to make meaningful use of agricultural surpluses, which might otherwise have been destroyed, by making them available to Member States wishing to use them. Over the years, the scheme became an important source of provisions for organisations working in direct contact with the least fortunate members of society, providing them with food. The expected depletion and high unpredictability of intervention stocks over the period 2011-2020, as a consequence of successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, has deprived the MDP of the original rationale underpinning it and it will be discontinued at the end of 2013. The potential significant cut in the support provided under the MDP scheme in 2012 was heavily criticized by civil society organisations, with regional and local authorities' representatives stressing the importance of this support and pleading for its continuation at a time when needs are increasing. Discussions in the Council and the European Parliament and with civil society and local authorities on the current forms of aid for the most deprived under the MDP programme have provided meaningful insights and ideas for the future. On the other hand, Member States\u2019 views about such an instrument are divided: seven Member States have expressed their opposition to continuation of the MDP beyond 2013. Other Member States have argued strongly in support of the scheme. The European Parliament has repeatedly expressed strong support for the continuation of the food aid programme in the interest of better social cohesion in Europe. It called for a strategy to be drawn up on the subject \u2013 firstly, in a written declaration (2010) and then in a resolution (2011). Given persistent material deprivation, EU assistance to the most deprived in society remains necessary. In its proposal for the next multiannual financial framework the Commission has reflected this and reserved a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a new instrument designed to fight extreme forms of poverty and exclusion. Against this background, the proposed Regulation establishes for the period 2014-2020 a new instrument that will complement the existing cohesion instruments and notably the European Social Fund, by addressing the worst and most socially corrosive forms of poverty, food deprivation as well as homelessness and material deprivation of children while supporting accompanying measures aiming at the social reintegration of the most deprived persons of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the core issue examined by the impact assessment concerned the scope of the new instrument. The options considered were: Option 0 : no funding; Option 1 : a successor instrument to the current MDP limited to dispensing food aid; Option 2 : an instrument which would complement the distribution of food aid with support for accompanying measures aiming at the social inclusion of the food aid recipients, and Option 3 : a comprehensive instrument supporting material relief in terms of food, goods for homeless people and goods for materially deprived children, combined with accompanying measures aiming at the social reintegration of the most deprived persons. The net impact of Option 0 depends on how the funds made available are reallocated. But it would certainly be seen as attesting to an erosion of solidarity in Europe at a time when poverty is increasing. Compared to Option 1, Option 2 and even more so Option 3 entail a reduction of the food aid distributed as some resources are allocated to other types of actions. However, the accompanying measures should also ensure greater sustainability of the results achieved. Option 3 is preferred because it best allows tailoring the supported interventions to local needs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 175(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this Commission proposal related to the creation of a European Fund for the most deprived for the period 2014-2020. The proposed Regulation defines the objectives and scope, sets down the available financial resources and the various eligibility criteria, and lays down the rules to ensure the Fund\u2019s effectiveness. General and specific objectives: the general objective of the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (the Fund) is to promote social cohesion in the Union by contributing to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy's objective of reducing by at least 20 million of the number of people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion. This translates into the specific objective of supporting national schemes which provide non-financial assistance to the most deprived persons through partner organisations. Scope: the Fund addresses food deprivation, homelessness and material deprivation of children. Each Member State may choose to address one or more of these forms of deprivation. It may also support accompanying measures, complementing material support, to contribute to the social reintegration of the most deprived persons. Eligible population and targeting: the population eligible to receive material assistance comprises the most deprived persons of the Union. Definition of the criteria for identifying the most deprived persons to be assisted will be the responsibility of the Member States or the partner organisations since they are best placed to target the assistance taking local needs into account. By defining the type of goods that will be distributed, namely food or basic consumer goods for personal use of homeless persons or of children, the Regulation also contains an indirect targeting mechanism. N.B. the Fund may only be used to support distribution of food or goods that are in conformity with the Union legislation on consumer product safety. Partner organisations: the partner organisations are the ones that deliver directly or indirectly the food or goods to the most deprived persons. In order to ensure that the Fund will contribute to sustainable reduction of poverty and to improvement of social cohesion, the partner organisations that deliver directly the food or goods will themselves have to undertake activities complementing the provision of material assistance, aiming at the social integration of the most deprived persons. The Fund itself may support such accompanying measures. The national authorities may either purchase the food or goods or make them available to partner organisations or provide the partner organisation with funding for the purchase of the food or goods. If the purchase of food or goods is undertaken by a partner organisation, it can either distribute the items itself or entrust the distribution to other partner organisations. Implementing provisions: the Fund will be implemented following the model of cohesion policy, i.e. through shared management on the basis of one 7-year operational programme per Member State covering the period 2014 to 2020. Implementation arrangements: the proposal follows the approach of the structural funds in terms of implementation arrangements, allowing notably the Member States to use, if they so wish, the structures, designated authorities and procedures set up for the European Social Fund, in order to minimize the administrative burden related to the transition from the current scheme for distribution of food to the most deprived persons to the new Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived. The provisions relating to programming, monitoring, evaluation and information and communication are, however, streamlined and simplified in order to be commensurate to the specificity of the objectives and target populations of the Fund. Eligibility rules: the eligibility rules are also designed to take into account the nature of the Fund and of the various actors that will be involved in its implementation. In particular, the Regulation provides for simplified cost methods for the majority of categories of expenditure and opens options for the others categories. Financial management of the Fund: the financial management and control system also derives from the structural funds logic. Also, some provisions have been adapted and simplified to be fully adequate to the types of operations that will be supported by the Fund, notably in terms of pre-financing, content of the payments applications to the Commission as well as proportional control. The partner organisations have a limited capacity to advance the funds necessary. Likewise, the Member States may have difficulties to mobilise the resources necessary to pre-finance the operations. In addition, the Member States facing the greatest fiscal constraints are likely to be those with the highest number of most deprived people. In order to address this situation, that could put at risk the achievement of the Fund's objective, the level of pre-financing is set at 11% of the total allocation to a Member State. This will allow covering up to 90% of the costs of the first year's aid campaign not counting technical assistance, transport, administrative costs and the accompanying measures. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the Fund for the period 2014-2020 shall be EUR 2.5 billion at 2011 prices, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in an annex to the proposal. For the purpose of programming and subsequent inclusion in the general budget of the Union, the amount of resources shall be indexed at 2% per year. Criteria will be laid down by the Commission, by means of implementing acts, setting out the annual breakdown of the global resources by Member State, taking into account the following indicators established by Eurostat: the population suffering from severe material deprivation; the population living in households with very low work intensity. 0.35% of the global resources shall be allocated to technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. Appropriations of around EUR 7.112 million between 2012 and 2020 are also provide for the management of the Fund (Heading 5 of the multiannual framework \u2013 human and administrative resources). DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty shall be devolved to the Commission in respect of the responsibilities of Member States concerning: the procedure for reporting irregularities and recovery of sums unduly paid, the modalities of exchange of information of operations, the arrangements for the adequate audit trail, the conditions of national audits, the designation criteria for managing authorities and certifying authorities, the identification of commonly accepted data carriers, and the criteria for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied."}]}

BACKGROUND: Decision (EU) 2017/1324 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for the participation of the Union in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The strategic objective of PRIMA is to build research and innovation capacities and to develop knowledge and common innovative solutions for agro-food systems in order to make them sustainable, as well as for an integrated water supply and management in the Mediterranean area. PRIMA will be jointly undertaken by a number of Member States and third countries with a high level of commitment to scientific, management and financial integration and under the same terms and conditions. Jordan expressed its wish to join PRIMA as a Participating State and pledged to commit a financial contribution of EUR 30 million to the initiative. The negotiations started on 26 June 2017 and were successfully completed on 10 July 2017, when the text of the draft Agreement was initialled by representatives from each of the future Parties.

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty of Lisbon introduced a distinction between the following: powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), as referred to in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning pf the EU; and powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts) as referred to in Article 291 of the Treaty. The measures which may be covered by delegations of powers correspond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC. This procedure still appears in the basic acts covered by this proposal and continues to apply in those acts until they are formally amended and adapted to the Lisbon Treaty. The Commission made three horizontal alignment legislative proposals in 2013 (Omnibus I, Omnibus II and Omnibus III). The European Parliament adopted its legislative resolutions on 25 February 2014, broadly agreeing with the proposals by the Commission. The Council, however, did not support the Commission proposals, due to the absence of stronger guarantees that Member State experts would be systematically consulted in the preparation of delegated acts. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission subsequently agreed on a new framework for delegated acts in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016 (IAA) and acknowledged the need to align all existing legislation to the legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. In particular, they agreed on the need to give high priority to the prompt alignment of all basic acts that still refer to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. CONTENT: the proposal aligns three basic acts to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, these acts being: Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters; Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims; Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation No 1348/2000. The alignment clauses reflect the following points in the IAA: they now provide for a clear commitment to a systematic consultation of experts from the Member States in the preparation of delegated acts. This fulfils a key condition for a successful second attempt to align the old regulatory procedure with scrutiny provisions to the Lisbon Treaty. This commitment is now explicitly included in the new standard clauses; they recognise the important role of early cooperation and exchange of views with the European Parliament in relation to delegated acts. The European Parliament must receive all documents at the same time as Member State experts, including the draft delegated acts, and the alignment clauses provide for systematic access of European Parliament experts to the meetings of Commission expert groups preparing delegated acts. Accordingly, to each basic act a number of amendments are made, and references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny are deleted. As regards the duration of the empowerment the Commission proposes empowerments with an indeterminate duration, since the legislator has the possibility of revoking an empowerment in all cases and at any time. Acts on which individual legislative proposals have been made in the meantime are not included in the proposal. This concerns two acts in the area of justice: Regulation (EC) No. 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation (EC) No. 861/2007 establishing a European small claims procedure. These have been aligned in the meantime been aligned by Regulation (EU) 2015/2421. This proposal is linked to the proposal on adapting a number of legal acts to Article 290 and 291 of the TFEU."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 82/891/EEC, Council Directive 89/666/EEC, Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council have been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, whilst stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, this proposal seeks to codify the following directives: Sixth Council Directive concerning the division of public limited liability companies (82/891/EEC), Eleventh Council Directive concerning disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State (89/666/EEC), Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning mergers of public limited liability companies, Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive lays down measures concerning the following: the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital; the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States concerning disclosure requirements in respect of public and private limited liability companies; the disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State; mergers of public limited liability companies; cross-border mergers of limited liability companies; the division of public limited liability companies.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: with regard to child victims, the main cause of this phenomenon is vulnerability resulting from a variety of factors. Insufficient response by law enforcement mechanisms contributes to the prevalence of these phenomena, and the difficulties are exacerbated because certain forms of offences transcend national borders. Victims are reluctant to report abuse, variations in national criminal law and procedure may give rise to differences in investigation and prosecution, and convicted offenders may continue to be dangerous after serving their sentences. Developments in information technology have made these problems more acute by making it easier to produce and distribute child sexual abuse images while offering offenders anonymity and spreading responsibility across jurisdictions. Ease of travel and income differences fuel so-called child sex tourism, resulting often in child sex offenders committing offences abroad with impunity. National legislation covers some of these problems, to varying degrees. However, it is not strong or consistent enough to provide a vigorous social response to this disturbing phenomenon. The recent Council of Europe Convention CETS No. 201 on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (\"the COE Convention\") arguably constitutes the highest international standard for protecting children against sexual abuse and exploitation to date. However, not all Member States have yet acceded to this Convention. At EU level, Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA, introduces a minimum of approximation of Member States\u2019 legislation to criminalise the most serious forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation, to extend domestic jurisdiction, and to provide for a minimum of assistance to victims. Although the requirements have generally been put into implementation, the Framework Decision has a number of shortcomings. It approximates legislation only on a limited number of offences, does not address new forms of abuse and exploitation using information technology, does not remove obstacles to prosecuting offences outside national territory, does not meet all the specific needs of child victims, and does not contain adequate measures to prevent offences. It is therefore necessary to recast this text in order to respond to the needs of these new challenges. It should be noted that this proposal would replace existing legislation in place since 2004, and builds on a proposal made on 25/03/2009. After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, this proposal has to be reshaped. This will allow the Commission to verify that EU law is correctly translated into national rules and take those countries that are not complying to Court. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered several options: option 1 : no new EU action; option 2 : complement existing legislation with non-legislative measures: Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA, would not be amended. Instead, non-legislative measures could be put in place to support coordinated implementation of national legislation. This would include exchanging information and experience in prosecution, protection or prevention, awareness raising, cooperation with private sector and encouragement of self regulation, or the setting up of mechanisms for data collection; option 3 : new legislation on prosecuting offenders, protecting victims, and preventing offences: a new legislative act would be adopted, incorporating the existing Framework Decision, certain provisions of the COE Convention, and additional elements not contained in either of these. It would cover prosecution of offenders, protection of the victims, and prevention of the phenomenon; option 4 : new comprehensive legislation: the existing provisions of Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA would be supplemented by EU action to amend substantive criminal law and procedure, protect victims, and prevent offences as under option 3, plus the non-legislative measures identified under option 2 to improve the implementation of national legislation. Following the analysis of the economic impact, social impacts, and impacts on fundamental rights, options 3 and 4 represent the best approach to the problems and achieve the objectives of the proposal. The preferred option would be option 4, followed by option 3. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82 (2) and 83 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Given the cross-border dimension, EU action is required as the objective of effectively protecting children cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States, either at central level or at regional or local level. CONTENT: the proposal will both repeal and incorporate Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA to include the following new elements: substantive criminal law : serious forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation currently not covered by EU legislation would be criminalised. This includes, for instance, the organisation of travel arrangements with the purpose of committing sexual abuse, something particularly relevant, but not exclusively, in the context of child sex tourism. The definition of child pornography is amended to approximate it to the COE Convention and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Special consideration is given to offences against children in a particularly vulnerable situation. In particular, the level of criminal penalties should be increased so that they are proportionate, effective and dissuasive. To determine the degree of seriousness and attach penalties proportionate to it, consideration is given to different factors which may intervene in very different sorts of offences, like the degree of harm to the victim, the level of culpability of the offender and the level of risk posed to society. Accordingly, a number of relations between offences can be established. In general terms, activities involving sexual contact are more serious than those which do not; the presence of exploitation makes the offence more serious than its absence; coercion, force or threats are more serious than abuse of a position of power of the offender or weakness of the victim, which in turn is more serious than free consent of the victim. Prostitution, which involves sexual activities and money, is more serious than pornographic performances, which may or may not include them; recruiting to prostitution or similar is more serious than mere causing, as it involves active seeking of children as commodities. On child pornography, production, usually involving recruiting and sexual contact with the child, is more serious than other offences like distribution or offering, which in turn are more serious than possession or access. As a result of combining these different criteria, distinction is thus made between five different groups of offences, depending on their degree of seriousness, leading to accordingly different levels of penalties for the basic crimes; new criminal offences in the IT environment : new forms of sexual abuse and exploitation facilitated by the use of IT would be criminalised. This includes on-line pornographic performances, or knowingly obtaining access to child pornography, to cover cases where viewing child pornography from websites without downloading or storing the images does not amount to \"possession of\" or \"procuring\" child pornography. Also the new offence of \"grooming\" is incorporated closely following the wording agreed in the COE Convention. criminal investigation and initiation of criminal proceedings : a number of provisions would be introduced to assist with investigating offences and bringing charges. A mechanism to coordinate prosecution in cases of multiple jurisdictions is included, but may be superseded once the proposal for a Framework Decision on conflict of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings is adopted; prosecution of offences committed abroad : rules on jurisdiction would be amended to ensure that child sexual abusers or exploiters from the EU, both nationals and habitual residents, face prosecution even if they commit their crimes outside the EU, via so-called sex tourism; protection of victims : new provisions will be included to ensure that victims have easy access to legal remedies and do not suffer from participating in criminal proceedings. They cover assistance and support to victims, and protection of victims specifically in criminal investigations and proceedings; prevention of offences : amendments would be introduced to help prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation offences, through a number of actions concentrating on previous offenders to prevent recidivism, and to restrict access to child pornography on the internet. The aim of restricting such access is to reduce the circulation of child pornography by making it more difficult to use the publicly-accessible Web. It is not a substitute for action to remove the content at the source or to prosecute offenders; other protective measures not contained in the COE Convention : the proposal includes elements not contained in the COE Convention, notably: (i) ensuring implementation across the EU of prohibitions from activities with children imposed on offenders; (ii) blocking access to child pornography on the internet; (iii) criminalising coercing a child into sexual relations with a third party and child sexual abuse online; (iv) a non-punishment clause for child victims. It also goes beyond the obligations imposed by the COE Convention regarding the level of penalties, free legal counselling for child victims and repression of activities encouraging abuse and child sex tourism. Moreover, incorporating provisions from the Convention into EU law will facilitate faster adoption of national measures compared to national procedures for ratification, and ensure better monitoring of implementation. Territorial scope : the adoption of the proposal will be addressed to the Member States. The application of the resulting Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols (No 21) and (No 22) annexed to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: International maritime shipping remains the only means of transportation not included in the Union's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, it emitted 13% of the total Union greenhouse gas emissions from transport. In its Resolution of February 2014 on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, Parliament noted that all sectors of the economy would need to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if the Union is to deliver its fair share of global efforts. In the future, seaborne trade volumes are likely to grow, which will lead to a significant increase of associated GHG emissions if mitigation measures are not put in place swiftly. According to a study from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), depending on future economic and energy developments, global shipping emissions could grow between 50% and 250% by 2050. The aim of the EU MRV Regulation is to collect data on shipping emissions for further policymaking and to incentivise emission reductions by providing information on ships' efficiency to relevant markets. It obliges companies to monitor, report and verify the fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and energy efficiency of their ships on voyages to and from European Economic Area (EEA) ports on an annual basis, starting from 2018. Following the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in October 2016 the IMO adopted the legal framework for a global data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships (\u201cglobal IMO DCS\u201d). Taking into account the coexistence of these two monitoring, reporting and verification systems, the Commission has examined how the two systems could be aligned in order to reduce the administrative burden on vessels, while preserving the objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is a partial alignment of the two monitoring, reporting and verification systems to help reduce the administrative burden on shipping companies, while preserving the key objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. However, this partial alignment should not change the EU MRV Regulation in terms of governance, the scope of the Regulation and its requirements for verification, transparency and reporting of CO2 emissions. Any amendment to the EU MRV Regulation should therefore be limited to aligning it with the IMO global data collection system for aspects relating to definitions, monitoring parameters and monitoring plans and templates. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2015/757 proposal aims at reducing the administrative burden for ships performing maritime transport activities that are covered by both the EU MRV Regulation and the global IMO DCS while preserving the specific objectives of the EU action in this area. Therefore, the proposal seeks to: \u00b7 amend the definitions of \"company\" and \"reporting period\" and also the attribution of monitoring and reporting obligations in case of \"changes of company\". This will ensure that the same legal entities monitor and report according to similarly calculated reporting periods for their ships performing EEA-related maritime transport activities under the EU MRV Regulation and under the IMO's global data collection system; \u00b7 amend the monitoring parameters: for this purpose, (i) the deadweight parameter should be provided, but the declaration of the \"cargo carried\" should remain optional; (ii) the parameter \"time at sea\" should be replaced by the parameter \"hours underway\" as defined in the IMO global data collection system; (iii) the \"distance travelled\" should be calculated according to the method provided by the IMO global data collection system in order to reduce the administrative burden; \u00b7 streamline the content of monitoring plans to take into account the IMO's global data collection system, except for those provisions which are necessary to ensure that only EU-related data are monitored and reported under the EU MRV Regulation. Therefore, all provisions for \"per voyage\" monitoring should be maintained in the monitoring plan. On the other hand, some relevant features of the EU MRV Regulation should be maintained:  scope in terms of ships and activities covered under the EU MRV Regulation will be maintained (thus covering the majority of ships above 5000 GT calling at EU ports for maritime transport purposes); ships' CO2 emissions within Union ports are also to be monitored and reported separately. Also data on voyages internal to any EU Member State is to be monitored and reported so as to enable Member States authorities to have robust and comparable data of their national shipping emissions. Current MRV provisions on verification of data by accredited third parties are to be kept ; the EU MRV Regulation provisions on publication of individual ships' data of CO2 emissions and energy efficiency is also to be kept."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002, the Union and its Member States committed themselves to act against the continued decline of many fish stocks. Cod, herring and sprat are the subject of important fisheries in the Baltic Sea. They are also important components of the Baltic ecosystem and there are also strong biological interactions between them. Scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ('ICES') has indicated that the current exploitation rates for some of these stocks are not consistent with achieving maximum sustainable yield. A management plan for the Baltic Sea cod stocks has been in place since 2007 but the stocks of herring and sprat are not yet subject to a management plan. This hinders the sustainable management of these fisheries, and does not provide stability of fishing opportunities for the fishermen operating in these fisheries. In addition, Member States and stakeholders have expressed support for the development and implementation of management plans for the key Baltic stocks. In order to increase predictability for fishermen and to ensure high, stable and sustainable catches , the proposal is the first multiannual plan adopted in accordance with the new Common Fisheries Policy which entered into force in January 2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three options were analysed from biological, environmental and economic-social aspects. The option with most beneficial impact has been then developed into the present multiannual plan: to ensure sustainable fisheries at MSY level by 2015 for the stocks concerned is to achieve biological and environmental benefits. The probable reduction in the overall amount of fishing would also imply a reduction in emissions from vessel engines; as for the economic-social impact , bringing the herring and sprat stocks under a management plan would provide a systematic basis for setting annual TACs in a way which would provide the pelagic sector with predictability of catches which would help support business planning and stability of supply; the abolishment of fishing effort system and of requirement of single area fishing will simplify the legal framework and reduce administrative burden on Member State and industry. CONTENT: the Commission proposes, in the framework of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a multiannual fisheries management plan for the Baltic Sea that applies to cod, herring and sprat stocks. This plan replaces the management plan in place for the two Baltic cod stocks. The plan will ensure the sustainable exploitation of these Baltic Sea stocks, and provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on interactions within and between the stocks and with other aspects of the ecosystem and environment. In accordance with the overall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources, the main elements of the plan are: objectives and targets (Achieve levels of fishing mortality consistent with the principle of maximum sustainable yield); conservation reference points expressed in spawning biomass levels and specific conservation measures; provisions related to the landing obligation; framework of technical measures; periodic evaluation of the plan based on scientific advice. The plan does not include annual limits on fishing effort. It establishes regional cooperation in respect of adopting technical measures, provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for the by catches in the fisheries for the stocks concerned. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the effective return of third country nationals who do not fulfil or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in the Member State of the Union is an essential part of a comprehensive approach to ensure the proper functioning of the EU migration policies and for maintaining public trust in the Union migration system. However, the EU system to return irregular migrants is not sufficiently effective. The lack of valid travel documents issued by the country of destination of the returnee is one of the main obstacles to successful return. At present, Member States may issue a substitute document for those illegally staying third-country nationals who do not possess a valid travel document. However, its recognition by third countries is low, including because of its unsatisfactory security features and standards.

It aims to: harmonise the format and technical specifications of the European travel document for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals in order to ensure higher technical and security standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification; facilitate recognition of this document by third countries for the purpose of return and readmission; increase flexibility for the authorities of third countries in terms of managing documents in order for them to accelerate the administrative procedures for return and reduce the administrative burden on competent consular authorities; set the rules relating to the fees for issuing the European travel document for return, which shall be free of charge for the third-country national given that it shall only be valid for a single journey; contribute to reducing the period during which returnees awaiting removal are kept in administrative detention."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. The Commission has consistently made clear that protecting Union citizens in the United Kingdom, as well as United Kingdom nationals in the European Union is a priority. This will require Member States to take a generous approach to the United Kingdom nationals who are already resident in their territory. The expectation is that the United Kingdom acts in the same manner. As of the withdrawal date, in the event there is no withdrawal agreement concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom, Union law on social security coordination will no longer apply in the relations between the Union and the United Kingdom. This means that social security entitlements will not be guaranteed for Union citizens who are, or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States and in situations involving the United Kingdom (e.g. they worked or resided there while the United Kingdom was a Member State of the Union) and also of the United Kingdom nationals who are or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States. This proposal is necessary to protect the social security entitlements of the persons concerned with regard to facts or events occurring and periods completed before the date of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union in order to mitigate the risks associated with the so-called 'no deal' scenario. CONTENT: the proposal aims at ensuring that persons who have exercised, as Union citizens, their right to freedom of movement before the withdrawal date maintain their social security entitlements related to facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. Other relevant persons in situations involving the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, should also maintain those entitlements: stateless persons, refugees, as well as family members and survivors of all the previous categories. Certain core principles of social security coordination as enshrined in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems (assimilation, aggregation, equality of treatment), as well as rules of this Regulation which give practical effect to the implementation of those principles (such as the pro-rata calculation of an old-age pension), should continue to apply in respect of those persons, as regards facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. The proposal does not concern rights accrued after 29 March 2019, nor the exportability of cash benefits, the continued provision of sickness benefits in kind and the rules on applicable legislation. This Regulation shall apply as from the day following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: with the accession of Croatia, the European Union enlarged its customs union.

On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights, the issue of the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of Croatia in the course of its accession to the EU. Negotiations with China resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 7 October 2015 in Brussels. It is now appropriate to conclude the Agreement.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid \"in beneficiary countries\", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the DCI and on the parallel proposal amending the EIDHR."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. To ensure a well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement, the Council adopted, on 13 October 2020, Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Member States have launched or plan to launch initiatives to issue vaccination certificates. However, for these to be used effectively in a cross-border context when citizens exercise their free movement rights, such certificates need to be fully interoperable, secure and verifiable. A commonly agreed approach is required among Member States on the content, format, principles and technical standards of such certificates. In their declaration adopted following the informal video conferences on 25-26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for further work on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission is working with Member States in the e-Health network, a voluntary network of national e-Health authorities, to prepare for the interoperability of these certificates. Work is also underway to develop a common harmonised data set for COVID-19 test result certificates. CONTENT: based on the technical work done so far, the proposed Regulation establishes the digital green certificate, which is a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital green certificate The interoperable digital green certificate should allow for the issuance, cross-border verification and acceptance of any of the following certificates: (i) vaccination certificates, (ii) certificates for screening tests (NAAT/RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) and (iii) certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. Member States should issue the certificates in a digital and/or paper-based format. Certificates issued by Member States should contain an interoperable barcode to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The certificates should be available free of charge and in the official language(s) of the issuing Member State as well as in English. Trust framework The Commission and the Member States should establish a digital trust framework infrastructure allowing for the secure issuance and verification of certificates and ensuring, as far as possible, interoperability with internationally established technology systems. The proposal also provides for the acceptance of secure and verifiable certificates issued by third countries to EU citizens and their family members according to an international standard that is interoperable with the trust framework established by the Regulation and that will contain the necessary personal data, following an implementing decision by the Commission. Issuance, content and acceptance of certificates The proposal provides details on the issuance, content and acceptance of the vaccination certificate, the test certificate and the certificate of recovery. The certificates would include a limited set of essential information such as name, date of birth, date of issue, relevant information on the vaccine administered/tested/recovery and a unique certificate identifier. The digital green certificate would be valid in all EU Member States and open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The possession of a \u2018digital green certificate\u2019, in particular a vaccination certificate, should not be a precondition for the exercise of free movement. In particular, the proposed Regulation cannot be interpreted as establishing an obligation or right to be vaccinated. Notification The proposal establishes a notification procedure to ensure that the other Member States and the Commission are informed of the restrictions on the right to free movement made necessary by the pandemic. Data protection The certificates should contain only such personal data as is necessary. Given that the personal data includes sensitive medical data, a very high level of data protection should be ensured and data minimisation principles should be preserved. In particular, the \u2018Digital Green Certificate\u2019 framework should not require the setting up and maintenance of a database at EU level but should allow for the decentralised verification of digitally signed interoperable certificates. Temporary measure The proposal foresees that the measures should be suspended once the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 97/9/EC on Investor-Compensation Schemes (ICSD) provides for clients receiving investment services from investment firms to be compensated in specific circumstances where the firm is unable to return money or financial instruments that it holds on the client's behalf. In recent years, the Commission has received numerous investor complaints about the application of the ICSD in a number of important cases involving large investor losses. The complaints relate to the coverage and funding of schemes and delays in obtaining compensation. The main problem with the application of the Directive is the large margin for discretion it grants to Member States. Moreover, there are issues such as the current non-compensation of investors who, due to the default of a depositary or third party, cannot recover their assets or suffer a loss in the value of their units or shares in a UCITS. These need to be addressed at EU level, since other solutions could fragment the protection of investors in the EU markets. An additional element relates to the fact that through the amendment of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (Directive 94/19/EC), the level of protection for bank depositors was increased. Moreover, the functioning of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DSG) is being modified (see COD/2010/0207). Investment firms should not be undermined due to the increase of protection in the bank deposits sector. Therefore it is necessary to assess the level of protection of investors at EU level, to take into account any regulatory change that might have consequences in the field of investments. This initiative is part of a broader package on compensation and guarantee schemes that will comprise two proposals for amendment of the Directives on Investor Compensation Schemes and on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and a White Paper on the insurance schemes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options were mainly related to the funding of the schemes, the payout delays, the coverage of the compensation and the level of compensation. Each policy option was assessed against the following criteria: investor protection and confidence, level playing field in the protection provided for different types of investments or services in the EU and cost-effectiveness that is the extent to which the option achieves the sought objectives and facilitates the operation of securities markets in a cost effective and efficient way. LEGAL BASE: Article 53(1) of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal aims at improving the practical functioning of the ICSD, at clarifying the scope of the ICSD taking into account the financial crisis and recent changes in the EU regulatory landscape, at reducing gaps in the regulatory system and disparities between the protection of clients of investment firms and of banking depositors. In the light of the existing differences in the functioning of the schemes at national level, the proposal introduces common rules to ensure a degree of harmonisation in the funding of the schemes and in the day-to-day practice. It also introduces a provision of a borrowing mechanism among national schemes as a last resort tool to compensate any temporary needs from schemes, subject to a rigorous assessment carried out by the European Securities and Markets Authority and to the obligation to repay any loan within the maximum period of five years. The main points are as follows: Alignment with MiFID - services covered and classification of clients : the scope of the ICSD is currently cross-referenced to investment services as defined under the Investment Services Directive (Council Directive 93/22/EEC). The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC on MiFID) has repealed the ISD and broadened the scope of services covered under the sectoral legislation (e.g the operation of Multilateral Trading Facilities is included in the scope of MiFID). A number of technical issues have also arisen, such as the coverage of firms depending on the scope of their authorisation (i.e. whether the firm is authorised to hold client assets or not). The proposed amendment clarifies that all investment services and activities covered under MiFID should be subject to the ICSD and that if firms hold client assets (irrespective of restrictions on their authorisation or the nature of their investment service) then clients should be entitled to compensation under the ICSD. Another amendment deriving from MiFID provisions concerns the classification of clients. National legislation in Member States may provide that professional and institutional investors can be excluded from coverage under the ICSD. However, since the ICSD pre-dates the MiFID, the list of professional and institutional investors under the ICSD does not coincide with the corresponding list under MiFID. The proposal aligns the classification of clients in the ICSD with the MiFID definition of clients considered as professional. This will ensure consistency between the two Directives, and result in better protection for medium-sized enterprises which may currently be excluded from the protection granted by the ICSD and are instead normally classified as retail clients under the MiFID. Failure of a third party custodian: the ICSD protects investors when a firm is unable to return financial instruments or money held on a client's behalf in connection with investment services. Under MiFID, financial instruments can be held in two different ways: (i) by the investment firm itself holding financial instruments for a client, or (ii) by a custodian usually selected by the firm. Investors may not only be exposed to the failure of the firm, but also to the potential failure of a custodian. In a case where a third party custodian is not able to return the financial instruments to its client, the client will not be able to benefit from any payment by the compensation scheme established under the ICSD. As a result, there is a difference in the level of protection provided for investors who have purchased a financial instrument, depending on whether the firm itself or a third party custodian holds their assets. The proposal extends compensation to investors for claims relating to the failure of a firm to return financial instruments due to the failure of a third party custodian. Failure of a UCITS depositary : the management of Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is not a MiFID investment service. As a result the ICSD does not cover UCITS and their units' holders in cases where losses are suffered due to the failure of a UCITS depositary or sub-custodian. This situation however is comparable, in substance, to the one described above where losses are suffered due to the failure of an investment firm custodian or sub-custodian. As a consequence, the proposed measure will give UCITS holders the right to be compensated by the investor-compensation scheme if the assets cannot be returned to the UCITS, because of the failure of a UCITS depositary or sub-custodian. The cost of this extension in coverage should be borne by these entities rather than investment firms. Exclusion of claims involving market abuse: the ICSD excludes claims where a criminal conviction has been obtained for money laundering but not claims by investors who have engaged in market abuse. The proposal modifies the relevant provisions so that the ICSD will explicitly exclude any claim for compensation where the investor has engaged in actions that are prohibited under Directive 2003/6/EC on insider dealing and market manipulation. The investors who have committed these acts should be excluded from compensation. Level of compensation : the ICSD harmonises the minimum level of compensation (EUR 20 000) for each investor, and this was aligned with the one set under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (EUR 20 000 at the time). But the compensation limit of EUR 20 000 was never adjusted to reflect inflation or the increased exposure of European investors to financial instruments since the ICSD entered into force. Furthermore, the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) was recently amended to provide for at least EUR 50 000 per depositor per credit institution, to be increased to a fixed level of EUR 100 000. The Commission proposes to increase the level of compensation to a fixed amount of EUR 50 000. As some Member States have currently a higher level of compensation, a grandfathering clause of three years will allow them to adapt to the EUR 50 000 coverage level. In the case of credit institutions doubts may arise as to the coverage under the ICSD rather than the DGSD of monies deposited in a bank in the context of the provision of investment services. To deal with situations of possible uncertainty due to the specific nature of banks which may provide both banking activity and investment services, the ICSD is being amended to specify that in cases of doubt the investor is to be compensated under the DGSD (which provided a higher level of coverage). Funding principles : the broad discretion under the ICSD about how to fund schemes (e.g. ex ante or ex post, in respect of the occurrence of any loss events) and huge differences in the way funding is organised by individual Member States create a number of problems. A new article is introduced specifying the basic principles about the funding of the investor-compensation schemes. In particular: in principle, the cost of financing schemes should continue to be borne by market participants; the schemes should be adequately financed in proportion to their potential liabilities; in order to provide a sufficient level of funding, a minimum target fund level will be established for all the schemes. This target fund level will be fully ex ante funded. Taking into account the current differences at national level, the target fund level should initially be reached within a 10-year period; when, in concrete cases, the ex ante funds are not sufficient to cover the liabilities of a scheme, additional calls for contributions from entities covered under the scheme should be ensured. However, they should not jeopardise the stability of the financial system of the Member State ; once these funding sources have been exhausted, the scheme may have recourse to borrowing from other compensation schemes; access to further multiple funding sources has to be ensured, including borrowing facilities; schemes should publish details about their level of funding. Borrowing last resort mechanism between national schemes : together with the establishment of consistent funding rules between Member States, the introduction of cooperation arrangements among national schemes will provide greater protection to investors and promote investor confidence in investment services. The system is based on the principle of solidarity between the national schemes. A borrowing mechanism among schemes is introduced as a last resort tool. These measures should provide schemes with an alternative back up source of funding, under specific conditions and on a temporary basis. Detailed funding principles and a repayment (mid-term) obligation upon the borrowing scheme will limit the risk of moral hazard between undersized and better funded schemes. Under the proposal: schemes should have the right to borrow from the other schemes if their funds are insufficient to cover their immediate needs; a portion of ex-ante funding in each compensation scheme will have to be available for lending to other schemes; ESMA should receive any borrowing request, assess whether the relevant requirements are met and, if this is the case, transmit it to the other schemes; loans should be repaid to the lending schemes at the latest after 5 years since the request. Interests should accrue on the loans; the interest rate shall be equivalent to the marginal lending facility rate of the ECB; the borrowing mechanism should be limited to the claims covered under the Directive. For instance, schemes will not be able to borrow for any needs arising from the default of entities not included in the scope of the directive; a limit of 20% of the portion set aside for lending may be used for each case. Compensation limit (\"co-insurance principle\"): the ICSD allows Member states to limit the coverage of the compensation to a specified percentage (equal to or exceeding 90%) of an investor's claim. The reason for this option in the ICSD was to encourage investors to take some care in choosing investment firms, but it is unrealistic to expect retail investors to be able to identify which firms are more or less likely to be affected by fraud or systems failures. Eliminating this option will provide increased investor protection under the ICSD as clients will no longer have to bear part of the loss if there is fraud at a firm or other problems with the firm's systems. Moreover, the provision giving Member States the option of excluding from coverage of the compensation scheme funds in currencies other than of the Member States\u2019 is eliminated. This provides better protection to investors as it ensures that clients' funds are covered irrespective of the currency involved. Payout delays: the ICSD establishes a strict deadline for reimbursement (at the latest within three months). However, processing claims takes considerably longer than the limits set, possibly up to several years as evidenced by recent cases. The proposed amendment introduces the obligation for schemes to provisionally pay partial compensation based on an initial assessment of the claim if payout delay exceeds a specified time period. The level of the partial payment will amount to one third of the initial assessment of the claim. The balance will be paid out later once the claim had been fully verified. Schemes will also need the ability to recover amounts provisionally paid out if it was subsequently determined that the claim was not in fact valid. The amendments also provide that a competent authority must make a determination of whether a firm is unable to meet its obligations to investors within three months. This is to mitigate concerns about individual cases where competent authorities could be very slow to make a determination. Investor information : the ICSD requires Member States to ensure that investment firms make available to investors information about the relevant investor compensation scheme including the amount and scope of cover. Information must be made available in a readily comprehensible manner. However, concerns have been raised about how this provision has been applied in practice in the Member States. The directive is amended to require that UCITS managers disclose to investors in clear terms what is effectively covered by schemes (e.g. investment risk is usually not covered). Under this proposal the existing obligation for investment firms to provide information about compensation schemes to new clients will be supplemented by requiring further detail to be provided about what is compensated under the ICSD and how it applies in cross border situations and require them to clearly explain that certain losses (e.g. due to investment risks) are not subject to the payment of compensation under the ICSD. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union\u2019s budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council introduced a series of measures aimed at enhancing investor protection and rebuilding consumer trust in the financial services industry by increasing transparency in the retail investment market. It requires manufacturers of packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) to produce a Key Information Document (KID). The Regulation empowers the European Supervisory Authorities to prepare regulatory technical standards specifying the elements of the KID. On 6 April 2016, the ESAs jointly submitted the draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on the KID for PRIIPs to the Commission. The draft RTS were endorsed by the Commission on 30 June 2016 by adopting the Delegated Regulation on KID. During the scrutiny period, the Council raised no objections to the Commission Delegated Regulation. However, on 14 September 2016, the European Parliament rejected it. The European Parliament called on the Commission to review the provisions relating to multi-option PRIIPs, performance scenarios and comprehension alert. Moreover, the European Parliament and a large majority of Member States asked the Commission to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. Given the exceptional circumstances that have led to delays in the adoption of the Delegated Regulation and in order to reduce legal uncertainty and give more time to PRIIPs manufacturers to prepare for the application of the new rules, the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 shall be deferred. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 by 12 months, until 1 January 2018, in order to reduce legal uncertainty and give more time to PRIIPs manufacturers to prepare for the application of the new rules."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: before a vehicle may be put on the market, it has to fulfil all the relevant type or individual approval requirements guaranteeing an optimal level of safety and environmental standards. Following this approval, cars on the road have to be regularly submitted to periodic roadworthiness tests. The goal of roadworthiness testing is to check the functionality of safety components, the environmental performance and the compliance of a vehicle with its approval. The proposal aims at contributing to reach the target of a reduction of road fatalities by half until 2020 as laid down in the Policy Orientations on Road Safety 2011-2020. It will also contribute to the reduction of emissions in road transport linked to poor maintenance of vehicles, following the European Strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles as well as the integrated energy and climate change policy. The proposal is part of a package of measures which also includes: a proposal on the amendment of Directive 1999/37/EC on registration documents for vehicles and a proposal for a regulation on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the following options were considered: Option 1: the 'No policy change' approach where the present EU legal framework would be maintained; Option 2: the \"Soft law approach\" would consist in both better implementation and better monitoring of the application of existing legislation; Option 3: the \"Legislative approach\" would be based on two components: (a) revising upwards the minimum EU standards for periodic roadworthiness tests (PTI) and unexpected roadside inspections (RSI) and define mandatory standards; (b) in a second phase, the possible establishment of and EU harmonised data exchange system linking the existing databases. The impact assessment has shown the benefits of a combination of a soft-law approach with a regulatory approach. Therefore, the soft-law measures have been integrated into the legislative texts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the \"Roadworthiness Package\" will carry over the existing requirements laid down in the existing legislative framework related to the roadworthiness regime, which covers roadworthiness tests (Directive 2009/40/EC), roadside inspections (Directive 2000/30/EC) and rules on the registration of vehicles (Directive 1999/37/EC). The main objective of the proposal is to provide for a risk-rating system aimed at focusing inspections on vehicles operated by undertaking with poor safety records, thus rewarding vehicles operated by undertakings that are mindful of safety and the environment. The main points of the proposal are as follows: Scope : light commercial vehicles and their trailers will be included into the scope of roadside test activities as this group of vehicles does not follow the downward trend in road fatalities. Roadside inspections : to distribute better the roadside inspections by Member States a percentage of the number of registered commercial vehicles shall be inspected every year. The total percentage will not exceed the number of roadworthiness tests already performed in the Union. The selection of vehicles shall be based on the risk profile of the operators and target high risk undertakings to reduce the burden on the operators that maintain their vehicles in a proper way. Company profiling shall be based on the results of previous roadworthiness tests and roadside inspections similar. More elaborated roadside inspections shall be performed using testing equipment either by mobile inspection units or at test centres in close vicinity. The securing of cargo should be included in the roadside checks. Deficiencies detected shall be assessed according to harmonised rules related to their risk. Training and qualifications : the level of knowledge and skills of inspectors performing roadside inspectors shall meet at least the level of those conducting roadworthiness tests. National contact points : cooperation and exchange of information between Member States and with the Commission will be performed more efficiently via designated points of contact in the Member States. Commission\u2019s powers : the Commission shall be empowered to update the annexes to technical progress via delegated acts and to maintain the certificates and reporting forms in close cooperation with Member States via implementing acts including inter alia alternative test procedures based upon modern emission after-treatment systems for checking the in use NOx and particulate emissions conformity which are still under development.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (\u2018light commercial vehicles\u2019): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for bananas in the EU (EU) has traditionally provided a preferential trade regime in favour of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-exporting countries. For several ACP states, banana production for export to the EU forms an important economic activity with multiplier effects for the rest of the economy. The EU's banana CMO has been challenged since 1995 through the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Dispute Settlement Mechanism, whose Appellate Body decisions have repeatedly ruled against it. Consequently, the EU has negotiated a trade agreement on bananas within the framework of the WTO. This supports the completion of the Doha Development Agenda's (DDA) agricultural modalities and the full Doha Round. Implementation of this agreement will lead to the reduction of the ACPs' preference margin. In order to promote the gradual integration of banana-exporting ACP countries into the global economy, the EU has provided assistance to the banana sectors of a number of countries through the Special System of Assistance (SSA, 1994-1999) and the Special Framework of Assistance (SFA, 1999-2008). The SFA operated in 12 banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The SFA operated in twelve banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The external evaluation of the SFA highlights positive results, as stated in the draft Communication on the Biennial Report on the Special Framework of Assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas. Certain countries managed to enhance competitiveness, as reflected in ACP bananas' stable export volumes and EU market share (see COM(2010)0103). However, production costs in ACP countries generally remain higher than in Most Favoured Nation (MFN) countries. The results of measures to support diversification are less visible and will require more efforts. A reduction in tariff preferences for ACP banana-supplying countries will lead to additional adjustment requirements, building on the adaptation and restructuring processes underway. In view of these challenges, the Commission proposes to create an ACP Banana Accompanying Measures programme for the main ACP banana-supplying countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (\u201cDCI instrument.) The Banana Accompanying Measures to be adopted aim at: enhancing the competitiveness of the banana export sector, where this is sustainable, taking into account the situation of different stakeholders in the chain; promoting the economic diversification of banana-dependent areas; addressing broader impacts generated by the adaptation process, possibly related but not restricted to employment and social services, land use and environmental restoration, and macroeconomic stability. They will take into account the results of and experiences gained through the SSA and the SFA. The Banana Accompanying Measures are proposed as a temporary programme with a maximum duration of four years (2010-2013). The main ACP banana supplying countries are: Belize, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname. The budget for the measures is EUR 190 million. Within this amount, the Commission will fix the maximum amount available to each eligible ACP banana-supplying country for financing the actions above on the basis of a set of objective indicators. The indicators shall include trade in bananas with the EU; the importance of banana exports to the economy in the ACP country concerned; and country's level of development. The measurement of the allocation criteria shall be based on data from years preceding 2009. The Commission will adopt multi-annual support strategies and ensure that such strategies complement the geographic strategy papers of the countries concerned, and the temporary nature of these banana accompanying measures. The support strategies may be reviewed ad hoc, if necessary, but shall not be submitted to a mid-term review. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budget is EUR 190 million. The programme will be financed through appropriations under the expenditure of Heading 4 (\"The EU as a Global Player\"). It is proposed to use part of the available margin under this heading for EUR 75.9 million. Commission services have assessed the availability of funds over the period 2010-2013 in order to ascertain redeployment possibilities because of potential underutilisation, absorption constraints and/or political circumstances. The analysis leads to a proposed redeployment of EUR 95.8 million under Heading 4. For the remainder (EUR 18.3 million) the Commission proposes the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument. Lastly, it should be noted that the total financial reference amount for the implementation of the DCI Regulation over the period 2007-2013 is now EUR 17 087 million."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code). The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main codified provisions : Purpose, scope and application : this Regulation provides for the absence of border control of persons crossing the internal borders between the Member States of the European Union. It lays down rules governing border control of persons crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union. In addition, it establishes the list of persons to which it the absence of control to internal borders applies. Border checks should be carried out in such a way as to fully respect human dignity. Border control should be carried out in a professional and respectful manner and be proportionate to the objectives pursued. Types of controls : the Regulation provides that border control comprises not only checks on persons at border crossing points and surveillance between those border crossing points, but also an analysis of the risks for internal security and of the threats that may affect the security of external borders. Therefore, the Regulation sets out the conditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at border crossing points and surveillance at the border, including checks in the Schengen Information System (SIS). Since only a verification of fingerprints can confirm with certainty that a person wishing to enter the Schengen area is the person to whom the visa has been issued, provisions have been made for the use at external borders of the Visa Information System (VIS). Exceptional circumstances and controls : the Regulations stipulates that it should be possible to have checks at external borders relaxed in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances in order to avoid excessive waiting time at border crossing points. The systematic stamping of the documents of third-country nationals remains an obligation in the event of border checks being relaxed. Stamping makes it possible to establish, with certainty, the date on which, and where, the border was crossed. In order to reduce the waiting times of persons enjoying the Union right of free movement, separate lanes, indicated by uniform signs in all Member States, should, where circumstances allow, be provided at border crossing points. Separate lanes should be provided in international airports. Where it is deemed appropriate and if local circumstances so allow, Member States should consider installing separate lanes at sea and land border crossing points. Exceptional reintroduction of controls and serious threats : the reintroduction of internal border control should remain exceptional. In an area without internal border control, it is necessary to have a common response to situations seriously affecting the public policy or internal security of that area, of parts thereof, or of one or more Member States, by allowing for the temporary reintroduction of internal border control in exceptional circumstances, but without jeopardising the principle of the free movement of persons. Given the impact that such measures of last resort may have on all persons having the right to move within the area without internal border control, the conditions and procedures for reintroducing such measures should be provided for, in order to ensure that they are exceptional and that the principle of proportionality is respected. In any case, the reintroduction of internal border control should remain an exception and should only be effected as a measure of last resort, for a strictly limited scope and period of time, based on specific objective criteria and on an assessment of its necessity which should be monitored at Union level. Where a serious threat to public policy or internal security requires immediate action, a Member State should be able to reintroduce border control at its internal borders for a period not exceeding ten days. Any prolongation of that period needs to be monitored at Union level. Conditions for the reintroduction of internal border control : the reintroduction of internal border control might exceptionally be necessary in the case of terrorist incidents or threats, or because of threats posed by organised crime. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders may only be justified under a specific Union-level procedure. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders could also be justified in the case of exceptional circumstances and as a measure of last resort where the overall functioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control identified in the context of a rigorous evaluation process in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT\u2019S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the last decade, the EU railway market has witnessed profound changes, gradually introduced by three legislative \u2018railway packages\u2019 intended to open up the national markets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level, while maintaining high level of safety. However, the modal share of rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. This is why the Commission has put forward the Fourth Railway Package in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing the remaining market obstacles. This proposal for a Regulation, along with the proposal to recast Directive 2004/49/EC on rail safety and the proposal to recast Directive 2008/57/EC (interoperability) are part of this fourth package which focuses on the removal of remaining administrative and technical barriers by: establishing a common approach to safety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway undertakings active across the EU; decreasing administrative costs, accelerating administrative procedures, as well as avoiding disguised discrimination, relying on the European Railways Agency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the baseline scenario (Option 1), the Commission identified five options: Option 2: greater coordination role for the Agency in ensuring a consistent approach to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation; Option 3: European Railways Agency (ERA) as a one-stop-shop, where the final decision on certification and authorisation remains with the national safety agencies (NSAs) but ERA performs entry and exit checks of applications and of the decisions; Option 4: ERA and NSAs share competencies, where the final decision on certification and authorisation is taken by the Agency; Option 5: ERA takes over activities of NSAs in relation to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation; Option 6: horizontal measures that could be implemented to improve the competitiveness of the rail sector. The environmental impact of all the options was assessed as positive, though low. The social impact of all the options was assessed as low/marginal. It was concluded that Option 4 (combined with Option 6) was the preferred option as it provides the best balance of outcomes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation seeks to add new tasks to the European Railway Agency making it a truly European Railway Authority in the field of interoperability and safety. The Agency should in particular: play the role of European authority responsible for issuing authorisations for placing on the market for railway vehicles and for types of vehicles, safety certificates for railway undertakings and authorisations for placing in service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems; monitor national railway rules and the performance of national authorities acting in the railway interoperability and safety fields; provide independent and objective technical support, predominantly to the Commission; have a strengthened role in the field of telematics applications to ensure their consistent development and swift deployment; be given a more important role to ensure the consistent development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). The proposal also provides for the establishment of an appeal mechanism so that decisions of the Executive Director can be subject to appeal to a specialised Board of Appeal, whose decisions are, in turn, open to action before the Court of Justice. Lastly, in order to perform its tasks properly, the Agency should have legal personality and an autonomous budget funded mainly through a contribution by the Union and through fees and charges paid by applicants. It should be noted that the fourth railway package also includes: (i) a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and (ii) a proposal amending Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the new proposal for a Regulation constitutes a legislative basis for commitments in terms of budget and staff for the Agency. The implication for expenditure is estimated at EUR 161.118 million for the period 2015-2020. These figures are provisional because they depend on the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020 by the budgetary authority. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the International Science and Technology Centre ('ISTC') was set up in 1994 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was funded together with other Parties (USA, Canada, and Japan) through an international multilateral agreement for the purpose of non-proliferation of scientific and technical expertise related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Over time, other Parties joined the Agreement, i.e. Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan, Republic of Korea, Norway, Russian Federation and Tajikistan. The ISTC works at the crossroads between scientific research and non-proliferation, and has funded almost 3000 projects with a total value of over EUR 550 million. The Union contribution amounts to approximately EUR 270 million. In the latest years the concept and the work of the ISTC as a science centre evolved to take into account the changing proliferation landscape, the results of threat analyses and the evolving needs of the parties. It increasingly focused on supporting projects aiming at mitigation of broader Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear risks, not necessarily focused on scientists' redirection, but on promoting bio safety and biosecurity, physical upgrades of laboratories as well as stimulation of networking activities among relevant scientific communities. Following the 2010 announced withdrawal of the Russian Federation, that becomes effective on 15 July 2015, the Parties agreed that a new Agreement needs to be put in place in order for the Centre to effectively fulfil its mandate under changed circumstances. On 21 October 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to start negotiations. The aims set out in the negotiating directives have been fully met. In accordance with the Council Decision (EU) 2015/1989 the Agreement continuing the International Science and Technology Centre between the European Union and Euratom acting as one Party and Georgia, Japan, Norway, the Kyrgyz Republic, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Tajikistan, and the United States of America was signed on 9 December 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the central objective of the future Regulation seeking to amend the Common Fisheries Policy is to progressively eliminate discards in all EU fisheries through the introduction of a landing obligation for catches of species subject to catch limits and species covered by minimum sizes in the Mediterranean. The European Parliament in its plenary vote in February 2013 agreed the gradual introduction of the landing obligation with a starting date of 2014 for pelagic fisheries, highly migratory species and salmon in the Baltic and extending to all fisheries in the Union in the following years. Subsequently, political agreement has been reached by the European Parliament and Council on the Basic Regulation with a new start date for implementation of the landing obligation of 1 January 2015. In the framework of the reform, it is the intention of the Commission that a new technical measures framework will be developed as part of the reform which, over time, should facilitate the full implementation of the landing obligation as envisaged. However, this new framework will almost certainly not be in place in time for the first group of fisheries to be covered under the landing obligation. Therefore legislation is required to remove any legal and practical impediments to implementation on a transitional basis while this new framework is being developed. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no specific Impact Assessment has been carried out as the impacts of introducing a landing obligation have already been assessed under the impact assessment supporting the reform of the CFP. High levels of discards are identified as an important driver of the lack of environmental sustainability of the CFP in the impact assessment. CONTENT: the main action of the proposed Regulation is to facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation envisaged under the Common Fisheries Policy reform by removing all existing provisions from EU technical measures and control regulations that run contrary to the landing obligation. On the technical measures regulations several provisions contained in the current regulations contradict the landing obligation and oblige fishermen to discard. These are minimum landing sizes (MLS), catch composition rules and bycatch provisions. In particular, in order to ensure the implementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms should be amended by: requiring all unintended catches of marine organisms subject to the landing obligation caught in excess of catch composition rules should be landed and counted against quotas; replacing minimum landing sizes for marine organisms subject to the landing obligation with minimum conservation reference sizes; requiring all unintended catches of marine organisms caught in excess of bycatch provisions in specific areas, at specific times and for specified gear types to be landed and counted against quotas. In addition, in order to ensure legal certainty, provisions relating to an area closure for the protection of juvenile haddock in ICES division VIb should be amended. With the same purpose, the Commission seeks to amend: Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound; Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea; Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks; Council Regulation (EC) No 254/2002 establishing measures to be applicable in 2002 for the recovery of the stocks of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES division VIIa): Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks. Council Regulation (EC) 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy also needs to be aligned with the landing obligation. The modifications required concern changes to: fishing authorisations; recording of data on all catches particularly when below minimum conservation reference sizes; a higher margin of tolerance for catch estimates below 50 kg in logbooks and transhipment declarations; establishment of rules for remote electronic monitoring (REM) for the recording of data for monitoring the landing obligation at sea; separate stowage of catches and control of marketing of catches below minimum conservation reference sizes; establishing the conditions for the use of control observers for monitoring purposes; the definition of the violation of the landing obligation as a serious infringement."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/92/EC regulates the point of sale of insurance products so as to ensure the rights of the consumer. The Directive is a minimum harmonisation instrument containing high level principles and has been implemented in the 27 Member States in substantially different ways. The need to review IMD1 was already acknowledged during the implementation check carried out by the Commission in 2005-2008. During the discussions in the European Parliament on Directive 2009/138/EC on the risk-based approach to capitalisation and supervision of insurance undertakings (Solvency II), a specific request was furthermore made to review IMD1. Some Members of the Parliament and some consumer organisations considered that there was a need for improved policyholder protection in the aftermath of the financial crisis and that selling practices for different insurance products could be improved. In order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency, the European Parliament requested that the revision of IMD1 should take into account the ongoing revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). In November 2010, the G20 asked the OECD, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other relevant international organisations to develop common principles in the field of financial services in order to strengthen consumer protection. The current review of IMD1 should be seen in the light of these guidelines and related international initiatives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options discussed in the impact assessment were assessed against different criteria: (i) market integration for market players; (ii) customer protection and confidence; (iii) a level playing field for various market players, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the estimate of the administrative burden on the basis of an external study and industry statistics is that in view of the large number of undertakings affected (about 1 million), the proposal will result in a relatively moderate cost of, on average, about EUR 730 per undertaking. The impact assessment work finished in 2012. The European Commission Impact Assessment Board's recommendations were taken on board especially concerning the impact on SME's. In general, proportional requirements have been introduced to take account of SME's concerns and to respect the principle 'less complex products, less rules'. These intermediaries will be subject to a light touch regime. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a recast directive seeks to improve regulation in the retail insurance market in an efficient manner. It aims at ensuring a level playing field between all participants involved in the selling of insurance products and at strengthening policyholder protection. Most of the issues dealt with by the revision are already covered by the current IMD1 legal framework. In concrete terms, the IMD2 project should achieve the following improvements: \u00b7  expand the scope of application of IMD1 to all distribution channels (e.g. direct writers, car rentals, etc.). The draft directive brings within its scope certain ancillary sellers and after-sales businesses such as loss adjusters and claims handlers; \u00b7  clarify the exercise of the freedom of establishment , of the freedom to provide services, and the powers of supervisory authorities of home and host Member States in this regard; \u00b7  identify, manage and mitigate conflicts of interest; \u00b7  raise the level of harmonisation of administrative sanctions and measures for breach of key provisions of the current Directive; \u00b7  enhance the suitability and objectiveness of advice to consumers; \u00b7  ensure sellers' professional qualifications match the complexity of products sold; \u00b7  simplify and approximate the procedure for cross-border entry to insurance markets across the EU. The proposal differentiates between the different selling channels for insurance products and imposes less burdensome registration and professional qualification requirements on those selling simple insurance products. For example, the sellers of ancillary insurance products of low risk, such as car rentals and travel agents are subject to a simplified declaration procedure instead of registration as insurance intermediaries. The proposal also differentiates between the life insurance products and the general insurance products in respect of the remuneration transparency requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) should play a key role in the implementation of the new EU-wide framework and be granted specific competences in this regard. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to tasks allocated to EIOPA. The total operational expenditure (in commitment appropriations) amounts to EUR 0.844 millions for the period 2014-2016. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}]}

The Agreement seeks to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the high seas portion of the central Arctic Ocean, an area that is roughly 2.8 million square kilometres in size. Commercial fishing has never been known to occur in this area, nor is it likely to occur in the near future. However, given the changing conditions of the Arctic Ocean, the governments in question developed this Agreement in accordance with the precautionary approach to fisheries management. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. Becoming a Party to the Agreement will promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long term conservation and sustainable use of marine biological resources globally. The Agreement will establish and operate a joint programme of scientific research and monitoring with the aim of improving the understanding of the ecosystem(s) of this area and, in particular, of determining whether fish stocks might exist in this area that could be harvested on a sustainable basis. Once entered into force, the Agreement will close an important regulatory gap in the current International ocean governance framework."}]}

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union has been a Contracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (the ICCAT Convention) since 14 November 1997, following the adoption of Council Decision 86/238/EEC. The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation in the conservation and management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas through the establishment of an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the adoption by the latter of conservation and management measures which become binding on the contracting parties. In 1998, ICCAT adopted resolution 98-18 concerning the unreported and unregulated catches of tuna by large-scale longline vessels in the Convention area. Following the adoption of resolution 98-18, ICCAT identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels. As a consequence, ICCAT recommended that Contracting Parties take appropriate measures, consistent with provisions of the 1998 Resolution, to the effect that the import of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products in any form from the above mentioned countries be prohibited. As a consequence, imports to the Union of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating from these countries were prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 827/2004. In 2004, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations for the lifting of trade-restrictive measures against those three countries. As a consequence, Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 was amended by Regulation (EC) No 919/2005, so that it continued prohibiting such imports only from Bolivia and Georgia. At its 22nd regular annual meeting, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made and actions taken by Bolivia and Georgia and adopted recommendation 11-19 lifting the import prohibitions on Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products which had been imposed on those two countries. Regulation (EC) No 827/2004, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 919/2005 should therefore be repealed. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the lifting of the import prohibitions on Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products that were imposed on Bolivia and Georgia has been adopted by ICCAT, international body to which the European Union is a Contracting Party. In order to uphold its international commitments, the European Union should enact such decision into Union law and therefore repeal Regulation (EC) No 827/2004.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he unprecedented global crisis that has hit the world over the last three years has seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in the government deficit and debt position of the Member States, leading a number of them to seek financial assistance outside the framework of the Union. The full consistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established by the Treaty and the possible policy conditions attached to this financial assistance should be enshrined in Union law. The economic and financial integration of the Member States whose currency is the euro calls for a reinforced surveillance to prevent a contagion from a Member State experiencing difficulties with respect to its financial stability to the rest of the euro area. The intensity of the economic and fiscal surveillance should be commensurate to the severity of the financial difficulties encountered and should take due account of the nature of the financial assistance received, which may range from a mere precautionary support based on eligibility conditions up to a full macro-economic adjustment programme involving strict policy conditionality IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on strengthened surveillance for the euro area builds on what has already been agreed in the \u2018Six Pack\u2019 set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December. It sets out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and/or that receive or may receive financial assistance from one or several other States, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or other International Financial Institutions (IFI), such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Enhanced surveillance : the proposed Regulation strengthening economic and fiscal surveillance of euro area countries facing or threatened with serious financial instability would ensure that the surveillance of these Member States under a financial assistance programme, or facing a serious threat of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law. The Commission would be able to decide whether a Member State experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability should be subject to enhanced surveillance. The Council would be able to issue a recommendation to such Member States to request financial assistance. A Member State under enhanced surveillance shall, in consultation and cooperation with the Commission, acting in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties. The Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under surveillance to verify the progresses made in the implementation of the measures. Where it is concluded that further measures are needed and the financial situation of the Member State concerned has significant adverse effects on the financial stability of the euro area, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may recommend to the Member State concerned to seek financial assistance and to prepare a macro-economic adjustment programme. The Council may decide to make this recommendation public. Where a recommendation is made public: (a) the relevant Committee of the European Parliament may invite representatives of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views; (b) representatives of the Commission may be invited by the parliament of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views. Macro-economic adjustment programme : a Member State receiving financial assistance from one or several other States, the IMF, the EFSF or the ESM shall prepare in agreement with the Commission - acting in liaison with the ECB - a draft adjustment programme aimed at re-establishing a sound and sustainable economic and financial situation and restoring its capacity to finance itself fully on the financial markets. The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall approve the adjustment programme. The Commission, in liaison with the ECB, shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the adjustment programme . It shall - in liaison with the ECB - examine with the Member State concerned the changes that may be needed to its adjustment programme. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide on any change to be made to the adjustment programme. Post-programme surveillance : a Member State shall be under post-programme surveillance as long as a minimum of 75% of the financial assistance received from one or several other Member State(s), the EFSM, the EFSF or the ESM has not been repaid. The Council, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend the duration of the post programme surveillance.

Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a \u2018joint approach\u2019 developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to allocate the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff-rate quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows in the EU-27 and the UK over a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members, including Australia, with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. Australia has negotiating rights for 14 tariff quotas and consultation rights for 6 tariff quotas. Negotiations with Australia resulted in an agreement that was initialled on 18 December 2020 in Geneva."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the first EU Directive on motor insurance was adopted in 1972, with the dual objectives of protecting victims of motor vehicle accidents (with or without a cross-border element), and facilitating the free movement of motor vehicles between Member States. Five motor insurance Directives since 1972 progressively strengthened the Directive and enhanced its provisions; they were consolidated into Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. Motor insurance also has an impact on the free movement of persons, goods and vehicles. It should therefore be a key objective of the Union action in the field of financial services to reinforce and consolidate the internal market for motor insurance. The evaluation of the functioning of Directive 2009/103/EC concluded that the Directive was working well overall. However, four areas have been identified where targeted amendments would be appropriate: (i) compensation of victims of accidents in cases of insolvency of an insurance undertaking, (ii) minimum obligatory amounts of insurance cover, (iii) checks by Member States on vehicle insurance and (iv) the use of policyholders\u2019 claims history statements by a new insurance undertaking. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined several options for each of the problems identified. The proposed amendments aim at reducing uninsured driving, potentially reducing motor insurance premiums, and at improving the level of protection of victims of motor accidents, potentially benefitting all citizens in the EU. The proposal avoids risking large potential increases of premiums of motor insurance. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Directive 2009/103/EC on motor insurance introduces the following changes: Scope : the proposal clarifies the scope of the Directive in the light of recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union has clarified that motor vehicles are intended normally to serve as means of transport, irrespective of such vehicle's characteristics, and it has clarified that the use of such vehicles covers any use of a vehicle consistent with its normal function as a means of transport, irrespective of the terrain on which the motor vehicle is used and of whether it is stationary or in motion. Uninsured driving : Member States shall be authorised to carry out insurance checks of vehicles normally based in the territory of another Member State and of vehicles normally based in the territory of a third country entering their territory from the territory of another Member state only if, they are non-discriminatory necessary and proportionate, form part of a general system of checks on the national territory and do not require stopping of the vehicle for the purpose of such a check. Those checks have to be conducted in accordance with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. Minimum level of protection : in order to ensure the same minimum level of protection at EU level for victims of motor vehicle accidents, the proposal harmonises at EU level the minimum levels of compulsory cover for personal injury and material damage, without prejudice to any higher amounts of cover prescribed by the Member States. The Commission may adopt delegated acts to update, every five years, the harmonised minimum amounts of cover for victims in line with inflation. Insolvency of the insurer : each Member State should entrust a body set up for this purpose with the task of providing compensation for material or personal injuries caused by a vehicle insured by an undertaking which is insolvent or where, after a period of three months from the date on which the injured party submitted a claim for compensation, the insurer has not provided a reasoned reply. The injured parties would be compensated by the body in their Member State of residence. That body would be entitled to claim reimbursement from the body in the Member State where the insurance undertaking which produced the contract is established, with the latter assuming ultimate responsibility. Claims history statements : the proposal harmonises the statements relating to successful third party liability claims against the policyholder in the last five years. It ensures non-discriminatory treatment of the claims history by insurance undertakings, irrespective of nationality or previous Member State of residence of a citizen."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/EC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions have been substantially modified several times. Many of the provisions of these two directives are applicable both to credit institutions and investment firms. To ensure the consistent application of these measures, it is appropriate to merge them in order to create new legislation applicable to both types of entity. This new legislation will comprise two different legal instruments. In this proposal for a Directive, are the provisions concerning the authorisation of credit institutions and the exercise of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services. The accompanying proposal for a Regulation establishes uniform and directly applicable prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms. This new elements in this proposal comprise provisions on sanctions, effective corporate governance and provisions preventing the over-reliance on external credit ratings. Sanctions : the sanctions applicable for key violations of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), such as authorisation requirements, prudential obligations and reporting obligations, vary across Member States and do not seem always appropriate to ensure sanctions are sufficiently effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Furthermore, there is a certain divergence in the level of application of sanctions in different Member States. In its 2010 Communication \"Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial sector\", the Commission has envisaged EU legislative action to set minimum common standards on certain key issues of sanctioning regimes, to be adapted to the specifics of the different sectors. Corporate governance : strengthening corporate governance is a priority for the Commission, especially in the context of its financial markets reform and crisis prevention programme. The public consultation launched as a result of its Green Paper on corporate governance in financial institutions and remuneration policies demonstrated a broad consensus on the deficiencies of corporate governance standards and practices in the financial services sector. In a resolution, adopted in July 2010, the European Parliament also recognised the importance of strengthening corporate governance standards and practices in financial institutions. Over-reliance on external ratings : overreliance on credit ratings may lead to herding behaviour of financial actors, e.g. parallel selling-off of debt instruments after that instrument has been downgraded below investment grade, which may affect financial stability. At the international level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recently issued principles to reduce authorities\u2019 and financial institutions\u2019 reliance on external ratings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a series of options was analysed to define the legal framework for sanctioning regimes and corporate governance: the options on sanctioning regimes are expected to facilitate detection of violations and to empower competent authorities to apply appropriate sanctions. This is expected to ensure better enforcement of the CRD obligations by credit institutions, which would benefit all stakeholders; the preferred policy options improving corporate governance will help avoid excessive risk-taking by credit institutions and lower the risk of failure. It would contribute to the resilience of the banking sector and improve investor confidence The impact on credit institutions and all stakeholders (depositors, shareholders, creditors) should be positive; as regards over-reliance on external ratings, the impact assessment of the new initiative on credit rating agencies (planned for early July 2011) will; include a general chapter on over-reliance covered by these proposals. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC with regard to the coordination of national provisions governing the authorisation of the business, the acquisition of qualifying holdings, the exercise of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services, the powers of supervisory authorities of home and host Member States in this regard and the provisions governing the initial capital and the supervisory review of credit institutions and investment firms. Its main objective is to coordinate national provisions concerning the access to the activity of credit institutions and investment firms, the modalities for their governance, and their supervisory framework. The proposal seeks to ensure the smooth operation of the banking sector and restoring confidence in it by: introducing an effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctioning regime to ensure compliance with the CRD rules; development of a level playing field which minimises the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage; effective supervision of banking service providers; effective corporate governance within credit institutions which should contribute to avoid excessive risk taking. The main features of the proposal are as follows: 1) Sanctions : with a view to reinforcing and approximating the legal framework concerning sanctions and the mechanisms facilitating detection of breaches, the Directive will require Member States to comply with the following minimum rules: make provision for administrative sanctions and measures that are applicable to natural and legal persons responsible for violations, which would include credit institutions, investment companies and individuals, where appropriate; in case of a breach, a minimum set of administrative sanctions and measures should be available to competent authorities. This includes withdrawal of authorisation, cease and desist orders, public statement, dismissal of management, administrative pecuniary sanctions; the maximum level of administrative pecuniary sanctions laid down in national legislation should exceed the benefits derived from the violation if they can be determined; sanctions and measures applied should be published. Lastly, appropriate mechanism should be put in place to encourage reporting of breaches within credit institutions and investment firms. 2) Corporate governance: with a view to reinforcing the legislative framework regarding corporate governance, the proposal provides for: i) improving the effectiveness of management bodies to oversee risks; ii) improve the stature of the risk management function; and iii) ensure the effective follow-up of risk management by the supervisory authorities. The management body of a credit institution or investment firm as a whole should commit sufficient time and possess adequate knowledge, skills and experience to be able to understand the business of the credit institution and its main risk exposures. All members of the management body should be of sufficiently good repute and possess individual qualities and independence of mind which enable them to constructively challenge and oversee the decisions of the management. To avoid group think and facilitate critical challenge, management boards of credit institutions should be sufficiently diverse as regards age, gender, geographical provenance, educational and professional background. The management body should be responsible and accountable for the overall risk strategy of the credit institution or investment firm and for the adequacy of the risk management systems, taking into account the credit institution's risk profile. Credit institutions and investment firms should have an independent risk management function. 3) Over-reliance on external ratings : overall, the directive seeks to encourage banks to rely on internal ratings rather than external ones to calculate their regulatory capital requirements. In addition, it is proposed that EBA publicly discloses, on an annual basis, information on the steps taken by institutions and by supervisory authorities to reduce over-reliance on external ratings and reports on the degree of supervisory convergence in this regard. 4) Capital buffers: on the basis of Basel III, this proposal introduces two capital buffers on top of the requirements: a Capital Conservation Buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer. the Capital Conservation Buffer amounts to 2,5% of risk weighted assets, applies at all times and has to be met with capital of highest quality. It is aimed at ensuring institutions' capacity to absorb losses in stressed periods that may span a number of years; the Countercyclical Capital Buffer is set by national authorities for loans provided to natural and legal persons within their Member State. It can be set between 0% and 2.5% of risk weighted assets and has to be met by capital of highest quality likewise. If justified, authorities can even set a buffer beyond 2.5%. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer will be required during periods of excessive credit growth and released in a downturn. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the Union\u2019s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions conferring on the Commission the right to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: against the background of the unprecedented and devastating floods in Pakistan in July and August 2010, the European Council at its meeting on 16 September mandated Ministers to agree urgently a comprehensive package of short, medium and longer term measures which will help underpin Pakistan's recovery and future development. These should, inter alia, include ambitious trade measures granting, exclusively to Pakistan, increased market access to the EU through the immediate and time limited reduction of duties on key imports from Pakistan. The European Council invited the Commission to present in October a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to unilaterally suspend duties on certain imports from Pakistan for a limited period of time. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal extends autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan by suspending for a limited period of time all tariffs for certain products of export interest to Pakistan. The provision of these trade preferences would not cause any meaningful adverse effects on the domestic market of the Union and would not affect negatively least developed Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 60% of Pakistan's exports to the EU are textiles and clothing. Consequently, a large number of products proposed for liberalisation are textiles and clothing. Yet, since the product scope should be as broad as possible, it also includes other industrial and agricultural products in order not to undermine Pakistan's efforts to diversify its industries and exports base. A list of 75 dutiable products lines of importance for Pakistan's exports has been established. The selected product lines amount to almost \u20ac900 million in import value, accounting for about 27% of EU imports from Pakistan (\u20ac3.3 billion). Liberalising these 75 lines, of which one product line (ethanol) would be subject to an annual tariff rate quota of 100 000 tonnes based on past imports, would result in an estimated increase in EU imports from Pakistan of around \u20ac100 million per year compared to 2009, while lowering tariff revenue for the EU budget by slightly more than \u20ac80 million. The autonomous trade preferences will be either in the form of an exemption from customs duties upon import in the Union or in the form of tariff-rate quotas. Entitlement to benefit from the autonomous trade preferences is conditional on Pakistan's compliance with the relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto as well as involvement in effective administrative cooperation with the Union in order to prevent any risk of fraud. Given the urgency of the situation in Pakistan, the Regulation should apply as of 1 January 2011, provided that the WTO has approved the request from the Union for the waiver from its obligations under GATT Articles I and XIII. In order to ensure an immediate and sustainable impact on the economic recovery of Pakistan in the aftermath of the floods it is recommended to limit the duration of the trade preferences until 31 December 2013. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: the proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue. In total the gross loss in customs duties amounts to \u20ac82.4 million, while the net loss would be 25% lower (Member States' collection costs) at \u20ac61.8 million. These figures build on the assumption that Pakistan currently fully makes use of its preferential access to the EU market."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established in 2003 in response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases - HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis - and to the EU\u2019s commitment to achieving the United Nation\u2019s Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The first EDCTP programme (EDCTP-I 2003-2012) is now beyond its active funding period. EDCTP-I had major achievements and has so far developed eight improved medical treatments, in particular for new-borns, children or pregnant/lactating women suffering from HIV/AIDS or malaria. It has resulted in the launch of the first four African Regional Networks of Excellence promoting South-South cooperation on clinical research and more than 400 African researchers have been trained. It has also contributed to establishing the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry and the African Vaccine Regulators Forum. Despite the results and impact of EDCTP so far, the health and socio-economic burden of poverty-related diseases persists and hinders the sustainable development of developing countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa. More than one billion people, including 400 million children, are suffering from one or more poverty-related diseases, including neglected infectious diseases such as sleeping sickness and worm infections. HIV/AIDS alone kills an estimated 2 million people, while malaria and tuberculosis together kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually. Following the recommendations from the independent interim evaluation of EDCTP-I, the Belgian EU Council Presidency proposed, in November 2010, the launch of a second EDCTP joint programme (EDCTP-2) with at least ten years duration (2014-2024). On 15 June 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in which it \u2018asks the Commission, the Member States and developing countries to address MDG 5 (on improving maternal health), MDG 4 (on child mortality) and MDG 6 (on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) in a coherent and holistic way\u2019. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the external interim evaluations of the EDCTP-I and the impact assessment of the future EDCTP-2 programme call for the programme to be continued but with the next programme lasting 10 years and covering a scope that extends to other poverty-related diseases (beyond HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria) and to all phases of clinical development. The geographical focus should continue to be on sub-Saharan Africa. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 185 and Article 188(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a decision concerns the participation of the Union in a second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme (EDCTP-2) jointly undertaken by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as Switzerland and Norway. EDCTP2 shall contribute to the reduction of the social and economic burden of poverty-related diseases in developing countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, by accelerating the clinical development of effective, safe and affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases, in partnership with sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP-2 seeks to achieve the following specific objectives: an increased number of new or improved medical interventions for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other poverty-related diseases, and by the end of the programme to have delivered (i) at least one new medical intervention; (ii) to have issued at least 30 guidelines for improved or extended use of existing medical interventions; and (iii) to have progressed the clinical development of at least 20 candidate medical interventions; strengthened cooperation with sub-Saharan African countries, in particular on building their capacity for conducting clinical trials; better coordination, alignment and integration of relevant national programmes to increase the cost-effectiveness of European public investments; extended international cooperation with other public and private funders; an increased impact due to effective cooperation with relevant European Union initiatives, including its development assistance. EDCTP-2 has been conceived to complement the actions implemented under the European Development Funds and the Development Cooperation Instruments, and to respond to the Union\u2019s commitment to the 2012 Rio+20 conference conclusions on developing and achieving internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Union contribution shall be up to EUR 683 million at current prices including EFTA contribution. The envelope is in current prices. The Union contribution shall be made from the \u2018Health, demographic change and wellbeing\u2019 challenge, DG Research & Innovation envelope, as part of the implementation of Horizon 2020 \u2013 The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The maximum amount of Union contribution for administrative costs is up to EUR 41 million."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union using the procedure provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The Withdrawal Agreement contains arrangements for the application of provisions of Union law to and in the United Kingdom beyond the date the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. If that agreement enters into force, the common fisheries policy (CFP) will apply to and in the United Kingdom during the transition period in accordance with that agreement and will cease to apply at the end of that period. Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for vessels in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country and for third country fishing vessels conducting fishing operations in Union waters. Regulation (EU) 2019/498 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, adopted un March 2019 with a date of application until 31 December 2019. It provides a simplified legal framework to allow the Union to grant authorisations to United Kingdom vessels to enter Union waters and to manage authorisation requests for EU vessels entering United Kingdom waters, should reciprocal access rights to waters be confirmed and in line with the applicable rules on fishing opportunities. Such a temporary framework remains necessary for 2020 in the absence of a fisheries agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom in its new status of third country, and taking into account that the United Kingdom will not be part of Union decision making beyond the Commission Proposal on fishing opportunities (scheduled for October 2019) unless a new extension of the Article 50(3) period is requested by the United Kingdom and agreed by the European Council (Article 50). CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the period of application of these provisions to enable the issuance of fishing authorisations in each other\u2019s waters in absence of a fisheries agreement concluded with the United Kingdom as a third country, provided that the management of the relevant stocks remains sustainable and in accordance with the conditions set out in the common fisheries policy and in the Council Regulations establishing fishing opportunities. Should the Withdrawal Agreement not be ratified by 31 October 2019, and should the United Kingdom withdraw from the Union on 1 November 2019, it may not be feasible for the United Kingdom and the Union to conclude a common arrangement on the fishing opportunities for relevant stocks concerned for 2020 in time for the meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December 2019 which is scheduled to set the fishing opportunities for the following year. The absence of a common arrangement however does not as such prevent the United Kingdom and the Union from granting access to each other\u2019s waters. In that case, they would be able to issue fishing authorisations to each other's vessels provided they both meet the conditions for sustainable management of the relevant stocks. United Kingdom fishing vessels may carry out fishing operations in Union waters in accordance with the conditions set out in the Council Regulations establishing fishing opportunities for 2019 and 2020, provided that the fishing opportunities set by both the Union and the United Kingdom combined are in line with the sustainable management of the relevant stocks in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The territorial scope of this Regulation and any reference to the United Kingdom therein does not include Gibraltar. This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply from the day following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom, unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date. It should apply until 31 December 2020."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: on 16 July 2009, Iceland presented its application to the Council to become a member of the European Union. The General Affairs Council in its session on 27 July 2009, recalling the renewed consensus on enlargement expressed in the conclusions of the European Council of 14/15 December 2006, and particularly the principle that each applicant country is assessed on its own merits, decided to implement the procedure laid down in Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union. Accordingly, the Commission was invited to submit to the Council its opinion on Iceland's application. Pending the presentation of the Commission's opinion to the Council, Iceland can be considered as a potential candidate country. It is therefore necessary to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) in order to enable Iceland to benefit from the assistance provided under the umbrella of IPA for the potential candidate countries. The proposed amendments are as follows: the first amendment is introduced in Annex II and foresees including Iceland in the list of potential candidate countries; secondly, an amendment is introduced in Article 4. This Article stipulates that assistance under the regulation is provided in accordance with the general policy framework for pre-accession defined by the European and Accession Partnerships and taking due account of the Reports and the Strategy Paper comprised in the annual Enlargement package of the Commission. Considering that the European and Accession Partnerships have been designed particularly for the Western Balkans and Turkey to provide guidance for EU integration and harmonisation with acquis, and the fact that Iceland is integrated in the European Economic Area, it is necessary to introduce a minor amendment to Article 4, notably by adding a paragraph which specifies that support to Iceland is provided only on the basis of the Reports and Strategy Paper comprised in the annual Enlargement package of the Commission. This amendment will exclude the application of the European and Accession Partnerships to Iceland. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: not applicable."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. PARLIAMENT\u2019S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: network and information systems and services play a vital role in in facilitating the cross-border movement of goods, services and people. Substantial disruption of these systems in one Member State can affect other Member States and the EU as a whole. The resilience and stability of network and information systems is therefore essential to the smooth functioning of the internal market. The extent and frequency of security incidents, caused by human error or malicious attacks is increasing : the Commission\u2019s public consultation found that 57 % of respondents had experienced NIS incidents over the previous year that had a serious impact on their activities. A 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that 38% of EU internet users are concerned about the safety of online payments. There is currently no effective mechanism at EU level for effective cooperation and collaboration and for secure information sharing on NIS incidents and risks among the Member States. However, the Digital Agenda for Europe and the related Council conclusions highlighted the shared understanding that trust and security are fundamental pre-conditions for the wide uptake of information and communication technologies (ICT). This proposal is presented in connection with the joint Communication of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on a European Cybersecurity Strategy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed three different options. \u00b7 Option 1 : status quo: maintain the current approach. \u00b7 Option 2: regulatory approach, consisting of a legislative proposal establishing a common EU legal framework for NIS regarding Member State capabilities, mechanisms for EU-level cooperation, and requirements for key private players and public administrations. \u00b7 Option 3: mixed approach, combining voluntary initiatives for Member State NIS capabilities and mechanisms for EU-level cooperation with regulatory requirements for key private players and public administrations. The Commission concluded that Option 2 would have the strongest positive impacts. The quantitative assessment showed that this option would not impose a disproportionate burden on Member States. The costs for the private sector would also be limited since many of the entities concerned are already supposed to comply with existing security requirements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to effect a fundamental change in the way NIS is dealt with in the EU. It provides for regulatory obligations to create a level playing field and close existing legislative loopholes. The objectives of the proposed Directive are as follows: (1) To require all Member States to have in place a minimum level of national capabilities by establishing competent authorities for NIS, setting up Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), and adopting national NIS strategies and national NIS cooperation plans. (2) To ensure that the national competent authorities cooperate within a network enabling secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange as well as detection and response at EU level. Through this network, Member States will exchange information and cooperate, through the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) to counter NIS threats and incidents and facilitate a uniform application of the directive throughout the EU. (3) To ensure that a culture of risk management develops and that information is shared between the private and public sectors. Companies in the specific critical sectors \u2013 banking, stock exchanges, energy generation, transmission and distribution, transport (air, rail, maritime), health, internet services as well as public administrations will be required to: \u00b7 assess the risks they face and adopt appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure NIS; \u00b7 report to the competent authorities any incidents seriously compromising their networks and information systems and significantly affecting the continuity of critical services and supply of goods. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: cooperation and exchange of information between Member States should be supported by a secure infrastructure. The proposal will have EU budgetary implications only if Member States choose to adapt an existing infrastructure (e.g. sTESTA) and task the Commission to implement this under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. The one-off cost is estimated to be EUR 1 250 000 on condition that sufficient funds are available under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Alternatively, Member States can either share the one-off cost of adapting an existing infrastructure or decide to set up a new infrastructure and bear the costs, which are estimated to be approximately EUR 10 million per year. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has led to significant changes both in the framework for the adoption of delegated and implementing acts and for the conduct of trade policy. As regards the adoption of delegated and implementing acts the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union clearly distinguishes between the two: the provisions of the Treaty on delegated acts, which are set out in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, provide for the legislator to control the exercise of the Commission's powers by means of a right of revocation and/or a right of objection; the provisions of the Treaty on implementing acts, which are set out in Article 291, do not provide any role for the European Parliament and the Council to control the Commission's exercise of implementing powers. Such control can only be exercised by the Member States. A legal framework establishing the mechanisms of such control is set out in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers. As regards trade policy, the Treaty of Lisbon provides that the ordinary legislative procedure applies, meaning that for the first time the European Parliament is fully associated in the conduct of trade policy. In relation to the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 the Commission stated that it will proceed to an examination of all legislative acts in force which were not adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in order to assess if those instruments need to be adapted to the regime of delegated acts introduced by Article 290 of the TFEU. It will make the appropriate proposals as soon as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he present proposal results from the Commission's examination of the legislative acts in the field of trade policy. Legislation in the field of trade policy has not been adapted in the past to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. This proposal accompanies a first proposal the Commission has made on trade policy, referred to as \"Trade Omnibus I\") amends certain regulations relating to the common commercial policy as regards procedures where the Council was involved in decision-making which were not based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. It proposes that such procedures be converted into either delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty or implementing acts pursuant to Article 291. The current proposal examines all remaining decision-making procedures found in trade policy legislation in order to adapt them, where appropriate, to the regime for delegated acts set down in Article 290. In principle these are decision-making procedures based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC. The proposal concerns 10 basic acts. Where appropriate, the Commission proposes that certain procedures be converted into delegated acts as set down in Article 290."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: an effective control system is essential to ensure that EU fisheries are managed in a sustainable manner, which in turn ensures the long-term viability of the EU fisheries sector and protects the livelihoods of EU fishermen. The measures establishing a Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) for ensuring compliance with rules of the CFP are provided for in four different legal acts: 1) the Fisheries Control Regulation; 2) the Regulation establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA); 3) the Regulation establishing a system to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU Regulation); and 4) the Regulation on the sustainable management of the external fishing fleets (SMEF). With the exception of the SMEF regulation, which was recently revised, the current Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) was designed prior to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and as such it is not fully coherent with it. In addition, the system reflects control strategies, methodologies and challenges of more than 10 years ago, and it is not equipped to effectively address current and future needs in terms of fisheries data and fleet control, to match the constant evolution of fishing practices and techniques and to take advantage of modern and more cost-effective control technologies and data exchange systems. The current system also does not reflect new and modern Union policies recently adopted, such as the plastic strategy, the digital single market strategy, and the international ocean governance. Several discussions and exchanges of view have taken place in the Council, in the Parliament, in the Administrative Board of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with Member States and with stakeholders since the publication of all these documents. Those discussions confirmed that there is unanimous agreement among the European Institutions and among direct stakeholders that the Fisheries Control System is not effective and efficient and that, as such, it is not entirely fit for purpose to sustain the achievements of the CFP objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option selected is targeted changes to the fisheries control system (in particular regulations on fisheries control, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the European Fisheries Control Agency). Positive environmental impacts of the preferred option would encompass: reduction of overfishing, elimination of discards at sea, healthier fish stocks and proper control of marine protected areas. Main socio-economic benefits include: increased wages and competitiveness of fishing industry, especially for the small fleet; promotion of job creation (especially in ICT); improved compliance with the CFP and equal treatment of fishers. CONTENT: the specific objectives of the proposed revision of the fisheries control regime are to: bridge the gaps with the CFP and with other EU policies; simplify the legislative framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burden; improve availability, reliability and completeness of fisheries data and information, in particular of catch data, and allow exchange and sharing of information; remove obstacles that hinder the development of a culture of compliance and the equitable treatment of operators within and across Member States. The proposal contains, inter alia, the following measures: clarification of the inspection process , inspectors' duties, and masters' and operators' duties during inspections. Digitisation of inspection reports through the mandatory use of an Electronic Inspection Report System which will allow a better use and exchange of data between relevant authorities and Member States; a new list of infringements of the CFP rules, which should be qualified as serious by nature, new detailed and exhaustive list of criteria to qualify as serious certain other infringements of the CFP rules; a more reliable and complete fisheries data system providing for the full digitisation of transhipment and landing declarations, applicable to all EU fishing vessels (including those less than 12 metres in length), an electronic traceability system for all vessels, new weighing procedures for fishery products and strengthened rules for recording recreational catches; better traceability of EU and imported fishery and aquaculture products : traceability information is clarified so that it allows linking a specific lot of fishery products to a particular landing by an EU fishing vessel. Information is recorded electronically so that controls in the supply chain within the internal market are more effective and efficient; the use of remote electronic monitoring tools , in particular CCTVs, for the control of the landing obligation. Certain vessels with active fishing gears shall be fitted with a device that monitors and records engine power; improving the reporting of lost fishing gear through the use of (electronic) logbooks for all categories of vessels, the deletion of the current derogation for vessels under 12 metres to take on board the equipment necessary to recover lost gear and laying down conditions to establish EU provisions for the marking and control of fishing gear for recreational fisheries; the revision of the mandate of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to fully align its objectives with the Common Fisheries Policy and extend its inspection powers."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in June 2017, the Commission published a comprehensive fitness check evaluation on reporting and monitoring of EU environment policy and drew up an action plan. This evaluation covered 181 reporting obligations found in 58 pieces of EU environmental legislation. It was found that there is room for improvement on some cross-cutting issues (such as streamlining for a process that is more similar in all Member States) and for specific pieces of legislation: Directive 2007/2/EC (INSPIRE Directive) - Infrastructure for spatial information; Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC (i.e. Birds and Habitats Directive); Directive 2010/63/EC (Animal Testing Directive); Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register Regulation (E-PRTR)); Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 (Timber Regulation); Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 (CITES); Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (FLEGT Regulation). Issues addressed in the proposal are as follows: the relevance and need for certain reporting obligations is no longer clear; the timing and frequency for reporting obligations does not meet major policy cycle needs; the extending of access to information and the sharing with the public; the roles of the Commission and European agencies are not always clear and explicit; aligning the content, timing and procedures with the evaluation cycle under the Better Regulation agenda. The proposal is therefore designed for the purpose of regulatory fitness and simplification. CONTENT: this proposal for revision of several existing legislative acts falls under the Commission\u2019s Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT). The objectives of this \u2018alignment\u2019 proposal are: (i) to improve the evidence base for the implementation of EU environmental policy; (ii) to increase transparency for the public and; (iii) to simplify reporting in order to reduce the administrative burden. The proposal has been developed with a view to ensuring a coherent approach across the different legislative acts, as appropriate: improving transparency and subsidiarity (in 8 legal acts); aligning the timing of reporting (in 3 legal acts); clarifying the role that the Commission and, in some cases, the European Environment Agency plays in the reporting processes (in 8 legal acts); providing factual data for future evaluations (in 5 legal acts)."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the crisis caused by the COVID 19 epidemic is increasing the risks for the most vulnerable, in particular the most deprived, and may in particular disrupt the support provided by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The distribution of food and basic material assistance, as well as social inclusion support, is facing increasingly logistical and human resource constraints, notably due to the confinement and urgent need to instate social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus. Many of the volunteers, who are the backbone of the Fund, can no longer be mobilised, as they often belong to groups at a higher risk of severe illness caused by COVID-19. The Fund's main objective is to support the development of the country's capacity to provide food and basic material assistance. Specific measures must be taken as a matter of urgency in order to protect the most vulnerable from this disease and to ensure that they continue to receive assistance from the FEAD, in particular with regard to the provision of the necessary protective equipment against the disease. This initiative complements the first \u2018Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative\u2019, a package of measures proposed by the Commission on 13 March 2020 which introduced a number of important changes to provide a more effective response to the current situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in order to address the difficulties encountered by public authorities and partner organisations in implementing the FEAD during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific measures The proposed measures provide for the following:  eligibility of expenditure incurred from 1 February 2020 for FEAD operations that strengthen the capacity to respond to the coronavirus pandemic; the possibility to give Member States the exceptional possibility to apply for a co-financing rate of 100% for the accounting year 2020-2021; flexibility for Member States (i) to adjust the schemes of support to the current context, including by allowing alternative schemes of delivery through electronic vouchers (lower risk of contamination) and by allowing Member States (ii) to amend certain elements of the operational programme without requiring an adoption by Commission decision; possibility to provide the necessary protective materials and equipment to partner organisations outside the technical assistance budget; flexibility measures which reduce the administrative burden on the authorities in terms of compliance with certain legislative requirements, in particular as regards monitoring and control and audit; specific provisions regarding the eligibility of costs incurred by beneficiaries in case the delivery of food/basic material assistance or social assistance is delayed as well as for suspended and not fully implemented operations. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments set out in the FEAD Regulation. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived remains unchanged. The proposal will facilitate an acceleration of programme implementation and result in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission will carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the decline in passenger demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, air carriers have made major changes to their schedules since 1 March 2020, which have resulted in a slot utilisation rate at coordinated airports falling far below the 80% threshold imposed by the Slot Regulation. This situation is likely to continue to negatively impact air carriers up to and including winter 2024/2025. For the period starting after more than a year of waiving the \u2018use-it-or-lose-it\u2019 rule (from 1 February 2020 to 27 March 2021), which preserves air carriers\u2019 2019 grandfathered slots until the end of the winter 2021/2022 scheduling season, the Commission proposes to establish a pathway to return to a normal application of the \u2018use-it-or-lose-it\u2019 rule. The return to normal should not be sudden to avoid destabilising the aviation market to the detriment of air carriers, connectivity, EU consumers, and the environment. It should take place in line with future increases in traffic levels toward 2019 levels or by a stabilisation of air traffic to a new market situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that from the start of the summer 2021 scheduling period, the normal application of the slot utilisation requirements of the Slot Regulation should reapply, but that the rate should be set at 40/60 % instead of 80/20 %. Relief should be targeted at air carriers whose intention is to operate their grandfathered slots as soon as demand sufficiently recovers and flights are once again economically viable. Consequently, slot series newly allocated to an air carrier for the first time would not be covered by the planned relief. The proposal foresees a deadline for air carriers to return unwanted slots to the coordinator if they want to benefit from the relief. A deadline of three weeks before the planned operational date for that slot would give airports and other airport service providers visibility on the required capacity and the volume of operations that they are expected to make available adequate infrastructure, facilities and staff. The proposal also clarifies under what circumstances coordinators could withdraw slots from air carriers. The Commission could adopt delegated acts to further extend the period during which the relief applies if the COVID-19 pandemic is not resolved and continues to have a negative impact on the air transport sector, including on historical grandfather rights."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the deepening of the financial crisis in some of the Member States is undoubtedly affecting substantially the real economy due to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by the Governments to borrow money from the market. In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of rural development programmes is of particular importance as a tool for providing financial assistance to the real economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non EURO countries or from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the EURO countries. To date, six countries have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme. Hungary has received financial assistance from 2009 but has exited the support mechanism in 2010. The remaining five countries are Romania and Latvia under the BoP and Portugal, Greece, and Ireland under the EFSM. In order to help these Member States to continue the implementation of the programmes on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains provisions that allow the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the rural development programmes of these MS to be increased. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal will allow the Commission to approve higher EAFRD contribution rates for the countries concerned, for as long as they are under the support mechanisms. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed to amend Council Regulation 1698/2005 in order to allow the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the rural development programmes of the Member States concerned to be increased up to: 95% of eligible public expenditure in the regions eligible under the Convergence objective, the outermost regions and the smaller Aegean Islands; 85% of eligible public expenditure in other regions, for as long as they are under the support mechanisms. This will be a temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits the support mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of EAFRD financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. On the basis of the forecasts of expenditure sent to the Commission to date by the Member States concerned, an additional EUR 90 million from the 2011 budget if the proposal is approved in time, and EUR 470 million from the 2012 budget might be necessary to be paid out in case the Member States decide to use the maximum co-finance rate allowed. The Commission will in 2012 review the need for additional payment appropriations and if necessary propose the relevant actions to the Budgetary Authority."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the regulatory and legislative framework for retail payments in the EU has been developed over the past 12 years, with the advent of the Euro acting as an accelerating factor. One of the key practices hindering the achievement of an integrated market reasons is the widespread use of so-called Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs). At present, no legislation regulating interchange fees is in place in the EU. MIFs are collectively agreed inter-bank fees usually between the acquiring payment service providers and the issuing payment service providers belonging to a certain scheme. Such interchange fees paid by acquiring payment service providers form part of the fees they charge to merchants which merchants in turn pass on to consumers. Thus, high Interchange Fees paid by merchants result in higher final prices for goods and services, which are paid by all consumers. There currently is a wide variety of interchange fees applied within national and international payment card schemes, which gives rise to market fragmentation and prevents retailers and consumers from enjoying the benefits of an internal market for goods and services. Market entry for pan-European players remains difficult, as domestic interchange fees in EU Member States vary widely and new entrants would have to offer interchange fees at least comparable to those prevailing in each market they want to enter. The entry barriers interchange fees thus created for online and mobile payment solutions also result in less innovation. Over the last 20 years, the European Commission and national competition authorities have conducted a number of antitrust proceedings addressing anti-competitive practices in the card payment market. The General Court judgment of May 2012 confirmed the Commission's finding in its MasterCard Decision of December 2007 that MIFs restrict competition as they inflate the cost of card acceptance by merchants without leading to benefits for consumers. In its non-legislative resolution of 20 November 2012 on the Green Paper 'Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments\u201d, the Parliament took a firm position in favour of providing clarity on interchange fees to market participants and expressed itself in favour of a gradual approach leading to a ban on interchange fees through regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considers six scenarios for interchange fees. The assessment concludes that the most beneficial option appears to be a combination of: capping the level of interchange fees for cross-border transactions with consumer debit and credit cards (in the first stage) and, in a second stage, capping the level of interchange fees also for domestic transactions with consumer credit cards and consumer debit cards; a series of measures to enhance effective market functioning including the limitation of the rule allowing merchants to determine the choice of card brand at the point of sale for all cards and card-based transactions based on four party scheme models. CONTENT: the present regulation, combined with the proposed revised Payment Services Directive, proposes to create common rules for interchange fees in the European Union by introducing maximum fee levels for transactions with payment cards that are widely used by consumers and thereby difficult to refuse or surcharge by retailers. The regulation will in addition propose transparency measures to allow retailers and consumers to make better informed choices of payment instruments. Capping interchange fees : the Commission proposes to set caps for interchange fees to payment service providers of 0.2% and 0.3% for the value of the transaction for all consumer debit and credit transactions. These figures have been accepted by Visa, MasterCard and the French domestic card scheme Groupement Cartes Bancaires. During a transition period of two years, maximum levels of interchange fees are imposed for cross-border transactions (where the card holder uses their card in another Member State) or cross-border acquired transactions (where the merchant uses an acquiring PSP in another Member State) only. After a transitional period, the regulation of interchange fees for consumer cards should therefore be extended to cover also domestic interchange fees. Business rules : the proposed Regulation contains measures as regards business rules that will be applicable to all categories of card transactions and card-based payment transactions based on those. As of the entry into force of the regulation, for instance: the application of the 'Honour All Cards Rule' will be limited. No discrimination will be nonetheless allowed on the basis of the issuing bank or the provenance of the card holder and between the cards carrying the same interchange fee level; the application of any rule preventing or limiting merchants from steering customers to more efficient payments instruments ('no steering rules') will be prohibited; acquiring Payment Service Providers will provide at least monthly statements of fees to merchants, in which the fees paid by the merchant over the relevant month concerning each category of cards and each individual brand for when the acquirer provides acquiring services is specified; the application of any rule withholding merchants from disclosing to their customers fees they pay to payment services acquirers will be prohibited. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any impact on the EU budget."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: emissions and removals of greenhouse gases in LULUCF are currently covered by international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol only, up to 2020. Up to this date, the Kyoto Protocol places constraints on the EU and each of its Member States, as they need to ensure that the LULUCF sector does not yield extra emissions. However, the Kyoto Protocol will expire at the end of 2020. Consequently, governance for the LULUCF sector needs to be further developed within the EU. Currently, this is carried out under Decision No 529/2013/EU on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to LULUCF. Without a legal framework defining the applicable rules for the period post-2020, the way in which LULUCF would be included in the overall framework could be heterogeneous across the EU. The proposal is part of the legislation completing the integrated framework for climate and energy policies up to 2030 endorsed by the European Council in October 2014, to achieve the EU 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least -40% compared to 1990 levels domestically in a cost effective manner and contribute to limiting global warming. It is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the strategic framework for the Energy Union. It also aims to implement the EU\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement (December 1995) on climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in the conclusion of the impact assessment, a stand-alone LULUCF policy pillar was identified as the preferred option. This would continue to be utilised together with the commitment by each Member State to ensure that the LULUCF sector should have no net emissions on their territory (no-debit rule). CONTENT: the proposal aims to define how the LULUCF sector will contribute to an EU-wide 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in non-ETS (emission trading scheme) sectors by 2030 compared to 2005. It lays down; the commitments by Member States towards meeting the greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment of the Union for the period from 2021 to 2030; accounting rules relating to emissions and absorption linked to LULUCF activity and to verification of Member States\u2019 commitments. The mandatory scope is, in essence, forest land and agricultural land, and land for which the use has changed from or to these uses. The approach proposed discards the parallel Kyoto Protocol reporting framework and streamlines the system with the UNFCCC \"land-based\" reporting framework. The scope includes greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O. Furthermore, the proposal: provides that each Member State is to ensure that the LULUCF sector should have, after the application of the accounting rules specified in the Regulation, and taking into account the flexibilities, no net emissions on their territory (\"no-debit rule\"); lays down general rules to avoid double counting, to manage the transitions between land use categories and to account for each carbon pool, except those falling under a \"de minimis\" rule; outlines the specific accounting rules for land use changed from (deforested) and to (afforested) forest land; outlines the specific accounting rules for managed cropland, grassland and wetland, including categories of land changing from and to these categories; provides for accounting rules for managed forest land using a forest reference level to exclude the effects of natural and country-specific characteristics; lays down the accounting for harvested wood products; permits Member States to exclude emissions from natural disturbances (forest fire, pest invasion, etc.) from their accounts; provides for Member States to compensate for emissions from one land accounting category by removals from another land accounting category in their territory; outlines the requirements for Member States to ensure appropriate monitoring for accounting purposes, and establishes regular compliance checks by the Commission; amends Regulation No 525/2013/EU in order to ensure that the reporting requirements currently applying to LULUCF are continued within the framework of that Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited implications for the EU budget (EUR 1.668 million for the period 2017-2020). The Commission states that the indirect impacts on Member States\u2019 budgets will depend on the choice of national policies and measures for greenhouse gas emission reductions and other mitigation action in the land use sector covered by this initiative chosen in each specific country. The proposal eliminates one (of the existing two) reporting frameworks, streamlining the process of accounting compared to that required under the Kyoto Protocol. This will reduce the administrative costs for Member States and the European Commission. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in North East Atlantic Fisheries to which the European Union is a Contracting Party aims to ensure the long term conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources of the North East Atlantic area, providing sustainable, environmental and social benefits. For the purpose of ensuring the application of this Convention and recommendations adopted by the North East Atlantic Commission (NEAFC), measures concerning control and enforcement relating to fisheries concerned may be adopted. Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 transposes into Union law the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the NEAFC. At its Annual Meetings in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, NEAFC adopted: Recommendation 15:2013 amending the Scheme, concerning the communication of transhipments and of port of landing; Recommendation 9:2014 amending the Scheme, concerning, respectively, the definitions, a number of provisions applying to Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels and the infringement procedures; Recommendation 12:2015 amending Recommendation 9:2014 with respect to Articles 22 and 23 of the Scheme on Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels. These Recommendations were adopted with the full support of the EU in NEAFC. It is in the EU's interest therefore that they be introduced in Union law by means of the proposed regulation.

The main change, operated by Recommendation 9/2014, is the alignment of the Scheme with the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU, approved by the EU in 2011. Contracting Parties have agreed that this recommendation will enter into force on 1 July 2015. The other change, made through Recommendation 15/2013, clarifies that vessels involved in a transhipment operation in the Regulatory Area as receiving vessel shall communicate the port of landing regardless of whether the landing is to take place in a port inside or outside the Convention Area.
