Proposal: Visa Information System. Extended scope of the Visa Information System (VIS)The Visa Information System (VIS) is a European database used by authorities to monitor third-country nationals requiring a visa to travel to the Schengen area. The reform of the VIS should enable the system to better respond to security developments and migration challenges, and to optimise the management of the EU's external borders by extending its scope to long-stay visas and residence permits in order to address gaps in security information. Purpose of the VIS As regards short-stay visas, the VIS shall facilitate the exchange of data between Member States on visa applications and decisions, with a view to facilitating and accelerating the visa application procedure. With regard to long-stay visas and residence permits, the VIS shall: (i) support a high level of security in all Member States by contributing to the assessment of whether the applicant or holder of a document is considered to pose a threat to public policy, internal security; (ii) facilitate checks at external border crossing points and enhance the effectiveness of checks within the territory of the Member States. For all visas, the VIS shall assist in the identification of missing persons, in particular children, and contribute the prevention of threats to the internal security of any of the Member States, namely through the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences in appropriate and strictly defined circumstances. System architecture Members proposed that Council Decision 2004/512/EC establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) be repealed and fully integrated into the VIS Regulation. They also recommend that certain elements of the Commission's implementing decisions be included in this Regulation. The VIS would be based on a centralised architecture. The centralised services shall be duplicated to two different locations namely Strasbourg, France, hosting the principal VIS Central System, central unit (CU) and St Johann im Pongau, Austria, hosting the backup VIS Central System, backup central unit (BCU). The central VIS system, the uniform national interfaces, the web service, the carrier gateway and the VIS communication infrastructure shall share and re-use as much as technically possible the hardware and software components of respectively the entry/exist central (EES Central System), the EES national uniform interfaces, the ETIAS carrier gateway, the EES web service and the EES communication infrastructure. Data processing Processing of personal data within the VIS by each competent authority shall not result in discrimination against applicants, visa holders or applicants and holders of long-stay visas, and residence permits. It shall fully respect human dignity and integrity and fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including the right to respect for one’s private life and to the protection of personal data. Particular attention shall be paid to children, the elderly and persons with a disability and persons in need of international protection. Fingerprint data of children No fingerprints of children under the age of 6 shall be entered into VIS. Parliament proposed that the collection of fingerprints from children should be subject to stricter safeguards and a limitation on the purposes for which such data may be used to situations where it is in the best interests of the child, in particular by limiting the storage period of stored data. The biometric data of minors from the age of six shall be taken by officials trained specifically to take a minor's biometric data in a child-friendly and child-sensitive manner and in full respect of the best interests of the child. Access to the system by centralised European agencies The proposed reform shall ensure better access for Europol and law enforcement authorities to VIS data in order to identify crime victims and advance their investigations into serious crime or terrorism. In the case of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Members believe it is essential that this agency has access to the system. However, they proposed restricting access for return teams while reinforcing access to statistics for the purpose of risk analysis. Links with other systems and interoperability Parliament intends to ensure the utmost coherence with other systems, in particular ETIAS, including its safeguards. Checks against other databases should also be carried out for holders of long-stay visas and residence permits. However, in order to provide appropriate guarantees, Members specified which controls should be carried out. They also specified the specific measures following each hit, both to protect third-country nationals and to ensure the confidentiality of information. Any hit resulting from the queries which cannot automatically be confirmed by VIS shall be manually verified by the national single point of contact. Depending on the type of data triggering the hit, the hit should be assessed either by consulates or by a national single point of contact, with the latter being responsible for hits generated in particular bylaw enforcement databases or systems. Each Member State shall designate a national authority, operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which shall ensure the relevant manual verifications and assessment of hits for the purposes of this Regulation. Data transfer Personal data obtained by a Member State pursuant to this Regulation shall not be transferred or made available to any third country, international organisation or private entity established in or outside the Union. As an exception to that rule, however, it shall be possible to transfer such personal data to a third country or to an international organisation where such a transfer is subject to strict conditions and necessary in individual cases in order to assist with the identification of a third-country national in relation to his or her return. Entry into force Parliament proposed enhancing reporting mechanisms and setting a deadline of a maximum of two years to have this reformed VIS up and running.

Proposal: Visa Code. Updating the rules on short-stay visas The Regulation establishes the procedures and conditions for issuing visas for intended stays on the territory of the Member States not exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period. When applying the Regulation, Member States shall act in full compliance with Union law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Decisions on applications under the Regulation shall be taken on an individual basis. Visa applications Visa applications should be examined and decided on by consulates or, by way of derogation, central authorities. Member States should ensure that central authorities have sufficient knowledge of local circumstances of the country where the application is lodged in order to assess the migratory and security risk, as well as sufficient knowledge of the language to analyse documents, and that consulates are involved, where necessary, to conduct additional examination and interviews. A Member State may agree to represent another Member State that is competent for the purpose of examining and deciding on applications on behalf of that Member State. A Member State may also represent another Member State in a limited manner solely for the collection of applications and the enrolment of biometric identifiers. If a Member State is neither present nor represented in the third country where the applicant is to lodge the application, that Member State shall endeavour to cooperate with an external service provider. Rules for making an application Applications shall be lodged no more than six months, and for seafarers in the performance of their duties no more than nine months, before the start of the intended visit, and, as a rule, no later than 15 calendar days before the start of the intended visit. In justified individual cases of urgency, the consulate or the central authorities may allow the lodging of applications later than 15 calendar days before the start of the intended visit. Applicants may lodge their applications electronically, where available. The application form shall be signed. It may be signed manually or, where electronic signature is recognised by the Member State competent for examining and deciding on an application, electronically. Member States may require applicants to present proof of sponsorship or of private accommodation, or of both, by completing a form drawn up by each Member State, which shall indicate required information regarding the identity (surname, name, date of birth, place of birth and nationality) of the applicant. These requirements may be waived in the case of an applicant known to the consulate or the central authorities for his integrity and reliability. In justified individual cases of urgency, the decision regarding an application shall be made without delay. Visa fees Applicants shall pay a visa fee of EUR 80. The visa fee may be waived for: (i) children from the age of six years and below the age of 18 years;  (ii) holders of diplomatic and service passports;  (iii) participants in seminars, conferences, sports, cultural or educational events organised by non-profit organisations, aged 25 years or less. In individual cases, the amount of the visa fee to be charged may be waived or reduced when to do so serves to promote cultural or sporting interests, interests in the field of foreign policy, development policy and other areas of vital public interest, or for humanitarian reasons or because of international obligations. The amount of the visa fee should be revised every three years on the basis of objective assessment criteria. Multiple-entry visas A harmonised approach to the issuance of multiple-entry visas has been introduced. Such visas would be issued to regular travellers for a period of validity, progressively extending from one year to five years provided that the applicant has obtained, over the previous three years, a multiple-entry visa valid for two years and made use of it legally. Cooperation with regard to irregular migrants The amended Regulation provides for the application of restrictive measures where there is a lack of cooperation by certain third countries to readmit those of their nationals who have been apprehended in an irregular situation, and failure by those third countries to cooperate effectively in the return process.The Commission should assess regularly, at least once a year, third countries' cooperation with regard to readmission. The assessment should take into account the overall cooperation of that third country in the field of migration, in particular in the areas of border management, of prevention of and the fight against migrant smuggling and of prevention of transit of irregular migrants through its territory. Where the Commission considers that the third country is not cooperating, it should submit a proposal to the Council to adopt an implementing decision on specific restrictive provisions on processing of visas and visa fees. Where, however, the Commission considers that a third country is cooperating sufficiently, it should be possible for the Commission to submit a proposal to the Council to adopt an implementing decision, providing for reduction of the visa fee, reduction of the time within which decisions on an are to be made, or increase in the period of validity of multiple-entry visas. Refusal of a visa Applicants who have been refused a visa have the right to appeal. During the appeal procedure, the applicants should be given access to all relevant information for their case, in accordance with national law. Member States shall ensure that a procedure is in place that allows applicants to submit complaints regarding the conduct of staff at consulates and the application process. Consulates or central authorities shall keep a record of complaints and the follow-up given."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A left majority could propose to change 'The Union should use its visa policy in its cooperation with third countries, and to ensure a better balance between migration and security concerns, economic considerations and General external relations.' to 'The Union should use its visa policy in its cooperation with third countries in order to ensure a correct balance between security concerns, humanitarian economic considerations and general external relations.'"}]}

Proposal: Asylum and Migration Fund. PURPOSE: to establish the asylum and migration fund for the period 2021-2027. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council.BACKGROUND: during the refugee crisis of 2015 and 2016, the EU budget has played a decisive role in managing flows of asylum seekers and migrants. The European migration agenda adopted in May 2015 stressed the need for a consistent common policy to restore confidence in the Union’s ability to combine European and national efforts to address migration issues. In October 2017, the European Council reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive approach to managing migration flows, aimed at restoring control of external borders and reducing irregular arrivals and deaths at sea. Drawing on the lessons from the past, the Commission, in its proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, proposed to significantly increase the share of the overall EU budget devoted to migration and external border management by more than 2.6 times, including an increase in the funding allocated to decentralised bodies in this policy area. The renewed Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF) shall build on the results and investments made with the support of previous funds: the European Refugee Fund, the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals, the European Return Fund, and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for the period 2014-2020. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the asylum and migration fund for the period 2021-2027. Its scope is largely inspired by the current AMIF Regulation, while taking into account new strategic developments and the mandates of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the future European Union Agency for Asylum. The Fund shall continue to support the EU's overall policies in the field of migration, integration and return, such as support to: - strengthen and develop the Common European Asylum System (including its external dimension); - promote solidarity and shared responsibility between Member States, in particular towards those States most affected by flows of migrants and asylum seekers;- support legal migration to Member States and encourage the development of immigration strategies that respect the integration process of third-country nationals; - support capacity building in Member States and promote fair and effective return strategies as well as the development of partnerships and cooperation with third countries. Support to Member States: in addition to a basic amount of EUR 5 million allocated to Member States at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of Member States shall be allocated based on a distribution key reflecting the needs and pressures experienced by Member States in the area of integration. It is proposed to give 30% weighting to the area of asylum, 30% to the area of legal migration and integration and 40% to the area of countering irregular migration including returns. The Commission shall carry out a mid-term and a retrospective evaluation of this Regulation, including the actions implemented under the fund. A mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. The remaining 40 % should be managed through a thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for the support for specific actions, providing additional funding for dedicated actions of high EU added value. Specific attention shall be put on promoting effective returns; support for resettlement and the solidarity and responsibility efforts between the Member States. Proposed budget: the financial envelope for the implementation of the fund for the period 2021-2027 shall be EUR 10.41 billion in current prices. The financial resources shall be used as follows: - EUR 6.24 billion for actions in support of Member States in migration management programmes implemented under shared management; - EUR 4.16 billion for the thematic mechanism for specific actions to Member States, projects with a European dimension, and to address urgent needs.

Proposal: Freedom of Movement for Workers. PURPOSE: to ensure the better application of EU legislation on people’s right to work in another Member State than their own and thus to make it easier for people to exercise their rights in practice.PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council.BACKGROUND: freedom of movement for workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which the Single Market is based. It is one of the core values of the European Union and a fundamental element of EU citizenship. Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) enshrines the right of EU citizens to move to another Member State for work purposes. It specifically includes the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality as regards access to employment, remuneration and other conditions of work. It also includes the removal of unjustified obstacles to the freedom of movement of workers within the European Union. Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 details the rights derived from the freedom of movement of workers, and defines the specific areas where discrimination on the grounds of nationality is prohibited, in particular as regards: (i) access to employment; (ii) working conditions; (iii) social and tax advantages; (iv) access to training; (v) membership of trade unions; (vi) housing; and (vii) access to education for children. Article 45 TFEU and Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 are directly applicable in all Member States. Nevertheless, EU citizens who want to move or who actually move from one Member State to another for work purposes continue to face problems in exercising their rights. The difficulties they face go some way to explaining why geographical mobility between EU Member States has remained at a relatively low level: according to the EU-Labour Force Survey, in 2011, only 3.1% of the working-age European citizens (15-64) lived in an EU Member State other than their own. In April 2009, Parliament adopted a resolution detailing persisting obstacles to the cross-border enjoyment of rights. It called on the Commission to produce a list of obstacles to the exercise of EU citizens' rights, based on the results of a public consultation, and to make specific proposals to address those obstacles. More recently, in another resolution on promoting workers' mobility within the Union, Parliament called on the Commission and Member States to take measures in order to 'to guarantee…the correct implementation of the existing legislation on non-discrimination, to take practical measures to enforce the principle of equal treatment of mobile workers…' and also highlighted the gap between the rights that EU citizens have in theory and what happens in practice. There are diverse examples of obstacles and problems faced by citizens, such as: - public authorities not complying with EU law (non-conforming legislation or incorrect application) and the effect on EU migrant workers; - employers and legal advisors not complying with EU law; - EU migrant workers not having access to information or the means to ensure their rights. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in line with its policy on better regulation, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, based on an external study, which concluded in April 2012. The different policy alternatives contain a range of options representing different degrees of EU intervention: - Option 1: maintaining the status quo; - Option 2: effecting change without regulation, or - Option 3: regulating. The Impact Assessment demonstrated that a binding legislative initiative would impact tangibly on the exercise of free movement rights. The preferred option is a Directive combined with other initiatives, such as common guidelines on specific subjects to be adopted by the Technical Committee on free movement of workers (already set up under Regulation (EU) No 492/2011. A Common Guidance document would address the specific issue of the application of EU law in the field of the free movement of workers. LEGAL BASIS: Article 46 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal for a Directive aims to improve and reinforce the way in which Article 45 TFEU and Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 are applied in practice across the European Union by establishing a general common framework of appropriate provisions and measures for facilitating a better and more uniform application of rights conferred by EU law on workers and members of their families exercising their right to free movement. Scope: the proposal covers the following matters: (i) access to employment; (ii) conditions of employment and work in particular as regards remuneration and dismissal; (iii) access to social and tax advantages; (iv) membership of trade unions; (v) access to training; (vi) access to housing; and (vii) access to education for workers' children. It does not modify the scope of application of the Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 and only applies in cases of discrimination on the grounds of nationality in relation to the matters covered by that Regulation, by introducing the provisions of protection, information and support. It underpins the guarantee of equal treatment and reinforces remedies in cases of unjustified obstacles in relation to eligibility and access to employment for workers exercising their right to free movement within the European Union. The proposal introduces legal obligations in regard to the following: - means of redress: the Directive would guarantee EU migrant workers an appropriate means of redress at national level. Any EU worker who believes that he/she has been the victim of discrimination on the grounds of nationality should be able to make use of appropriate administrative and/or judicial procedures to challenge the discriminatory behaviour; the proposal covers both judicial and extra-judicial means of redress, including alternative dispute settlement mechanisms, such as conciliation and mediation; time limits for bringing actions as regards the principle of equal treatment, provided that these time limits are such that they cannot be regarded as capable of rendering virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Union law on free movement of workers; - role of associations, organisations or other legal entities: the Directive would further protect workers by ensuring that associations, organisations or other legal entities with a legitimate interest in the promotion of the rights to free movement of workers may engage in any administrative or judicial procedure on behalf or in support of EU migrant workers where there has been a violation of their rights; - national structures to provide information, support and assistance: the Directive would set up structures or bodies at a national level to promote the exercise of the right to free movement by providing information and supporting and assisting EU migrant workers who suffer from nationality based-discrimination; the proposal details the tasks of these devolved structures; - awareness raising: the Directive would raise awareness by providing employers, workers, and any other interested parties with easily accessible relevant information. The proposal leaves the choice of information tools to the Member States, but on-line or digital information with links to the existing information tools at EU level, Your Europe and EURES websites would be made compulsory; - dialogue: the Directive would require Member States, in accordance with national traditions and practices, to take adequate measures to encourage and promote dialogue with social partners and non-governmental organisations which have, in accordance with their national law and practice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of nationality. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal is expected to have limited implications on the Union budget. Expenses for an evaluation study in 2015 are estimated to not exceed EUR 300 000 and will be covered by funds available from the budget line financing the free movement of workers, coordination of social security systems and measures for migrants, including migrants from third countries. Costs for human resources (EUR 131 000 p.a.) will be covered under heading 5 of the Multiannual Financial Framework."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A [right] majority would propose to add the part 'Member States should be entitled to create and maintain certain criteria for access to their social benefits, in order to ensure that those who benefit from the national social system do have a long and continued connection to their labour markets.
