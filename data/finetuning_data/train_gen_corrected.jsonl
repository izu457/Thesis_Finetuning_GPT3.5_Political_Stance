Proposal: Listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (Kosovo). The proposed Regulation aims to transfer the reference to \u2018Kosovo\u2019 from Annex I (list of countries subject to the visa requirement) to Annex II (list of countries exempt from the visa requirement) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1806. As a result, holders of Kosovo biometric passports will benefit from visa-free travel for short stays (i.e. up to 90 days within a period of 180 days) in the EU.
