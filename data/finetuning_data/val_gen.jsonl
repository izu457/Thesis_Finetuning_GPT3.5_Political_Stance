Proposal: Asylum and Migration Fund. PURPOSE: to establish the asylum and migration fund for the period 2021-2027. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: during the refugee crisis of 2015 and 2016, the EU budget has played a decisive role in managing flows of asylum seekers and migrants. The European migration agenda adopted in May 2015 stressed the need for a consistent common policy to restore confidence in the Union’s ability to combine European and national efforts to address migration issues. In October 2017, the European Council reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive approach to managing migration flows, aimed at restoring control of external borders and reducing irregular arrivals and deaths at sea. Drawing on the lessons from the past, the Commission, in its proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, proposed to significantly increase the share of the overall EU budget devoted to migration and external border management by more than 2.6 times, including an increase in the funding allocated to decentralised bodies in this policy area. The renewed Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF) shall build on the results and investments made with the support of previous funds: the European Refugee Fund, the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals, the European Return Fund, and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for the period 2014-2020. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the asylum and migration fund for the period 2021-2027. Its scope is largely inspired by the current AMIF Regulation, while taking into account new strategic developments and the mandates of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the future European Union Agency for Asylum. The Fund shall continue to support the EU's overall policies in the field of migration, integration and return, such as support to: - strengthen and develop the Common European Asylum System (including its external dimension); - promote solidarity and shared responsibility between Member States, in particular towards those States most affected by flows of migrants and asylum seekers; - support legal migration to Member States and encourage the development of immigration strategies that respect the integration process of third-country nationals; - support capacity building in Member States and promote fair and effective return strategies as well as the development of partnerships and cooperation with third countries. Support to Member States: in addition to a basic amount of EUR 5 million allocated to Member States at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of Member States shall be allocated based on a distribution key reflecting the needs and pressures experienced by Member States in the area of integration. It is proposed to give 30% weighting to the area of asylum, 30% to the area of legal migration and integration and 40% to the area of countering irregular migration including returns. The Commission shall carry out a mid-term and a retrospective evaluation of this Regulation, including the actions implemented under the fund. A mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. The remaining 40 % should be managed through a thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for the support for specific actions, providing additional funding for dedicated actions of high EU added value. Specific attention shall be put on promoting effective returns; support for resettlement and the solidarity and responsibility efforts between the Member States. Proposed budget: the financial envelope for the implementation of the fund for the period 2021-2027 shall be EUR 10.41 billion in current prices. The financial resources shall be used as follows: - EUR 6.24 billion for actions in support of Member States in migration management programmes implemented under shared management; - EUR 4.16 billion for the thematic mechanism for specific actions to Member States, projects with a European dimension, and to address urgent needs. It should be noted that the Commission proposal concerning the multiannual financial framework provides for EUR 865 million (in current prices) to the relevant decentralised agencies for the period 2021-2027"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A [right] majority would propose to change the part 'to support legal migration to the Member States including to contribute to the integration of third-country nationals;' to 'to support legal Immigration policies on the national level in accordance with Member States’ economic needs'"}]}

Proposal: Visa Code. Updating the rules on short-stay visas The Regulation establishes the procedures and conditions for issuing visas for intended stays on the territory of the Member States not exceeding 90 days in any 180-day period. When applying the Regulation, Member States shall act in full compliance with Union law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Decisions on applications under the Regulation shall be taken on an individual basis. Visa applications Visa applications should be examined and decided on by consulates or, by way of derogation, central authorities. Member States should ensure that central authorities have sufficient knowledge of local circumstances of the country where the application is lodged in order to assess the migratory and security risk, as well as sufficient knowledge of the language to analyse documents, and that consulates are involved, where necessary, to conduct additional examination and interviews. A Member State may agree to represent another Member State that is competent for the purpose of examining and deciding on applications on behalf of that Member State. A Member State may also represent another Member State in a limited manner solely for the collection of applications and the enrolment of biometric identifiers.If a Member State is neither present nor represented in the third country where the applicant is to lodge the application, that Member State shall endeavour to cooperate with an external service provider. Rules for making an application Applications shall be lodged no more than six months, and for seafarers in the performance of their duties no more than nine months, before the start of the intended visit, and, as a rule, no later than 15 calendar days before the start of the intended visit. In justified individual cases of urgency, the consulate or the central authorities may allow the lodging of applications later than 15 calendar days before the start of the intended visit. Applicants may lodge their applications electronically, where available. The application form shall be signed. It may be signed manually or, where electronic signature is recognised by the Member State competent for examining and deciding on an application, electronically. Member States may require applicants to present proof of sponsorship or of private accommodation, or of both, by completing a form drawn up by each Member State, which shall indicate required information regarding the identity (surname, name, date of birth, place of birth and nationality) of the applicant. These requirements may be waived in the case of an applicant known to the consulate or the central authorities for his integrity and reliability. In justified individual cases of urgency, the decision regarding an application shall be made without delay. Visa fees Applicants shall pay a visa fee of EUR 80. The visa fee may be waived for: (i) children from the age of six years and below the age of 18 years;  (ii) holders of diplomatic and service passports;  (iii) participants in seminars, conferences, sports, cultural or educational events organised by non-profit organisations, aged 25 years or less. In individual cases, the amount of the visa fee to be charged may be waived or reduced when to do so serves to promote cultural or sporting interests, interests in the field of foreign policy, development policy and other areas of vital public interest, or for humanitarian reasons or because of international obligations. The amount of the visa fee should be revised every three years on the basis of objective assessment criteria. Multiple-entry visas A harmonised approach to the issuance of multiple-entry visas has been introduced. Such visas would be issued to regular travellers for a period of validity, progressively extending from one year to five years provided that the applicant has obtained, over the previous three years, a multiple-entry visa valid for two years and made use of it legally. Cooperation with regard to irregular migrants The amended Regulation provides for the application of restrictive measures where there is a lack of cooperation by certain third countries to readmit those of their nationals who have been apprehended in an irregular situation, and failure by those third countries to cooperate effectively in the return process. The Commission should assess regularly, at least once a year, third countries' cooperation with regard to readmission. The assessment should take into account the overall cooperation of that third country in the field of migration, in particular in the areas of border management, of prevention of and the fight against migrant smuggling and of prevention of transit of irregular migrants through its territory. Where the Commission considers that the third country is not cooperating, it should submit a proposal to the Council to adopt an implementing decision on specific restrictive provisions on processing of visas and visa fees. Where, however, the Commission considers that a third country is cooperating sufficiently, it should be possible for the Commission to submit a proposal to the Council to adopt an implementing decision, providing for reduction of the visa fee, reduction of the time within which decisions on an are to be made, or increase in the period of validity of multiple-entry visas. Refusal of a visa Applicants who have been refused a visa have the right to appeal. During the appeal procedure, the applicants should be given access to all relevant information for their case, in accordance with national law. Member States shall ensure that a procedure is in place that allows applicants to submit complaints regarding the conduct of staff at consulates and the application process. Consulates or central authorities shall keep a record of complaints and the follow-up given."},  {"role": "assistant", "content": "A left majority could propose to delete the part ': In case of lack of cooperation of certain third countries to readmit their nationals apprehended in an irregular situation and failure of those third countries to cooperate effectively in the return process, a restrictive and temporary application of certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 should on the basis of a transparent mechanism based on objective criteria, be applied to enhance a given third country's  cooperation on readmission of irregular migrants.'"}]}
