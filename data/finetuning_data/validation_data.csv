9889EP9,"""""European Investigation Order in criminal matters: alignment with EU rules on the protection of personal data""""",0.968,0.951,0.919,0.589,0.614,0.944,0.909,0.902,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to align the data protection rules of Directive 2014/41/EU with the principles and rules provided for in the Directive on data protection in the field of law enforcement in order to establish a strong and coherent data protection framework in the EU. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2016/680 (Data Protection Directive in the field of law enforcement) required the Commission to review, by 6 May 2019 at the latest, other legal acts adopted by the Union which regulate the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes, in order to assess the need to bring them into line with the Directive and to make, if appropriate, the necessary proposals to amend those acts to ensure a consistent approach to the protection of personal data under the Directive. The Commission set out the results of its review in a Communication of 24 June 2020 which identifies ten legal acts that should be aligned with the Directive and sets out a timetable for doing so. The list includes Directive 2014/41/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Investigation Order in criminal matters. The Commission has indicated that it will present targeted amendments to this Directive in the last quarter of 2020; this is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: the Commission proposes the deletion of Article 20 of Directive 2014/41/EU on the European Investigation Order in criminal matters. Article 20 requires that any processing of personal data under the Directive comply with Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA and the principles of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (28 January 1981) and its Additional Protocol. Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the data protection law enforcement Directive entered into force on 6 May 2016. It provides a more comprehensive and general data protection instrument. It applies to domestic and cross-border processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, including safeguarding against and preventing threats to public security. In the interests of consistency and effective protection of personal data, it is proposed that the processing of personal data under Directive 2014/41/EU should comply, where appropriate, with the rules set out in Directive (EU) 2016/680. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) should apply to the processing of personal data in the context of certain types of non-criminal proceedings referred to in Directive 2014/41/EU where they are not covered by Directive (EU) 2016/680."
2395EP9,"""""Global data collection system for ship fuel oil consumption data""""",0.887,0.901,0.959,0.151,0.509,0.88,0.877,0.78,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU) 2015/757 on the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from the maritime transport sector (EU MRV Regulation) to take into account the new International Maritime Organisation (IMO) global data collection system. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: International maritime shipping remains the only means of transportation not included in the Union's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, it emitted 13% of the total Union greenhouse gas emissions from transport. In its Resolution of February 2014 on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, Parliament noted that all sectors of the economy would need to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if the Union is to deliver its fair share of global efforts. In the future, seaborne trade volumes are likely to grow, which will lead to a significant increase of associated GHG emissions if mitigation measures are not put in place swiftly. According to a study from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), depending on future economic and energy developments, global shipping emissions could grow between 50% and 250% by 2050. The aim of the EU MRV Regulation is to collect data on shipping emissions for further policymaking and to incentivise emission reductions by providing information on ships' efficiency to relevant markets. It obliges companies to monitor, report and verify the fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and energy efficiency of their ships on voyages to and from European Economic Area (EEA) ports on an annual basis, starting from 2018. Following the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in October 2016 the IMO adopted the legal framework for a global data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships (“global IMO DCS”). Taking into account the coexistence of these two monitoring, reporting and verification systems, the Commission has examined how the two systems could be aligned in order to reduce the administrative burden on vessels, while preserving the objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is a partial alignment of the two monitoring, reporting and verification systems to help reduce the administrative burden on shipping companies, while preserving the key objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. However, this partial alignment should not change the EU MRV Regulation in terms of governance, the scope of the Regulation and its requirements for verification, transparency and reporting of CO2 emissions. Any amendment to the EU MRV Regulation should therefore be limited to aligning it with the IMO global data collection system for aspects relating to definitions, monitoring parameters and monitoring plans and templates. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2015/757 proposal aims at reducing the administrative burden for ships performing maritime transport activities that are covered by both the EU MRV Regulation and the global IMO DCS while preserving the specific objectives of the EU action in this area. Therefore, the proposal seeks to: · amend the definitions of ""company"" and ""reporting period"" and also the attribution of monitoring and reporting obligations in case of ""changes of company"". This will ensure that the same legal entities monitor and report according to similarly calculated reporting periods for their ships performing EEA-related maritime transport activities under the EU MRV Regulation and under the IMO's global data collection system; · amend the monitoring parameters: for this purpose, (i) the deadweight parameter should be provided, but the declaration of the ""cargo carried"" should remain optional; (ii) the parameter ""time at sea"" should be replaced by the parameter ""hours underway"" as defined in the IMO global data collection system; (iii) the ""distance travelled"" should be calculated according to the method provided by the IMO global data collection system in order to reduce the administrative burden; · streamline the content of monitoring plans to take into account the IMO's global data collection system, except for those provisions which are necessary to ensure that only EU-related data are monitored and reported under the EU MRV Regulation. Therefore, all provisions for ""per voyage"" monitoring should be maintained in the monitoring plan. On the other hand, some relevant features of the EU MRV Regulation should be maintained:  scope in terms of ships and activities covered under the EU MRV Regulation will be maintained (thus covering the majority of ships above 5000 GT calling at EU ports for maritime transport purposes); ships' CO2 emissions within Union ports are also to be monitored and reported separately. Also data on voyages internal to any EU Member State is to be monitored and reported so as to enable Member States authorities to have robust and comparable data of their national shipping emissions. Current MRV provisions on verification of data by accredited third parties are to be kept ; the EU MRV Regulation provisions on publication of individual ships' data of CO2 emissions and energy efficiency is also to be kept."

The Commission has now completed its assessment on the legal acts related to the area of freedom, security and justice, including the former third pillar acquis. They are no longer relevant because of their temporary nature or because their content has been taken up by successive acts.

2407EP7,"""""Financial management for Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to financial stability""""",0.421,0.908,0.895,0.29,0.273,0.928,0.908,0.771,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to provide increased support from the EAFRD to the Member States in difficulties or threatened with severe difficulties with respect to their financial stability due to the global financial crisis. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the deepening of the financial crisis in some of the Member States is undoubtedly affecting substantially the real economy due to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by the Governments to borrow money from the market. In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of rural development programmes is of particular importance as a tool for providing financial assistance to the real economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non EURO countries or from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the EURO countries. To date, six countries have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme. Hungary has received financial assistance from 2009 but has exited the support mechanism in 2010. The remaining five countries are Romania and Latvia under the BoP and Portugal, Greece, and Ireland under the EFSM. In order to help these Member States to continue the implementation of the programmes on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains provisions that allow the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the rural development programmes of these MS to be increased. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal will allow the Commission to approve higher EAFRD contribution rates for the countries concerned, for as long as they are under the support mechanisms. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed to amend Council Regulation 1698/2005 in order to allow the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the rural development programmes of the Member States concerned to be increased up to: 95% of eligible public expenditure in the regions eligible under the Convergence objective, the outermost regions and the smaller Aegean Islands; 85% of eligible public expenditure in other regions, for as long as they are under the support mechanisms. This will be a temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits the support mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of EAFRD financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. On the basis of the forecasts of expenditure sent to the Commission to date by the Member States concerned, an additional EUR 90 million from the 2011 budget if the proposal is approved in time, and EUR 470 million from the 2012 budget might be necessary to be paid out in case the Member States decide to use the maximum co-finance rate allowed. The Commission will in 2012 review the need for additional payment appropriations and if necessary propose the relevant actions to the Budgetary Authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the present proposal takes into account recent legislative and political developments regarding the Financial Regulation (FR). For the sake of legal clarity and in order to facilitate the negotiations of the European Parliament and the Council, it merges and replaces two earlier Commission proposals on the revision of the FR in a single text and under a standard legislative format (no recast). These two earlier proposals concerned on the one hand, the triennial revision of the Financial Regulation and, on the other hand, the revision of the FR to align it with the Lisbon Treaty , including the obligations of Member States concerning internal control and audit and their resulting responsibilities in shared management. Therefore, these two earlier proposals are withdrawn. Additionally, the proposal also incorporates the changes to the FR due to the adoption of the Regulation No 1081/2010 regarding the creation of the European External Action Service ('EEAS'). LEGAL BASE AND PROCEDURE: since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the FR is to be revised in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure in Article 322 TFEU. In order to allow the legislative authority to have a global view of the proposed modifications, the Implementing Rules of the Financial Regulation (IR) are presented, in a Commission Staff working document, together with the FR in a single package. The IR, which contains more detailed provisions complementing the FR, will be adopted under the delegated powers of the Commission according to Article 290 TFEU. The present proposal does not contain any change of substance compared to the two earlier proposals , which are: (i) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Union; (ii) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. As a consequence, the working document of the Commission services concerning the Implementing Rules to the FR, which has been put forward by the Commission together with the triennial revision, remains entirely valid. CONTENT: in 2011 more than EUR 126 billion is planned for allocation to EU policies benefiting the Union and its citizens. In the current economic context it is even more important that the delivery mechanisms of the budget operate in the most efficient way and facilitate the implementation of EU policies, while securing sound treatment of European taxpayers' money. In particular, it is important that these mechanisms are: (i) simple and transparent (especially to final recipients of EU funds); (ii) provide the possibility for leverage of non-EU budget resources and at the same time (iii) strengthen the Commission's accountability for implementation of the budget. (1) Need for a reform : reform is necessary with a view to adapting the financial rules to the new requirements of budget implementation (co-financing with other donors, specific financial instruments, PPPs) or where the basic principles create disproportionate workload (interests on pre-financing) or may unduly impede efficiency (prohibition of budget implementation through private sector bodies). The award of small grants and contracts also needs to be facilitated. Furthermore, the new procedure applicable to the IR, as set out in the Lisbon Treaty, should lead to a new articulation between the FR and the IR, imposing a complete review of the whole set of financial rules. In this context, the Commission has based its proposal on the following objectives: · to introduce more flexibility in the application of budgetary principles, which should better suit operational needs and alleviate unnecessary administrative burden for recipients of Union funds; · to streamline relations with implementing partners to which the Commission entrusts the management of programmes or part of programming actions (projects), in particular taking account of the nature of the implementing partner (Member States, agencies, EIB, public and private operators, etc.) and the financial risks entailed (proportionality); · to shift the regime of grants from a real-cost based management (inputs) towards a performance-based scheme (outputs), in order to better target policy objectives and achieve significant simplification of procedural and documentary requirements for the benefit of beneficiaries, and facilitate the use of lump sums; · to ensure sound financial management while leaving significant room for manoeuvre for Authorising Officers so that they can adapt the means to their operational constraints and the financial risks they are faced with; · to modernise the system of risk management and control measures so as to make them more proportional to the probability of errors and to the cost involved. (2) Alignment with the Lisbon Treaty : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – (TFEU), which entered into force on December 1, 2009, makes important changes concerning budgetary and financial issues. These changes should be translated in the Financial Regulation and concern in particular: · the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the Treaty, and its link to annual budgetary procedure: in this regard, as a consequence of the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the TFEU, some provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management should be introduced in the Financial Regulation; · the new annual budgetary procedure and the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, which have an impact on the provisions relating to transfers and the provisional twelfths; · the new provisions introduced in Article 317 TFEU concerning the control and audit obligations of the Member States in the implementation of the budget, together with Point 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. The proposal also allows for the streamlining of the Financial Regulation in line with the Lisbon Treaty, through both technical adaptations and the deletion of obsolete provisions. TIMETABLE: the present revision of the FR occurs while preparation for the post-2013 programmes is also under way. It is important that all the actors concerned in the legislative process maintain an ambitious timetable for the present revision. They should aim at an agreement on the package (Financial Regulation and Implementing Rules) so that it could enter into application on 1 January 2012."
9419EP9,"""""Recognition of third countries certificates in inland navigation""""",1.016,0.951,0.932,0.37,0.526,0.954,0.922,0.951,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend the transitional provisions of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 on the recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation to cover certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2017/2397 lays down transitional measures concerning the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued before 18 January 2022 (the day following the expiry of the period for the transposition of the Directive). In general, the documents concerned remain valid on the EU inland waterways for which they were valid before that date, for a maximum of 10 years. However, apart from the Rhine navigation licences referred to in Directive 96/50/EC, those transitional measures do not apply to the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries that are currently recognised by Member States under their national requirements established before the entry into force of the Directive or their international agreements. Consequently, from 17 January 2022, third country documents will be recognised in the EU only once the Commission has adopted an implementing act under the Directive granting recognition in the EU to the documents issued by that third country. Given that the procedure for recognition of third country documents is based on the assessment of the certification systems in the requesting third country, it is unlikely that the recognition procedure will be completed before 17 January 2022. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to introduce transitional provisions applicable to third country documents recognised in certain Member States before 18 January 2022, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the system of recognition of third country documents provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and to avoid any disruption of the labour market in the inland waterway transport sector. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States to continue to recognise third country documents based on their national requirements established before the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 (16 January 2018). The recognition should be limited to inland waterways situated in the territory of the Member State concerned and should not apply beyond 17 January 2032. The scope of this transitional measure could only cover documents issued by a third country before the cut-off date (18 January 2023). The proposed amendment clarifies that certificates of qualification issued by a third country in exchange for the certificates covered by the transitional arrangements should be valid on all inland EU waterways, provided that the third country concerned has obtained recognition in accordance with Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and that the requirements for the exchange applied by that third country have been found to be identical to those laid down in the Directive with regard to the Member States."
9403EP8,"""""Electronic freight transport information""""",0.729,0.842,0.94,0.917,0.192,0.955,0.901,0.731,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to facilitate the electronic communication of information in freight transport. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: total freight transport in the EU has increased by almost 25 % over the last 20 years, and is projected to further increase by 51 % during 2015-2050. All this movement of goods is accompanied by a large amount of information being exchanged among a variety of parties, in both the private and the public domain. Today, this information is mostly printed on paper, in a variety of standard format documents. The fragmented legislation and the resulting lack of acceptance by authorities discourage investment in digital solutions for electronic documents. Yet the digitalisation of information exchange has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of transport and therefore to contribute to the smooth functioning of the single market. The Commission has acknowledged the need to foster acceptance and use of electronic transport documents in a number of policy initiative. The case for intervention has also been recognised by a wide range of stakeholders. This initiative is part of the third ‘Europe on the Move’ Package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017, and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a full obligation for Member State authorities to accept regulatory cargo transport information or documentation, with partially harmonised implementation. The main expected benefits are of an economic and environmental nature. The industry is expected to make savings worth EUR 20-27 billion over 2018-2040, compared to a scenario where no policy intervention at EU level is made (the baseline), thanks to reduction in administrative costs (i.e. costs related to the management and exchange of transport information and documentation). This is equivalent to 75-102 million hours saved yearly. Road transport operators, 99% of which are SMEs, are expected to benefit of about 60% of all industry administrative costs savings. Positive environmental impacts are also expected, due to a decrease in road transport’s modal share in 2030 relative to the baseline. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation contains measures to: ensure that the obligation for all competent public authorities to accept electronic freight documents/information is in place in all EU Member States; ensure that the authorities implement the obligation of acceptance in a uniform manner; ensure the interoperability of the IT systems and solutions used for the electronic exchange of freight transport information, and in particular for business-to-administration (B2A) regulatory information communication. Concretely, the proposal: lays down requirements relative to the electronic format in which regulatory transport information (eFTI) should be made available by the economic operators concerned; establishes the obligation of the Member States’ competent authorities of regulatory information made available electronically by the economic operators concerned in compliance with the conditions provided that such information meets the requirements guaranteeing its authenticity, integrity, security, etc; requires the competent authorities, eFTI services providers and economic operators concerned to take measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information processed and exchanged in accordance with this Regulation; establishes the obligation of the Commission to adopt implementing acts establishing a common data set and subsets in relation the regulatory requirements under the scope of this Regulation, and laying down common procedures and rules for access to and processing by the competent authorities of regulatory information provided electronically; sets out the functional requirements for the eFTI platforms by the means of which the regulatory information could be made available by the economic operators concerned, and empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts laying detailed rules for their implementation. The proposal contains provisions on powers delegated to the Commission to amend non-essential elements in Annex 1 to this Regulation, where the regulatory information requirements falling under the scope of this Regulation are listed."
5606EP7,"""""Copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online uses""""",0.86,0.883,0.965,0.355,0.333,0.892,0.897,0.686,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE : to protect the interests of the members, rightholders and users and to set minimum quality standards for the exercise by collecting societies of their freedom to provide multi-territorial licensing services for online uses of musical works in the internal market. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the dissemination of content which is protected by copyright and related rights and the linked services, including books, audiovisual productions and recorded music require the licensing of rights by different holders of copyright and related rights, such as authors, performers, producers and publishers. Such services may be provided offline, such as showing a film in a cinema or playing music in a concert hall, but also increasingly online. In some sectors, licences are most often granted directly by individual rightholders (e.g. film producers). In other sectors, the collective management of rights plays a very important role, in particular of authors' rights in musical works. Collecting societies enable rightholders to be remunerated for uses which they would not be in a position to control or enforce themselves, including in non-domestic markets. Moreover, they have an important social and cultural role as promoters of the diversity of cultural expressions by enabling the smallest and less popular repertoires to access the market. The Commission recommends action in two areas. · Firstly, there are significant differences in the national rules governing the functioning of collecting societies, in particular as regards their transparency and accountability towards their members and rightholders. Collective rights' management in all sectors needs to adapt in terms of the service provided to members and users as regards efficiency, accuracy, transparency and accountability. · Secondly, in the licensing of the rights of authors in musical works, online music service providers face difficulties in acquiring licences with an aggregated repertoire for the territory of more than one Member State. This situation leads to fragmentation of the EU market for these services, thereby limiting the provision of online music services by online service providers. This proposal is presented in the context of the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Europe 2020 Strategy. In its ""Single Market Act"" the Commission underlined that, in the internet age, collective management must be able to evolve towards more transnational, possibly EU-wide models of licensing. In its Communication ""A Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights"" the Commission announced that it would be proposing a legal framework for the collective management of copyright and related rights. The importance of this legislative proposal was also highlighted in the Commission's ""European Consumer Agenda"". IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment examines two groups of options to deal with: (1) options pertaining to governance and transparency standards in collecting societies are as follows: · retaining the status quo (A1); · better enforcement (A2) of existing EU law; · the codification of existing principles (A3) reflecting in legislation the principles that have emerged from the case-law of the Court of Justice, the Commission's antitrust decisions and Recommendation 2005/737/EC; · a governance and transparency framework (A4) which would codify the existing principles and provide a more elaborate framework of rules on governance and transparency, increasing the possibilities of control over collecting societies. (2) The following policy options were examined to address the complexities of the collective licensing of authors' rights in musical works for online uses: · retaining the status quo (B1); · the European Licensing Passport (B2): this would foster the voluntary repertoire aggregation for online uses of musical works at EU level and the licensing of rights through multi-territorial licensing infrastructures. It would lay down common rules for all collective licensors throughout the EU and would create competitive pressure on societies to develop more efficient licensing practices; · parallel direct licensing (B3); · extended collective licensing and country of origin principle (B4); · a centralised portal (B5). After carefully weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches, options A4 (governance and transparency framework) and B2 (European Licensing Passport) were retained. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 50(2)(g), 53 and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal for a directive aims to put in place an appropriate legal framework for the collective management of rights that are administered by collecting societies on behalf of rightholders. It aims to: · improve the standards of governance and transparency of collecting societies so that rightholders can exercise more effective control over them and help improve their management efficiency; · facilitate the multi-territorial licensing by collecting societies of authors' rights in musical works for the provision of online services. (1) Collecting societies : the proposal establishes organisational and transparency rules which apply to all types of collecting societies. It provides, inter alia: · rules governing the membership organisation of collecting societies; · rules on collecting societies’ financial management: a collecting society must: (i) specify the applicable deductions in its agreements with rightholders; (ii) assure members and rightholders fair access to any social, cultural or educational services, if funded by deductions; (iii) pay the amounts due to rightholders accurately and without undue delay and make efforts to identify rightholders. · rules on levels of disclosure: (i) information to rightholders on amounts collected and paid, management fees charged and other deductions made; (ii) information to other collecting societies on the management of rights under representation agreements; (iii) information to rightholders, other societies and users on request; (iv) annual publication of a transparency report. (2) Multi-territorial licensing by authors' collecting societies of online rights in musical works: the proposal establishes the conditions that an authors' collecting society must respect when providing multi-territorial licensing services for online rights in musical works, namely: · being able to process efficiently and transparently the data needed for the exploitation of such licences by using a time-sensitive, authoritative database containing the necessary data; · being transparent as regards the online music repertoire it represents; · offering rightholders and other societies the possibility to correct the relevant data and to ensure their accuracy; · monitoring the actual usage of the works covered by the licences, being capable of processing usage reports and invoicing; · paying rightholders and other collecting societies without delay and provide them with information on works used and financial data related to their rights (e.g. amounts collected, deductions made). In order to ensure that repertoires can be easily aggregated for the benefit of music service providers who want to offer a service as complete as possible across Europe and for the benefit of cultural diversity and consumers at large, specific safeguards will apply to ensure that the repertoire of all societies have access to multi-territorial licensing. The proposal also ensures that collecting societies put in place complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures so that these are available for members and rightholders. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he unprecedented global crisis that has hit the world over the last three years has seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in the government deficit and debt position of the Member States, leading a number of them to seek financial assistance outside the framework of the Union. The full consistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established by the Treaty and the possible policy conditions attached to this financial assistance should be enshrined in Union law. The economic and financial integration of the Member States whose currency is the euro calls for a reinforced surveillance to prevent a contagion from a Member State experiencing difficulties with respect to its financial stability to the rest of the euro area. The intensity of the economic and fiscal surveillance should be commensurate to the severity of the financial difficulties encountered and should take due account of the nature of the financial assistance received, which may range from a mere precautionary support based on eligibility conditions up to a full macro-economic adjustment programme involving strict policy conditionality IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out.

CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on strengthened surveillance for the euro area builds on what has already been agreed in the ‘Six Pack’ set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December. It sets out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and/or that receive or may receive financial assistance from one or several other States, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or other International Financial Institutions (IFI), such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Enhanced surveillance : the proposed Regulation strengthening economic and fiscal surveillance of euro area countries facing or threatened with serious financial instability would ensure that the surveillance of these Member States under a financial assistance programme, or facing a serious threat of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law. The Commission would be able to decide whether a Member State experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability should be subject to enhanced surveillance. The Council would be able to issue a recommendation to such Member States to request financial assistance. A Member State under enhanced surveillance shall, in consultation and cooperation with the Commission, acting in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties. The Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under surveillance to verify the progresses made in the implementation of the measures. Where it is concluded that further measures are needed and the financial situation of the Member State concerned has significant adverse effects on the financial stability of the euro area, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may recommend to the Member State concerned to seek financial assistance and to prepare a macro-economic adjustment programme. The Council may decide to make this recommendation public. Where a recommendation is made public: (a) the relevant Committee of the European Parliament may invite representatives of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views; (b) representatives of the Commission may be invited by the parliament of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views. Macro-economic adjustment programme : a Member State receiving financial assistance from one or several other States, the IMF, the EFSF or the ESM shall prepare in agreement with the Commission - acting in liaison with the ECB - a draft adjustment programme aimed at re-establishing a sound and sustainable economic and financial situation and restoring its capacity to finance itself fully on the financial markets. The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall approve the adjustment programme. The Commission, in liaison with the ECB, shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the adjustment programme . It shall - in liaison with the ECB - examine with the Member State concerned the changes that may be needed to its adjustment programme. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide on any change to be made to the adjustment programme. Post-programme surveillance : a Member State shall be under post-programme surveillance as long as a minimum of 75% of the financial assistance received from one or several other Member State(s), the EFSM, the EFSF or the ESM has not been repaid. The Council, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend the duration of the post programme surveillance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2016/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council harmonises national provisions concerning the distribution of insurance and reinsurance products and insurance-based investment products by insurance intermediaries, insurance companies, their employees, and ancillary insurance intermediaries in the Union. IDD entered into force on 23 February 2016 and Member States have until 23 February 2018 to transpose and apply its provisions. On 21 September 2017, the Commission adopted two Delegated Regulations supplementing IDD with regard to product oversight and governance requirements for insurance undertakings and insurance distributors and to information requirements and conduct of business rules applicable to the distribution of insurance-based investment products. In its decisions to raise no objections to the Delegated Regulations [see 2017/2854(DEA) and 2017/2855(DEA) ], the European Parliament asked the Commission to adopt a legislative proposal setting up a date of application on 1 October 2018, rather than 23 February 2018, as the date of application of the transitional measures of the IDD. The European Parliament justified this request by the fact that it was necessary to give more time to the insurance sector (which includes small operators) to better prepare for a correct and effective implementation of the IDD and to implement the technical and organisational changes required to comply with delegated regulations. Sixteen Member States supported Parliament’s proposal and further requested an extension of the transposition period until at least 1 October 2018 at least. While considering that the sector has already had a lot of time to adapt, the Commission agrees to respond to the request of the European Parliament and the Member States to postpone to 1 October 2018 the date from which Member States will be obliged to apply the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the IDD. CONTENT: the proposed amendment of Directive (EU) 2016/97 provides that by 23 February 2018 at the latest, Member States must adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with that Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons has been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 91/477/EEC. The proposed new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed Directive lays down minimum provisions on the movement of firearms in the EU as defined in Annex I (Category A - Prohibited firearms; Category B - Firearms subject to authorisation and Category C - Firearms and other weapons subject to declaration). The Directive shall be without prejudice to the application of national provisions concerning the carrying of weapons, hunting or sporting shooting, where the weapons are legally acquired and held in accordance with the Directive. It shall not apply to the acquisition or possession, in accordance with national law, of arms and ammunition by armed forces, police or public authorities. The Directive shall not affect the power of Member States to take measures to prevent illegal arms trafficking. Member States could adopt stricter provisions in their legislation than those provided for in the Directive. Marking and registration All firearms manufactured in or imported into the Union on or after 14 September 2018 should be clearly, permanently marked and registered without delay after manufacture and, at the latest, before being placed on the market, or without delay after import into the Union. Member States shall: - establish a system including at least: (a) the registration of dealers and brokers operating in the territory of that Member State; (b) the requirement for dealers and brokers to be licensed or authorised in the territory of that Member State; and (c) a check on the professional and private good repute and relevant competence of the dealer or broker concerned; - establish a computerised data file, whether centralised or decentralised, guaranteeing access by the authorised authorities to the data-filing systems in which each firearm covered by the Directive is registered; - ensure that data relating to firearms, including the relevant personal data, are kept by the competent authorities in the data files for a period of 30 years after the destruction of the firearms or essential components in question. Traceability The Directive requires dealers and brokers to keep a record of all entries and exits they make with respect to each firearm, as well as data to enable the identification and tracing of the firearm. Gunsmiths and brokers established on their territory should report firearms transactions to the competent national authorities without undue delay. Acquisition and possession Member States shall permit the acquisition and possession of firearms only by persons who have good cause and who: - are at least 18 years of age, except in relation to the acquisition, other than through purchase, and possession of firearms for hunting and target shooting, provided that in that case persons of less than 18 years of age have parental permission, or are under parental guidance or the guidance of an adult with a valid firearms or hunting licence, or are within a licensed or otherwise approved training centre; - are not likely to be a danger to themselves or others, to public order or to public safety; the fact of having been convicted of a violent intentional crime shall be considered as indicative of such danger. Member States shall: - have in place a monitoring system, which operates continuously or periodically, to ensure that the conditions for the granting of an authorisation laid down by national law are fulfilled for the entire duration of the authorisation ; - lay down rules on the proper monitoring of firearms and ammunition and rules on their proper storage under safe conditions. Member States may take all appropriate measures to prohibit the acquisition and possession of category A firearms, essential components and ammunition. They may grant category A authorisations to marksmen and sportsmen, as well as to recognised museums and, in exceptional and duly substantiated cases, to collectors, subject to strict security measures. Authorisations to possess firearms shall be subject to periodic review at intervals of not more than five years. Deactivation of firearms The risk of acoustic weapons and other types of blank-firing weapons being converted into real firearms is high. Therefore, they shall be included within the scope of Directive. Taking into consideration the high risk of reactivating improperly deactivated firearms, the Directive requires the classification of deactivated firearms under category C (firearms subject to declaration). The deactivation of firearms shall be verified by a competent authority to ensure that modifications made to a firearm render all its essential components permanently inoperable and incapable of being reactived. The Commission shall establish standards and techniques to ensure that all essential components of a firearm are rendered permanently inoperable. Semi-automatic firearms Some dangerous semi-automatic firearms have now been added to category A and are therefore prohibited for civilian use. This is the case for: - short semi-automatic firearms with loading devices over 20 rounds; - long semi-automatic firearms with loading devices over 10 rounds; - semi-automatic long firearms that can be reduced to a length of less than 60 cm without losing functionality by means of a folding or telescoping stock or by a stock that can be removed without using tools. European firearms pass The European firearms pass is a document issued by the competent authorities of a Member State, upon request, to a person who becomes lawfully the holder and user of a firearm. Its maximum period of validity is five years, with the possibility of extension. The European firearms pass would be regarded as the main document required of target shooters and other persons authorised in accordance with this Directive to possess a firearm during a journey to another Member State."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of negotiating directives adopted by the Council, the Commission has negotiated the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with a view to establishing a state of the art and privileged economic relationship with Canada. Canada is a strategic partner of the European Union and they have reached an ambitious agreement which will open up new opportunities for trade and investment for economic actors on both sides of the Atlantic. Both sides have also underlined through this agreement the importance of economic activity taking place within a framework of clear and transparent regulation defined by public authorities, and that they consider the right to regulate in the public interest as a basic underlying principle of the Agreement. The CETA negotiations were completed and initialled at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 1 August 2014. It is now necessary to conclude this comprehensive agreement on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt a Decision to conclude the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part. Aim of the Agreement: the CETA is a comprehensive trade and investment agreement which contains provisions on: Specific trade aim: CETA will significantly improve business opportunities for European companies in Canada. With CETA, European companies will receive the best treatment that Canada has ever offered to any trading partner, thus levelling the playing field on the Canadian market for EU companies. By opening markets, CETA should support growth and jobs in the EU and bring further benefits for European consumers. It has the potential to keep prices down and provide consumers with greater choice of quality products. CETA will not change EU standards. Standards and regulations related to food safety, product safety, consumer protection, health, environment, social or labour standards etc. will remain untouched. All imports from Canada will have to satisfy all EU product rules and regulations – without exception. Institutional component of the Agreement: the Agreement establishes a CETA Joint Committee that will continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of this agreement. The CETA Joint Committee is comprised of representatives of the European Union and representatives of Canada who will meet once a year or at the request of a Party and will supervise the work of all specialised committees and other bodies established under this Agreement. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the CETA will be the first to incorporate the new Investment Court System (ICS) in the context of the Investment Dispute Resolution System. Accordingly, an amount of EUR 500 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2017 onwards (subject to ratification) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal. It is estimated that foregone duty will reach an amount of EUR 311 million upon full implementation of the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: the Convention on Future Multilateral co-operation in North East Atlantic Fisheries to which European Community is a Contracting Party aims to ensure the long term conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources of the North East Atlantic area, providing sustainable, environmental and social benefits. For the purpose of ensuring the application of this Convention and recommendations adopted by the North East Atlantic Commission (NEAFC), measures concerning control and enforcement relating to fisheries concerned may be adopted. The Scheme of control and enforcement applies to all vessels used or intended for use for fishing activities conducted on fishery resources in areas defined in the Convention. NEAFC adopted during its 25th annual meeting in 2006 a new Scheme to improve the control and enforcement of its recommendations. The main change is the merge of the former Scheme and the Program to promote compliance by non contracting Party vessels. The other change is the inclusion of a new Port State Control system which effectively closes European ports to landings of frozen fish, which have not been verified to be legal by the flag State of the foreign vessel. It provides new measures considering control of vessels engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fisheries. The new Port State Control Measures were last amended by a recommendation adopted by NEAFC at the 26th annual meeting. These Recommendations came into force in May 2007, February 2008 and January 2009. They are binding on the Contracting Parties under the terms of the NEAFC Convention. The Community, as a Contracting Party, should consequently apply them. Therefore, this proposal seeks to update the Community rules transposing the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). It lays down the general rules and conditions for the application by the Community of the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. Unless otherwise stated, the proposed Regulation shall apply to all Community vessels used or intended for use for fishing activities conducted on fishery resources in the Regulatory Area of the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in North-East Atlantic Fisheries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no formal impact assessment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."
3461EP7,"""""Introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at European Union airports""""",0.035,0.864,0.018,0.258,0.212,0.819,0.908,0.057,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish rules and procedures concerning the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a large number of EU citizens are exposed to high noise levels which may lead to negative health effects. An active noise management strategy is therefore necessary to mitigate the undesired effects. Such noise strategy must, however, carefully balance the interests of the affected citizens with other interests and take due account of the knock-on effects on the capacity of the whole aviation network. The process leading to a decision on noise-related operating restrictions should be consistent, evidence-based and robust to be acceptable for all stakeholders. In an effort to ensure a consistent approach to the application of noise abatement measures at airports, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) adopted a set of principles and guidance constituting the so-called ""Balanced Approach"" on noise management, which encourages ICAO Contracting States: to mitigate aviation noise through selection of the optimum local combination from a range of measures i) reducing noise at source (from use of quieter aircraft), ii) making best use of land (plan and manage the land surrounding airports; iii) introducing operational noise abatement procedures (by using specific runways, routes or procedures); and iv) imposing noise-related operating restrictions (such as a night ban or phasing out of noisier aircraft); to select the most cost-effective range of measures; not to introduce noise-related operating restrictions, unless the authority is in a position, on basis of studies and consultations, to determine whether a noise problem exists and having determined that an operating restriction is a cost-effective way of dealing with the problem. At ICAO level the EU actively supports the development of new noise standards for aircraft and invests in new technologies through Framework Programmes and the Clean Sky project. But land use planning, together with the associated insulation and compensation programmes, is a national or local competence. This proposed regulation aims to apply noise-related operating restrictions of the Balanced Approach in the EU in a consistent manner by clarifying the different steps of the decision-making process when considering operating restrictions. Consistent application of the approach should identify the most cost-effective solutions, tailor made to the specific airport situation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions in a consistent manner on an airport-by-airport basis so as to help improve the noise climate and to limit or reduce the number of people significantly affected by the harmful effects of aircraft noise, in accordance with the Balanced Approach. to facilitate the achievement of specific environmental noise abatement objectives, as laid down in Union, national and local rules, and to assess their interdependence with other environmental objectives, at the level of individual airports; to enable selection of the most cost-effective noise mitigation measures in accordance with the Balanced Approach so as to achieve the sustainable development of the airport and air traffic management network capacity from a gate-to-gate perspective. This Regulation shall apply to aircraft engaged in civil aviation. It shall not apply to aircraft engaged in military, customs, police, or similar services. The proposal introduces a new regulation to replace Directive 2002/30/EC. It clarifies and completes the requirements of that directive in relation to the following points: specification of objectives to stress link with other elements of the Balanced Approach and other instruments to manage air traffic noise. definition of allocation of responsibilities. listing of general requirements to manage noise. provision of more details on the noise assessment process. specification of stakeholders to be consulted. harmonisation of data and methods. specification of notification and introduction requirements. allowing comitology to adapt reference to noise standards to new technological progress. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by Decision 2012/419/EU, the European Council amended the status of Mayotte with regard to the Union with effect from 1 January 2014. Therefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be an overseas territory to become an outermost region within the meaning of Articles 349 and 355(1) TFEU. Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014. This proposal follows the examination of requests made by the French authorities to have the Union acquis amended through specific measures applicable to Mayotte in different areas, such as fisheries and animal health. The examination of the situation regarding Mayotte has revealed that it is necessary to protect the sensitive biological situation of its waters. In certain respects, France needs additional time to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte. The amendments proposed all relate to Regulations in the fields of fisheries and animal health. In the interest of simplicity and speediness, it has been considered expedient not to resort to individual proposals for each of the acts concerned but, where legally possible, to bundle the amendments to several acts in a single proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and Article 168(4)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in view of the specific situation in Mayotte, the Commission is proposing amendments to certain Regulations in the fields of fisheries and animal health. In the area of fisheries, the proposed amendments aim to: include the waters around Mayotte and to prohibit the use of purse-seines on tuna and tuna-like schools of fish inside the area within 24 miles from the baselines of the island in order to preserve the shoals of large migratory fish in the vicinity of the island of Mayotte; grant additional time to France to to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte, in particular in regard to the registering and control obligations in the area of fisheries, to the extent it concerns certain vessels dispersed around the island and not associated to a specific landing site. In the area of animal health, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to grant France a transitional period of five years in regard to Mayotte, which would enable it to create the infrastructure necessary for the identification, handling, transport, treatment and disposal of animal by-products. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications."
5548EP7,"""""Hercule III programme and protection of the European Union's financial interests""""",0.912,0.846,0.877,0.581,0.485,0.928,0.877,0.829,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish the programme ""Hercule III"" to fight fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. BACKGROUND: Decision 804/2004/EC established the Hercule I programme and Decision 878/2007/EC extended this programme over the period 2007 to 2013, as Hercule II. The latter placed specific emphasis on the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting to reflect the legal obligations of the Commission stemming from the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeiting Agreement with Philip Morris International signed in 2004. It was the first of the agreements signed with international cigarette manufacturers under which, in recognition of more than US$ 2 billion to be paid by them into national and the Union Budgets over periods of up to 20 years, the Commission and Member States agreed that European efforts to suppress the illegal traffic in tobacco products would be enhanced. The annual provision for Hercule was duly increased from 2007. As the legal basis for Hercule II will expire at the end of 2013, its replacement should ensure the continuity of European support for the activities carried out by the Commission and Member States in providing better information, carrying out studies and providing training or technical and scientific assistance in the fight against fraud. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the protection of the Union's financial interests against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union is a shared responsibility between the Commission and Member States. The Hercule III programme concerns this specific sphere of activity of the Commission and its cooperation with Member States’ competent authorities, as well as with the other European institutions and bodies, particularly OLAF. It is essential that there should continue to be an instrument specifically dedicated to fighting fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an impact assessment. Four options, with their impact on the budget, were considered. Option 1 : to continue the programme with the same level of funding (baseline scenario); Option 2 : to renew the Hercule programme with improved objectives and a better methodology, including in particular a higher maximum rate of co-financing for technical support such as the procurement of equipment; Option 3 : to significantly alter the distribution between the different spending objectives and put much greater support on operational and law enforcement activities; Option 4 : discontinue the Hercule programme, with the possibility of continuing some actions under other Union co-financing programmes and/or to leave other actions to the Member States. In view of the past experience, the option to renew the programme with improved objectives and a better methodology is the preferred option (option 2) with a budgetary envelope in real prices which remains similar to the current envelope (approximately EUR 15 million per year). In contrast, Option 3 would result in an imbalance to the detriment of specific support for actions of prevention and detection of fraud and it might lead to confusion with regard to the attribution of responsibilities between Member States and the European Union. Member States are primarily responsible for the fight against fraud. Discontinuing the programme would reduce expenditure at Union level, without creating real economies and offsetting resources at national level or in the framework of another Union programme. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325 TFEU. CONTENT: this proposal establishes the Hercule III programme to promote activities against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. This objective shall be measured, inter alia, through the amount of recoveries following fraud cases detected by joint actions and cross border operations, the increased percentage of successful joint operations, and the increased number of cases accepted by the criminal investigative authorities. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Purpose: the aims are to: · target exclusively the protection of the financial interests of the Union, in the context of a long term vision which is coherent with other Union objectives, on the basis of the priorities defined each year for this specific field of expertise; · allow the implementation of other Union programmes to focus on priorities other than the protection of the financial interests; · fully take into account the results of the actions already co-financed in the past in this field, including in terms of targeted beneficiaries and geographical balance; · have direct impact on not only some Member States investigations, but also on OLAF investigations. Added value: the programme in particular creates savings deriving from the collective procurement of specialised equipment and databases to be used by the stakeholders and those derived from the collective specialised training. An increased effectiveness of the cross-border operations is expected on the basis of common technical standards and joint training. The Programme shall contribute to: · developing the activities at Union level and the Member States to counter fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, including the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting; · an increased transnational cooperation at the Union level and in particular to the effectiveness of the cross-border operations; · an effective prevention of fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, by offering joint specialised training for staff of national, regional administrations and to other stakeholders. Bodies eligible for funding : these are (i) national or regional administrations of a Member State or a third country which promote the strengthening of action at Union level to protect the Union's financial interests; (ii) research and educational institutes and non-profit making entities provided that they have been established and have been operating for at least one year, in a Member State or in a third country. Eligible actions : the Programme shall provide financial support for the following actions: (a) Provision of specialised technical assistance for national authorities through: · providing specific knowledge, specialised and technically advanced equipment and effective information technology (IT) tools facilitating transnational cooperation and cooperation with the Commission; · ensuring the necessary support and facilitating investigations, in particular the setting up of joint investigation teams and cross border operations; · supporting Member States' capacity to store and destroy seized cigarettes as well as independent analytical services for the analysis of seized cigarettes; · enhancing staff exchanges for specific projects, in particular in the field of the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting; · providing technical and operational support for the law enforcement authorities of the Member States in their fight against illegal cross border activities and fraud affecting the Union financial interests, including in particular support for customs authorities; · building information technology capacity throughout the Member States and third countries by providing specific databases and IT tools facilitating data access and analysis; · increasing data exchange, developing and providing IT tools for investigations, and monitoring intelligence work. (b) Organisation of specialised training, and risk analysis training workshops, as well as conferences, aimed at: · further fostering better understanding of Union and national mechanisms; · exchanging experience between the relevant authorities in Member States, and third countries as well as representatives of international organisations, including specialised law enforcement services; · coordinating the activities of Member States, third countries, and international public organisations; · disseminating knowledge, particularly on better identification of risk for investigative purposes; · developing high-profile research activities, including studies; · improving cooperation between practitioners and academics; · further raising the awareness of the judiciary and other branches of the legal profession for the protection of the financial interests of the Union. (c) Any other action, provided by the annual work programmes, which is necessary for attaining the general and specific objectives provided for in the text. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the programme will cover the period 2014-2020, and the overall budgetary envelope is EUR 110 000 000 in current prices. This amount is in line with the Commission's Communication on the next Multi-Annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: ''A Budget for Europe 2020''."

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial statement annexed to the draft Agreement foresees an overall envelope of EUR 2 732 million in commitment and payment appropriations from 2015 to 2018 (including administrative expenditure for the management of the Agreement)."
3048EP8,"""""Use of Passenger Name Record data (EU PNR)""""",0.914,0.851,0.0,0.146,0.115,0.687,0.785,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to provide a legal framework on the on the use of Passenger Name Record data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Commission adopted, on Tuesday 6 November, a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. This proposal has been subject to in-depth discussions with the Working Groups in the Council and the “Justice and Home Affairs” Council reviewed, in January, July and November 2008, the work carried out on this issue. The discussions enable a consensus to be reached on many of the provisions. Following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the 1 December 2009, the 2007 draft framework proposal, which had not yet been adopted by the Council, became obsolete. This new proposal replaces it and is based on the provisions of the TFEU. It takes into account the views expressed by Member States in Council discussions on the draft Framework decision, as well as the recommendations of the European Parliament as stated in its Resolution of 20 November 2008 and the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Over the last decade the EU and other parts of the world have seen an increase in serious and organised crime, such as trafficking in human beings and drugs. This proposal responds to a request for increased cooperation on organised crime and terrorism. As a response to the threat posed by serious crime and terrorism, and the abolition of internal border controls under the Schengen Convention, the EU adopted measures such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), and the anticipated Entry/Exit System are examples of such measures. The ‘Stockholm Programme’ also calls on the Commission to present a proposal for the use of PNR data to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorism and serious crime. PNR data is unverified information provided by passengers, and collected by and held in the carriers’ reservation and departure control systems for their own commercial purposes. It contains several different types of information, such as travel dates, travel itinerary, ticket information, contact details, the travel agent at which the flight was booked, means of payment used, seat number and baggage information. More systematic collection, use and retention of PNR data with respect to international flights, subject to strict data protection guarantees, would strengthen the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and is necessary to meet those threats to security and reduce the harm they cause. Given that the use of PNR data is not currently regulated at EU level, it is necessary to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal does not require air carriers to collect any additional information from passengers or to retain any data, nor does it require passengers to provide any data in addition to that already being provided to air carriers. In order to ensure compliance with the principle of proportionality, the proposal is therefore carefully limited in scope and contains strict data protection guarantees. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four main options were examined in the Impact Assessment, each containing two variables: Option A : refraining from addressing the issue at EU level and maintaining the status quo. Option B : addressing the structure of a system for collecting and processing PNR data: with option B.1: Decentralised collection and processing of data by Member States; with option B.2: Centralised collection and processing of data at EU level. Option C : addressing limitation of the purpose of the proposed measures: with option C.1: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime only; with option C.2: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and other policy objectives. Option D : addressing the modes of transport to be covered by the proposed measures: with option D.1: Air carriers only; with option D.2: Air, sea and rail carriers. The options were assessed against the following criteria: security in the EU, protection of personal data, costs to public authorities, costs for carriers/competition in the internal market and encouraging a global approach. The Impact Assessment concluded that a legislative proposal applicable to travel by air with decentralised collection of PNR data for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and other serious crime was the best policy option (combination of B1, C1 and D1). This would enhance security in the EU, while limiting the impact on the protection of personal data to the minimum and keeping costs at an acceptable level. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Directive contains several chapters which may be summarised as follows: Chapter I - General provisions : t he proposal aims to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Passenger Name Record data as set out in the annex of the proposal include, inter alia: PNR record locator; date of reservation/issue of ticket; date(s) of intended travel; name(s); addresses; billing information; seat numbers; etc. Other general remarks are also made including all available information on unaccompanied minors under 18 years, such as name and gender of the minor, age, name and contact details of guardian on departure and relationship to the minor, name and contact details of guardian on arrival and relationship to the minor, departure and arrival agent). Chapter II - Responsibilities : On Member States :e ach Member State shall set up or designate an authority competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime or a branch of such an authority to act as its ‘Passenger Information Unit’ responsible for collecting PNR data from the air carriers, storing them, analysing them and transmitting the result of the analysis to the competent authorities. The PNR data transferred by the air carriers in relation to international flights which land on or depart from the territory of each Member State shall be collected by the Passenger Information Unit of the relevant Member State. Should the PNR data transferred by air carriers include data beyond those listed in the Annex, the Passenger Information Unit shall delete such data immediately upon receipt. Member States shall ensure that the assessment criteria are set by the Passenger Information Units, in cooperation with the competent authorities. The assessment criteria shall in no circumstances be based on a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. The Passenger Information Unit of a Member State shall transfer the PNR data or the results of the processing of PNR data of the persons identified for the purpose of further examination to the relevant competent authorities of the same Member State. Such transfers shall only be made on a case-by- case basis. Obligations on air carriers :M ember States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that air carriers transfer ('push') the PNR data to the extent that such data are already collected by them, to the database of the national Passenger Information Unit of the Member State on the territory of which the international flight will land or from the territory of which the flight will depart. Air carriers shall transfer PNR data by electronic means using the common protocols and supported data formats to be adopted, or in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means ensuring an appropriate level of data security: (a) 24 to 48 hours before the scheduled time for flight departure; and (b) immediately after flight closure, that is once the passengers have boarded the aircraft in preparation for departure and it is no longer possible for further passengers to board. Member States may permit air carriers to limit the transfer to updates of the transfers. On a case-by-case basis, upon request from a Passenger Information Unit in accordance with national law, air carriers shall transfer PNR data where access earlier than that mentioned is necessary to assist in responding to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or serious crime. Transfer of data to third countries : it is explicitly stated that a Member State may transfer PNR data to a third country under strict and limited conditions and with express authorisation from the Member States for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. Period of data retention : Member States shall ensure that the PNR data provided by the air carriers to the Passenger Information Unit are retained in a database at the Passenger Information Unit for a period of 30 days after their transfer to the Passenger Information Unit of the first Member State on whose territory the international flight is landing or departing. Upon expiry of the period of 30 days after the transfer of the PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the data shall be retained at the Passenger Information Unit for a further period of five years. During this period, all data elements which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR data relate shall be masked out. Access to the full PNR data shall be permitted only by the Head of the Passenger Information Unit for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of a terrorist offence or serious crime, and to provide the competent authorities with the results of such processing; and where it could be reasonably believed that it is necessary to carry out an investigation or prosecution. Penalties against air carriers : penalties are provided for against air carriers which, do not transmit the data required under this Directive, to the extent that they are already collected by the them, or do not do so in the required format or otherwise infringe the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Protection of personal data : the proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Each Member State shall provide that, in respect of all processing of personal data pursuant to this Directive, every passenger shall have the same right to access, the right to rectification, erasure and blocking, the right to compensation and the right to judicial redress as those adopted under national law in implementation of Articles 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. The draft Decision lays down a number of provisions which aim to: prohibit any processing of PNR data revealing a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life; ensure the traceability of all processing of PNR data by air carriers, all transfers of PNR data by Passenger Information Units and all requests by competent authorities or Passenger Information Units of other Member States and third countries; ensure that air carriers, their agents or other ticket sellers for the carriage of passengers on air service inform passengers of international flights at the time of booking a flight and at the time of purchase of a ticket in a clear and precise manner about the provision of PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the purposes of their processing, the period of data retention, their possible use to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime, the possibility of exchanging and sharing such data and their data protection rights, in particular the right to complain to a national data protection supervisory authority of their choice; lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to be imposed in case of infringements of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Chapter IV - Implementing measures : this chapter concerns common protocols and supported data formats. All transfers of PNR data by air carriers to the Passenger Information Units for the purposes of this Directive shall be made by electronic means or, in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means, for a period of one year following the adoption of the common protocols and supported data formats. The technical provisions of comitology are also provided to this effect. Chapter V - Final provisions : Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive at the latest two years after the entry into force of this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive. There will be a transitional period for the proposal in the form of a two year implementation period. There will also be a transitional collection of PNR data, aiming to achieve collection of data on all flights within 6 years from the entry into force of the Directive. The proposal includes a review clause providing for a review of the operation of the Directive four years after its transposition date and a special review of the potential extension of the scope of the Directive to cover PNR data of passengers on flights internal to the EU. Member States shall prepare a set of statistical information on PNR data provided to the Passenger Information Units. Territorial application : the application of the Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols Nos 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is to ensure an exploitation of living biological resources that is sustainable economically, environmentally and socially. The Union has been a contracting party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) since 14 November 1997. ICCAT has the authority to adopt recommendations on the conservation and management of the fisheries under its competence, which are binding on the contracting parties. As part of the measures to regulate bluefin tuna stocks and to improve the quality and reliability of statistical data, and in order to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing, ICCAT adopted a recommendation introducing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme (BCD) and a recommendation developing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme by introducing a mandatory electronic document system (eBCD). The purpose of this proposal is to transpose and implement existing ICCAT measures, which are binding upon the contracting parties. CONTENT: this proposal establishes a Union bluefin tuna catch documentation programme to implement the conservation and management measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas relating to bluefin tuna catch documentation programme and the mandatory use of the electronic bluefin tuna catch documentation system with a view to identifying the origin of all bluefin tuna. Specifically, the proposal: - lays down general provisions on the use of bluefin catch and re-export certificates and sets rules for the recording and validation of catch and subsequent trade events of bluefin tuna. Particular rules are set for tagged fish; - introduces additional provisions on verification before validation, transmission of data from eBCD users, the use of paper eBCD in exceptional cases and annual reporting to ICCAT; - sets out a detailed list of cases where delegated powers are requested to address frequent changes to the recommendations adopted by ICCAT."

BACKGROUND : the Common Aviation Area Agreement between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part has been negotiated under a mandate received from the Council in June 2009. Air services between the EU and Georgia presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Georgia. It is part of the EU neighbourhood policy to replace this network of bilateral agreements through the establishment of a Common Aviation Area between the EU and its neighbours. The negotiating mandate set the objective of establishing a Common Aviation Area (CAA) between the EU and Georgia. This would extend the rules and provisions of the single market for air transport in the EU to a large extent to Georgia in which European and Georgian airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, a draft Agreement with Georgia was initialled by the two sides on 5 March 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Agreement ensures the gradual establishment of an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area. A report prepared for the Commission in 2008 by consultants, estimated that an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area would generate 25,000 extra passengers and consumer benefits of up to EUR 17 million in the first effective year of market opening. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee which will be responsible for reviewing the implementation of the Agreement and its effects. LEGAL BASE : CONTENT : The Agreement aims at: - gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; - non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators based on the principles of the EU Treaties; - Alignment of the Georgian aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement provides for the possibility for Georgia to join the main multilateral aviation agreement with European countries, the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) signed in 2006. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the instrument of the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon and was made operational on 1 April 2012 by Regulation No 211/2011. The aim of this instrument is to enhance citizens' involvement in the democratic life of the European Union, by allowing them to directly address the Commission with a request to submit a proposal for legal acts of the Union for the purpose of implementing the Treaties. Since its first report on the application of the Regulation adopted in 2015, the Commission has implemented a series of non-legislative measures to facilitate the use of the instrument by organisers and citizens and to mitigate the main problems identified, namely: the difficulties encountered by the organisers in the registration phase including the high rate of refusals to register proposed citizens’ initiatives; the complexity for organisers of initiatives to collect statements of support, as evidenced by the low rate of successful initiatives; differences in requirements for personal data of signatories; low number of initiatives reaching the one million threshold and the limited impact so far generated by citizens' initiatives. The resolution of the European Parliament of 28 October 2015 highlighted a number of problems and called for the revision of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 and the adoption of a package of amendments to improve the functioning of the ECI. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been carried out. The Commission notes, however, that technical and practical measures to simplify the ECI should reduce the administrative burden for both organisers and Member States. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to replace Regulation No 211/2011 with a view to improving the way the ECI operates, with the main policy objectives of: making the ECI more accessible, less burdensome and easier to use for organisers and supporters; achieving the full potential of the ECI as a tool to foster debate and participation , including that of young people, at European level and to bring the EU closer to its citizens. Concretely, the proposal: stipulates the right of every citizen of the Union of at least 16 years of age to support an initiative by signing the statement of support; introduces the requirement to make available an online collaborative platform for the ECI providing a discussion forum as well as information and advice to organisers, support to organisers with regard to the translation of the main elements of their initiatives into all official languages ​​of the Union for publication in the Register; provides for the requirements for the organisers of initiatives, including the formation, composition and responsibilities of the group of organisers composed by at least seven citizens of the Union entitled to vote in the elections to the European Parliament and residents of at least seven Member States; provides that statements of support may only be collected after an initiative has been registered and establishes the requirements for the registration or refusal of initiatives; clarifies that statements of support for initiatives may be collected online or in paper form and that only forms which comply with the models set out in Annex III of the Regulation may be used to collect statements of support. Personal data to be provided by the signatory would be reduced; introduces the requirement for the Commission to set-up and operate, by 1 January 2020, a central online collection system made available free of charge to organisers of registered initiatives and allowing citizens to provide support to initiatives online; stipulates the possibility for organisers to set up their own individual online collection systems, the security and technical features for these systems and the procedure for the verification by the competent national authorities in the Member States; provides that each Member State shall verify and certify the statements of support signed by their nationals; lays down the conditions and time limits for the submission of initiatives to the Commission; sets out the publication and public hearing phase for initiatives submitted to the Commission and sets out the conditions for the public hearing at the European Parliament within three months from the submission of the initiative by the organisers; obliges the Commission to receive the group of organisers at an appropriate level as well as to set out in a Communication its legal and political conclusions on the initiative, the actions it intends to take, if any, and its reasons for taking or not taking action; provides for awareness-raising and communication activities on the ECI to be carried out by the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to a number of online systems for the European citizens’ initiative which the Commission will put in place and make available free of charge to citizens and organisers. The estimated impact on expenditure (in commitment appropriations) is estimated at EUR 2.050 million for 2019 and EUR 2.140 million for 2020. For administrative expenditure, the impact is estimated to EUR 1.071 million per year."
4580EP7,"""""Fuel quality directive and renewable energy directive""""",0.053,0.802,0.982,0.452,0.333,0.59,0.897,0.714,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to start the transition to biofuels that deliver substantial greenhouse gas savings. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/28/EC (the ""Renewable Energy Directive"") established mandatory targets of 20% overall share of renewable energy in the EU by 2020 and a 10% share for renewable energy in the transport sector. At the same time, an amendment to Directive 98/70/EC (""the Fuel Quality Directive"") introduced a mandatory target of a 6% reduction by 2020 in the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used in road transport and non-road mobile machinery. The contribution of biofuels towards these targets is expected to be significant. Whilst both Directives include sustainability criteria including minimum greenhouse gas saving thresholds, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with changes in the carbon stock of land resulting from indirect changes in land use (ILUC) are not subject to reporting requirements under the current legislation. The Commission was invited to review the impact of indirect land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions and, if appropriate, propose ways to minimise it whilst respecting existing investments made in biofuels production. The Commission Communication of 2010 identified a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the available numerical models used to quantify indirect land-use change, whilst acknowledging that indirect land-use change can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions savings associated with biofuels and bioliquids, and as such, recommended that this issue was to be addressed under a precautionary approach. Scientific work indicates that emissions from indirect land-use change can vary substantially between feedstocks and can negate some or all of the greenhouse gas savings of individual biofuels relative to the fossil fuels they replace. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to amend the existing legislation with a view to limiting the contribution that conventional biofuels (with a risk of ILUC emissions) make towards attainment of the targets in the Renewable Energy Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this Commission proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: in order to ensure an increased use of sustainable biofuels to meet the necessary targets, the Commission is proposing to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive. 1. Introduction of limits on the contribution that conventional biofuels and bioliquids produced from food crops, such as those based on cereals and other starch rich crops, sugars and oil crops, to the Renewable Energy Directive targets to current consumption levels, without foreseeing any limits on their overall consumption. The Commission is proposing to limit to the current level of consumption, i.e. 5%, the volume of biofuels and bioliquids produced from crops used for food and feed that can be included in the EU’s 10% target for renewable energy target for 2020 for the transport sector, while maintaining the overall renewable energy and carbon intensity reduction targets. 2. An increase to 60% of the minimum greenhouse gas saving threshold for biofuels and bioliquids produced in new installations, with effect from 1st July 201,4 in order to improve the EU’s overall greenhouse gas balance, as well as discouraging further investments in installations with low greenhouse gas savings performance. 3. The introduction of the reporting of estimated emissions from carbon stock changes caused by indirect land-use change, based on the best available scientific evidence, for the purposes of the calculation of the life cycle greenhouse gas emission savings from biofuels and bioliquids, in the reports required to be provided by fuel suppliers and the Member States on greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels and bioliquids. 4. A strengthened incentive mechanism to further promote sustainable and advanced biofuels from feedstocks that do not create an additional demand for land. 5. The simplification of the calculation of greenhouse gas savings for European biofuel producers, levelling the playing field between EU producers and producers in third countries. The proposal also seeks to protect existing investments until 2020. The Commission is of the view that, in the period after 2020, biofuels which do not lead to substantial greenhouse gas savings (when emissions from indirect land-use change are included) and are produced from crops used for food and feed should not be subsidised. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to permit adaptation to technical and scientific progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be delegated to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Convention of the International Maritime Organisation on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (the 'IMO' and 'the STCW-F Convention' respectively), was adopted on 7 July 1995 at the International Conference convened by the IMO in London at which delegations of 22 attending Member States voted in favour of its adoption. The objective of the STCW-F Convention is to ensure that personnel on board fishing vessels are qualified (as proven by an official certificate) and fit for the job (following medical examination), so that potential threats to safety of life and/or property at sea or to the marine environment are minimised during operations on board sea-going vessels, bearing in mind that fishing at sea is one of the most hazardous professions. Another aim of the Convention is to achieve and maintain a level playing field in the fisheries sector by fostering vocational education. Pursuant to the right of freedom of movement of workers, in matters of professional qualifications, Directive 2005/36/EC sets clear rules on mutual recognition between Member States under the so-called ""general system of recognition"". The Directive applies to EU nationals wishing to pursue a profession in another Member State where this profession is regulated, except where, for a given profession and in accordance of the principle of lex specialis, other specific rules directly related to the recognition of professional qualifications are laid down by a separate piece of legislation under EU law. The STCW-F Convention does not lay down a system of recognition of professional qualifications similar to the one established by Directive 2005/36/EC. On the contrary, the STCW-F Convention does not admit the use of certificates issued by States that are not party to the Convention. However, Member States are under the obligation to comply with EU law, namely to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/36/EC. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice on external competence, the Member States are not allowed to ratify the STCW-F Convention without European Union authorisation as the provisions concerning the recognition of regulated professions pursed by EU nationals on board fishing vessels affect the exercise of the European Union's exclusive competence in this area. As regards those Member States that have already ratified the Convention before the entry into force of the proposed Decision, they are required to deposit with the IMO Secretary-General a statement whereby they acknowledge that EU law shall prevail in case of conflict in relations between Member States. Against this background, it is now appropriate, in the interest of the Common Fisheries Policy, to authorise the Member States to sign and/or ratify the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995, of the International Maritime Organisation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2), 46, 53(1) and 62 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Commission proposes that the Member States are authorised to sign and/or ratify the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995, of the International Maritime Organisation, adopted on 7 July 1995, for the parts falling under the European Union's competence. The authorisation to the Member States shall be granted on condition that they formulate a reservation when depositing their instrument of ratification to the effect that European Union law shall continue to be applied in their mutual relations. Those Member States that have already ratified the Convention, shall submit a statement to the Secretary-General of IMO whereby they state that Union law relating to recognition of professional qualifications applies in relations between Member States. The proposed Decision will therefore enable and encourage Member States to take all the necessary steps for ratification without further delay.

439EP7,"""""Animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals""""",0.825,0.842,0.895,0.516,0.333,0.916,0.821,0.771,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to extend, until the end of 2011, transitional measures on the non-commercial movement of pet animals. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, pet dogs, cats and ferrets travelling with their owner to another Member State must be accompanied by a passport, or when imported by a certificate, providing proof of a valid anti-rabies vaccination (“general regime”). As of 3 July 2011 electronic identification of dogs, cats and ferrets will be mandatory. In order to take account of the particular situation of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom with regard to rabies, Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides for a transitional period during which the entry of pet dogs and cats into those Member States is subjected to more stringent requirements. The Regulation grants a period of five years starting from the date of its entry into force, i.e. until 3 July 2008 (extended to 30 June 2010), to Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom to make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with certain additional requirements to prevent the risk of introducing rabies, echinococcus and ticks (""transitional regime""). In order to determine the regime to be applied with effect from 1 July 2010, the Commission carried out an impact assessment based on various recent consultations and on the report that was adopted on 8 October 2007 that took into account the recommendations made by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA identified that in 2005 certain Member States had a non negligible prevalence of rabies in their pet population, which is related to the rabies situation in wildlife (foxes are the main reservoir of rabies in Europe). In view of the EFSA opinions and of the Community-supported programmes, the transitional measure provided for in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should be extended until 31 December 2011. Moreover, from the opinions adopted by EFSA with regard to echinococcosis and ticks, it results that the data available did not allow EFSA to demonstrate a particular status of the five Member States applying the transitional regime with regard to certain ticks and the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis and to quantify the risk of pathogen introduction through the non-commercial movement of pet animals. For reasons of consistency, it is appropriate to extend the transitional measure provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 until 31 December 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers four policy options: Option 1 : no action - this option means that after 30 June 2010, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the UK will no longer make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to additional requirements regarding rabies, echinococcus and ticks. Option 2 : extension of the transitional regime – this option means a further temporary extension of the transitional period until the end of 2011. This option would require a Commission proposal to the European Parliament and the Council extending the transitional period for the five Member States that currently apply special rules and clarifying the regime that would apply as from 1 January 2012. Option 3 : adjustment of the current rules applicable to all Member States. Option 4 : continuation of the transitional regime on a permanent basis. Following on from the impact assessment, preference has been given to options 1 and 2, which are similar in principle. Either would entail removing, sooner or later, the unjustified disparities, discrimination and burden felt by citizens including citizens from the five Member States who are affected by additional requirements when returning from abroad. At the same time, both options would maintain a high level of safety for pet movements within and into the EU, by applying the general regime, which has proved to be effective in preventing human and pet animal cases of rabies caused by lawful movement of pets between and into Member States. However, the Commission concludes that there is a slight advantage in selecting option 2 as it lowers the public health risk. CONTENT: the overall objectives of this Regulation are to be seen in the light of the free circulation of people and the new Animal Health Strategy. The specific objectives are: to harmonise requirements to remove disproportionate obstacles to the movement of pets for non-commercial purposes across the EU or entering the EU from third countries, while properly protecting public and animal health , in particular with regard to rabies; to provide EU rules that are proportionate, avoid causing difficulties and give clear benefits in terms of clarity and simplification for travelling pet owners. The proposal foresees that special science based rules could be adopted by the Commission under the comitology procedure if a Member State demonstrates that they are necessary to effectively protect itself against the introduction and spread of disease agents that do not occur in their territory. Lastly, two new Annexes, Annex Ia and Annex Ib, the texts of which are set out in the Annex to the present Regulation, shall be inserted. Part C of Annex I, Annex Ib and parts B and C of Annex II may be amended by the Commission to take account of developments in the situation within Community territory or in third countries as regards diseases affecting the species of animals covered by this Regulation, in particular rabies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. To ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link, it would be beneficial to retain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single safety authority responsible for the whole of this infrastructure. To this end, it is necessary to adapt Directive (EU) 2016/798. In a parallel and related initiative, the Commission also proposes the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and Council empowering France to negotiate and conclude under certain conditions an international agreement that would maintain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single national safety authority for the Channel Fixed Link. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Article 3(7) of Directive (EU) 2016/798, which defines the concept of ‘national safety authority’ for the purposes of both railway safety under that Directive and railway interoperability under Directive (EU) 2016/797. Specifically, the proposal shall: - allow a body entrusted by a Member State and a third country with the tasks regarding railway safety and interoperability on the basis of an international agreement concluded or authorised by the EU to be considered as a national safety authority under Union law; - provide that, where necessary for reasons of railway safety, the Member State concerned should make use without delay of the right afforded by the agreement with the third country concerned, whereby the national safety authority is entitled to assume sole competence over the part of the rail infrastructure situated in that Member State; - provide that the European Court of Justice would have jurisdiction to give a ruling at the request of an arbitration tribunal set up by an international agreement such as the one that France should be empowered to negotiate and conclude with the United Kingdom."
6523EP7,"""""Statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts""""",0.684,0.802,0.018,0.29,0.182,0.771,0.005,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to enhance the internal market for statutory audits to allow small and medium-sized firms to grow and encourage the entry of new players. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUD: in a crisis where EUR 4 588.9 billion of taxpayer money was committed to support banks between October 2008 and October 2009 and where such aid accounted for 39% of EU 27 GDP in 2009, all components of the financial system need to be improved. Robust audit is key to re-establishing trust and market confidence. It contributes to investor protection by providing easily accessible, cost-effective and trustworthy information about the financial statements of companies. It also potentially reduces the cost of capital for audited companies by ensuring more transparency and reliability of financial statements. It is also important to stress that auditors are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits. EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit through Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts. However, the high degree of concentration in audit market and the multitude of approval procedures necessary to provide cross-border statutory audits prevent small and medium-sized audit firms from benefiting from the internal market. The following problems are examined: §  a high level of administrative burden resulting from fragmented national regulation; §  the provision of cross-border statutory audits is allowed only if an auditor passes an aptitude test and gets approved and registered in every Member State; §  a lack of common standards across the EU on audit practice, independence, internal control of audit firms; §  auditing standards do not take into account the size of the audited companies, in particular of SMEs; §  associated problems regarding supervision of non-PIEs. This proposal on amending Directive 2006/43/EC aims to improve the internal market on statutory audits. It will coexist with a proposal for a regulation on the specific requirements on the statutory audit of public-interest entities. The two proposals are part of the ongoing regulatory reform in various domains of the financial sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment concluded that the best options to improve the existing situation would be: §  facilitation of the cross-border recognition of audit providers' competence; §  streamlining of the standards on audit practice, independence and internal control of audit firms across the Union; §  adaptation of audit standards to the size of the audited entity by requesting Member States to ensure that a proportionate and simplified audit for SMEs is possible. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal contains amendments to the provisions on the approval and registration of auditors and audit firms, on the existing principles in Directive 2006/43/EC regarding professional ethics, professional secrecy, independence and reporting as well as the associated supervision rules that remain applicable for the audit of non-public-interest entities (non- PIEs). The main modifications to the Directive are: Articulation between the Directive and an additional legal instrument on specific requirements for the statutory audit of PIEs : the proposal deals with the applicability of the amended Directive to the statutory audit of PIEs. Certain provisions apply to statutory auditors and audit firms, irrespective of the type of audited entity. However, for the rest of the Articles of the Directive, the situation is different: clauses on independence and objectivity, audit fees, audit reporting, quality assurance, investigations and penalties would not apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. On these specific issues more detailed rules would be enacted in the Regulation. Definition of ""statutory audit"" in order to take account of the new Accountancy Directive : the new definition will continue to cover the instances where different Union legal texts impose an obligation on some undertakings to have their financial statements audited, depending on their legal form or on their activity. In order to guarantee the “unicity” of audit, the definition of ""statutory audit"" should also cover situations where Member States decide to impose an obligation on small undertakings to have their financial statements audited. Lastly, where a small undertaking decides voluntarily to have its financial statements audited, such audit should also be considered a statutory audit. Modification of the ownership rules : currently, the Directive requires that a majority of the voting rights in an audit firm is held by licensed accountant practitioners. This requirement is no longer stipulated in the proposed amendment and Member States are forbidden to require that a minimum of capital or of voting rights in an audit firm is held by statutory auditors or audit firms. However, the proposal maintains the existing requirement that a majority of the members of the administrative or management body of the audit firm are audit firms or statutory auditors. Passport for audit firms : the proposal for an amended Directive would allow audit firms to provide statutory audits in Member States other than the Member State in which they have been approved, provided that the key audit partner leading the audit is approved as an auditor in the Member State concerned. However, once approval is obtained in the home Member State, the host Member State may require some form of registration of audit firms from other Member States. Passport for statutory auditors and ""softening"" the conditions for a statutory auditor to be approved in a different Member State : the proposed modifications regarding the approval of statutory auditors from other Member States are aligned with the provisions of the Directive 2005/36 on the recognition of professional qualifications. §  The proposal would allow statutory auditors to provide cross-border statutory audit services on a temporary or occasional basis. The conditions set out in the Professional Qualifications Directive would apply, notably the obligation to communicate the intention to provide the services in question to the relevant competent authority. §  A Member State will be able to offer the statutory auditor who is approved in another Member State the choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test, if such auditor wants to set up a permanent establishment in that Member State. The test should be aimed at assessing the statutory auditor's knowledge of the laws and regulations of that Member State that are relevant for the carrying out of the statutory audit. §  During the adaptation period, which should be offered to the applicant as an alternative to the aptitude test, the statutory auditor would be allowed to conduct statutory audit in the Member State, other than the one in which he or she is approved, under the supervision of a local auditor. The length of the adaptation period is three years. Requirements to competent authorities to cooperate regarding educational requirements and aptitude test : in order to ensure more convergence of the educational qualifications of auditors at Union level, the competent national authorities in charge of the public oversight for statutory auditors must cooperate. Cooperation at Union level is also necessary to harmonise the requirements of the aptitude test. Auditing standards and audit reporting : the proposal requires Member States to ensure that statutory auditors and audit firms carry out audits in accordance with the international auditing standards. New rules regarding competent authorities : currently, the Directive requires Member States to organise a system of public oversight for statutory auditors and audit firms. The new amendment states that the competent authority responsible for public oversight will be a public authority that will be also responsible for approval, registration and quality assurance. The competent authority responsible for the public oversight may delegate some of its tasks to other authorities or bodies with regard to the approval and registration of the statutory auditors and audit firms. Such delegation must be subject to several conditions and the body that bears the ultimate responsibility is the competent authority. Prohibition of contractual clauses: the proposal prohibits clauses according to which a third party suggests, recommends or requires the audited entity to appoint a specific statutory auditor or audit firm. Special rules for the statutory audit of small and medium-sized undertakings : following the recent Commission proposal, small undertakings would no longer be required by EU law to have their financial statements audited, although Member States may still require it. However, the requirement will continue to apply to medium-sized undertakings. When medium-sized undertakings are audited pursuant to EU law, the amended Directive requires Member States to ensure that the way in which the auditing standards are applied are adapted to the dimension and scale of those undertakings. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the European Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
4000EP7,"""""Access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms""""",0.105,0.934,0.947,0.581,0.364,0.892,0.897,0.4,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to ensure the proper functioning of the banking sector and to restore confidence in it. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/EC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions have been substantially modified several times. Many of the provisions of these two directives are applicable both to credit institutions and investment firms. To ensure the consistent application of these measures, it is appropriate to merge them in order to create new legislation applicable to both types of entity. This new legislation will comprise two different legal instruments. In this proposal for a Directive, are the provisions concerning the authorisation of credit institutions and the exercise of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services. The accompanying proposal for a Regulation establishes uniform and directly applicable prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms. This new elements in this proposal comprise provisions on sanctions, effective corporate governance and provisions preventing the over-reliance on external credit ratings. Sanctions : the sanctions applicable for key violations of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), such as authorisation requirements, prudential obligations and reporting obligations, vary across Member States and do not seem always appropriate to ensure sanctions are sufficiently effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Furthermore, there is a certain divergence in the level of application of sanctions in different Member States. In its 2010 Communication ""Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial sector"", the Commission has envisaged EU legislative action to set minimum common standards on certain key issues of sanctioning regimes, to be adapted to the specifics of the different sectors. Corporate governance : strengthening corporate governance is a priority for the Commission, especially in the context of its financial markets reform and crisis prevention programme. The public consultation launched as a result of its Green Paper on corporate governance in financial institutions and remuneration policies demonstrated a broad consensus on the deficiencies of corporate governance standards and practices in the financial services sector. In a resolution, adopted in July 2010, the European Parliament also recognised the importance of strengthening corporate governance standards and practices in financial institutions. Over-reliance on external ratings : overreliance on credit ratings may lead to herding behaviour of financial actors, e.g. parallel selling-off of debt instruments after that instrument has been downgraded below investment grade, which may affect financial stability. At the international level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recently issued principles to reduce authorities’ and financial institutions’ reliance on external ratings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a series of options was analysed to define the legal framework for sanctioning regimes and corporate governance: the options on sanctioning regimes are expected to facilitate detection of violations and to empower competent authorities to apply appropriate sanctions. This is expected to ensure better enforcement of the CRD obligations by credit institutions, which would benefit all stakeholders; the preferred policy options improving corporate governance will help avoid excessive risk-taking by credit institutions and lower the risk of failure. It would contribute to the resilience of the banking sector and improve investor confidence The impact on credit institutions and all stakeholders (depositors, shareholders, creditors) should be positive; as regards over-reliance on external ratings, the impact assessment of the new initiative on credit rating agencies (planned for early July 2011) will; include a general chapter on over-reliance covered by these proposals. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC with regard to the coordination of national provisions governing the authorisation of the business, the acquisition of qualifying holdings, the exercise of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services, the powers of supervisory authorities of home and host Member States in this regard and the provisions governing the initial capital and the supervisory review of credit institutions and investment firms. Its main objective is to coordinate national provisions concerning the access to the activity of credit institutions and investment firms, the modalities for their governance, and their supervisory framework. The proposal seeks to ensure the smooth operation of the banking sector and restoring confidence in it by: introducing an effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctioning regime to ensure compliance with the CRD rules; development of a level playing field which minimises the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage; effective supervision of banking service providers; effective corporate governance within credit institutions which should contribute to avoid excessive risk taking. The main features of the proposal are as follows: 1) Sanctions : with a view to reinforcing and approximating the legal framework concerning sanctions and the mechanisms facilitating detection of breaches, the Directive will require Member States to comply with the following minimum rules: make provision for administrative sanctions and measures that are applicable to natural and legal persons responsible for violations, which would include credit institutions, investment companies and individuals, where appropriate; in case of a breach, a minimum set of administrative sanctions and measures should be available to competent authorities. This includes withdrawal of authorisation, cease and desist orders, public statement, dismissal of management, administrative pecuniary sanctions; the maximum level of administrative pecuniary sanctions laid down in national legislation should exceed the benefits derived from the violation if they can be determined; sanctions and measures applied should be published. Lastly, appropriate mechanism should be put in place to encourage reporting of breaches within credit institutions and investment firms. 2) Corporate governance: with a view to reinforcing the legislative framework regarding corporate governance, the proposal provides for: i) improving the effectiveness of management bodies to oversee risks; ii) improve the stature of the risk management function; and iii) ensure the effective follow-up of risk management by the supervisory authorities. The management body of a credit institution or investment firm as a whole should commit sufficient time and possess adequate knowledge, skills and experience to be able to understand the business of the credit institution and its main risk exposures. All members of the management body should be of sufficiently good repute and possess individual qualities and independence of mind which enable them to constructively challenge and oversee the decisions of the management. To avoid group think and facilitate critical challenge, management boards of credit institutions should be sufficiently diverse as regards age, gender, geographical provenance, educational and professional background. The management body should be responsible and accountable for the overall risk strategy of the credit institution or investment firm and for the adequacy of the risk management systems, taking into account the credit institution's risk profile. Credit institutions and investment firms should have an independent risk management function. 3) Over-reliance on external ratings : overall, the directive seeks to encourage banks to rely on internal ratings rather than external ones to calculate their regulatory capital requirements. In addition, it is proposed that EBA publicly discloses, on an annual basis, information on the steps taken by institutions and by supervisory authorities to reduce over-reliance on external ratings and reports on the degree of supervisory convergence in this regard. 4) Capital buffers: on the basis of Basel III, this proposal introduces two capital buffers on top of the requirements: a Capital Conservation Buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer. the Capital Conservation Buffer amounts to 2,5% of risk weighted assets, applies at all times and has to be met with capital of highest quality. It is aimed at ensuring institutions' capacity to absorb losses in stressed periods that may span a number of years; the Countercyclical Capital Buffer is set by national authorities for loans provided to natural and legal persons within their Member State. It can be set between 0% and 2.5% of risk weighted assets and has to be met by capital of highest quality likewise. If justified, authorities can even set a buffer beyond 2.5%. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer will be required during periods of excessive credit growth and released in a downturn. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the Union’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions conferring on the Commission the right to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
6826EP9,"""""Fisheries control""""",0.113,0.852,0.027,0.014,0.421,0.787,0.786,0.146,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to revise the fisheries control system. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: an effective control system is essential to ensure that EU fisheries are managed in a sustainable manner, which in turn ensures the long-term viability of the EU fisheries sector and protects the livelihoods of EU fishermen. The measures establishing a Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) for ensuring compliance with rules of the CFP are provided for in four different legal acts: 1) the Fisheries Control Regulation; 2) the Regulation establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA); 3) the Regulation establishing a system to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU Regulation); and 4) the Regulation on the sustainable management of the external fishing fleets (SMEF). With the exception of the SMEF regulation, which was recently revised, the current Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) was designed prior to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and as such it is not fully coherent with it. In addition, the system reflects control strategies, methodologies and challenges of more than 10 years ago, and it is not equipped to effectively address current and future needs in terms of fisheries data and fleet control, to match the constant evolution of fishing practices and techniques and to take advantage of modern and more cost-effective control technologies and data exchange systems. The current system also does not reflect new and modern Union policies recently adopted, such as the plastic strategy, the digital single market strategy, and the international ocean governance. Several discussions and exchanges of view have taken place in the Council, in the Parliament, in the Administrative Board of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with Member States and with stakeholders since the publication of all these documents. Those discussions confirmed that there is unanimous agreement among the European Institutions and among direct stakeholders that the Fisheries Control System is not effective and efficient and that, as such, it is not entirely fit for purpose to sustain the achievements of the CFP objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option selected is targeted changes to the fisheries control system (in particular regulations on fisheries control, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the European Fisheries Control Agency). Positive environmental impacts of the preferred option would encompass: reduction of overfishing, elimination of discards at sea, healthier fish stocks and proper control of marine protected areas. Main socio-economic benefits include: increased wages and competitiveness of fishing industry, especially for the small fleet; promotion of job creation (especially in ICT); improved compliance with the CFP and equal treatment of fishers. CONTENT: the specific objectives of the proposed revision of the fisheries control regime are to: bridge the gaps with the CFP and with other EU policies; simplify the legislative framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burden; improve availability, reliability and completeness of fisheries data and information, in particular of catch data, and allow exchange and sharing of information; remove obstacles that hinder the development of a culture of compliance and the equitable treatment of operators within and across Member States. The proposal contains, inter alia, the following measures: clarification of the inspection process , inspectors' duties, and masters' and operators' duties during inspections. Digitisation of inspection reports through the mandatory use of an Electronic Inspection Report System which will allow a better use and exchange of data between relevant authorities and Member States; a new list of infringements of the CFP rules, which should be qualified as serious by nature, new detailed and exhaustive list of criteria to qualify as serious certain other infringements of the CFP rules; a more reliable and complete fisheries data system providing for the full digitisation of transhipment and landing declarations, applicable to all EU fishing vessels (including those less than 12 metres in length), an electronic traceability system for all vessels, new weighing procedures for fishery products and strengthened rules for recording recreational catches; better traceability of EU and imported fishery and aquaculture products : traceability information is clarified so that it allows linking a specific lot of fishery products to a particular landing by an EU fishing vessel. Information is recorded electronically so that controls in the supply chain within the internal market are more effective and efficient; the use of remote electronic monitoring tools , in particular CCTVs, for the control of the landing obligation. Certain vessels with active fishing gears shall be fitted with a device that monitors and records engine power; improving the reporting of lost fishing gear through the use of (electronic) logbooks for all categories of vessels, the deletion of the current derogation for vessels under 12 metres to take on board the equipment necessary to recover lost gear and laying down conditions to establish EU provisions for the marking and control of fishing gear for recreational fisheries; the revision of the mandate of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to fully align its objectives with the Common Fisheries Policy and extend its inspection powers."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in view of the Plan of Implementation adopted at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, the European Community is committed inter alia to maintaining or restoring stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield with the aim of achieving these goals for depleted stocks on an urgent basis and where possible not later than 2015. Moreover, during the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the Commission and Council agreed to implement multi-annual plans and recovery plans concerning fisheries resources of interest to the Community. The Western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel is by far the most important of the three horse mackerel stocks which inhabit the Community's continental shelf. The current management system does not serve the horse mackerel situation very well. The biological information on this stock is not sufficient for a full stock assessment that would allow setting a fishing mortality target related to maximum sustainable yield and relate total allowable catches to scientific catch predictions. However, the index of egg abundance which is being calculated since 1977 in triennial international surveys can be used as a biological indicator for the development of the stock size. Advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) indicates that a harvest control rule based on the trend in egg abundance from the last three egg surveys would provide for sustainable stock management. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered three options: Option 1 : no policy change: continue fixing the fishing possibilities as a yearly ad hoc exercise based on annual scientific advice and political considerations; Option 2 : freezing or gradually reducing fishing pressure in view of the insufficient knowledge about the biological status of the stock; Option 3: management plan . The impact assessment concludes that the most suitable option is the one that consists of proposing a long-term management plan, which sets TACs stable for three years according to a harvest control rule based on a precautionary advice for the harvest level adjusted by a trend that reflects the tri-annual results of egg surveys. CONTENT: the plan's objective is to maintain the biomass of western horse mackerel at a level that ensures its sustainable exploitation, and to provide the highest long-term yield. To this end, the harvest control rule should be based in equal parts on precautionary advice given for average recruitment conditions, and on recent total allowable catches adjusted by a factor that reflects the recent trend in the stock abundance as measured through egg production. The proposal includes a provision for evaluation of management measures each sixth year from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. In view of the revision clause built into the plan, the harvest rule could be adapted to more precise scientific assessments once these are available. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."
5989EP7,"""""European Union Agency for Railways""""",0.439,0.886,0.93,0.452,0.212,0.916,0.836,0.486,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to replace the original founding Regulation of the European Railway Agency, and add new important tasks to the Agency making it a truly European Railway Authority in the field of interoperability and safety (fourth railway package). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the last decade, the EU railway market has witnessed profound changes, gradually introduced by three legislative ‘railway packages’ intended to open up the national markets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level, while maintaining high level of safety. However, the modal share of rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. This is why the Commission has put forward the Fourth Railway Package in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing the remaining market obstacles. This proposal for a Regulation, along with the proposal to recast Directive 2004/49/EC on rail safety and the proposal to recast Directive 2008/57/EC (interoperability) are part of this fourth package which focuses on the removal of remaining administrative and technical barriers by: establishing a common approach to safety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway undertakings active across the EU; decreasing administrative costs, accelerating administrative procedures, as well as avoiding disguised discrimination, relying on the European Railways Agency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the baseline scenario (Option 1), the Commission identified five options: Option 2: greater coordination role for the Agency in ensuring a consistent approach to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation; Option 3: European Railways Agency (ERA) as a one-stop-shop, where the final decision on certification and authorisation remains with the national safety agencies (NSAs) but ERA performs entry and exit checks of applications and of the decisions; Option 4: ERA and NSAs share competencies, where the final decision on certification and authorisation is taken by the Agency; Option 5: ERA takes over activities of NSAs in relation to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation; Option 6: horizontal measures that could be implemented to improve the competitiveness of the rail sector. The environmental impact of all the options was assessed as positive, though low. The social impact of all the options was assessed as low/marginal. It was concluded that Option 4 (combined with Option 6) was the preferred option as it provides the best balance of outcomes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation seeks to add new tasks to the European Railway Agency making it a truly European Railway Authority in the field of interoperability and safety. The Agency should in particular: play the role of European authority responsible for issuing authorisations for placing on the market for railway vehicles and for types of vehicles, safety certificates for railway undertakings and authorisations for placing in service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems; monitor national railway rules and the performance of national authorities acting in the railway interoperability and safety fields; provide independent and objective technical support, predominantly to the Commission; have a strengthened role in the field of telematics applications to ensure their consistent development and swift deployment; be given a more important role to ensure the consistent development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). The proposal also provides for the establishment of an appeal mechanism so that decisions of the Executive Director can be subject to appeal to a specialised Board of Appeal, whose decisions are, in turn, open to action before the Court of Justice. Lastly, in order to perform its tasks properly, the Agency should have legal personality and an autonomous budget funded mainly through a contribution by the Union and through fees and charges paid by applicants. It should be noted that the fourth railway package also includes: (i) a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and (ii) a proposal amending Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the new proposal for a Regulation constitutes a legislative basis for commitments in terms of budget and staff for the Agency. The implication for expenditure is estimated at EUR 161.118 million for the period 2015-2020. These figures are provisional because they depend on the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020 by the budgetary authority. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
5318EP7,"""""Timing of auctions of greenhouse gas allowances""""",0.07,0.293,0.912,0.097,0.242,0.759,0.8,0.543,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 2003/87/EC clarifying provisions on the timing of auctions of greenhouse gas allowances. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC does not specify how volumes of greenhouse gas emission allowances to be auctioned are to be distributed over the trading period. One of the features of the change from the phase 2 (period from 2008 to 2012) into phase 3 (period from 2013 to 2020) and the implementation provisions adopted so far is that the supply of allowances and international credits is expected to temporarily increase significantly in the short term. This exacerbates the already significant, unforeseen impact of the macro-economic developments, due to which emissions have decreased considerably and are not expected to increase significantly in 2012 and 2013. This combination of increased net supply and reduced demand increasingly affects the orderly functioning of the European carbon market in the transition to phase 3. In the light of such exceptional circumstances, the Commission is currently reviewing the need for a further change of the auctioning timetable and will invite experts in the Climate Change Committee to consider a draft for a future amendment to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 and indicate their view on the appropriate action to be taken before the end of this year. The Commission also invites any other interested stakeholders to express their views on this draft and will actively engage with them in this regard. Meanwhile, the legislative process to clarify the scope of the Commission's powers by means of the present proposal should proceed swiftly and independently of the result of consultations with the Climate Change Committee. Finally, the Commission reaffirms its commitment, as stated in the context of the agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive, to urgently examine and present options for action with a view to adopting further appropriate structural measures to strengthen the ETS during phase 3, and make it more effective. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: for the purposes of legal certainty, it should be clarified that, in order to ensure an orderly functioning of the market, the Commission is able to adapt the auction timetable laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. The proposed amendment would expressly provide such clarification in the relevant provision of the EU ETS Directive. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this measure does not have any impact on the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the dynamically growing Southeast Asian economies, with their over 600 million consumers and a rapidly rising middle class, are key markets for European Union exporters and investors. With a total EUR 208 billion of trade in goods and EUR 77 billion of trade in services (2016), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) taken as a whole is the EU’s third largest trading partner outside Europe, after the US and China. At the same time, a total EUR 263 billion foreign direct investment stock (2016) in the ASEAN makes the EU the first foreign direct investor in the ASEAN, while the ASEAN as a whole is in its turn the second largest Asian foreign direct investor in the EU – with a total foreign direct investment stock of EUR 116 billion (2016). Within the ASEAN, Singapore is by far the EU’s largest partner, accounting for slightly under one-third of EU-ASEAN trade in goods and services, and roughly two-thirds of investments between the two regions. Over 10 000 EU companies are established in Singapore and use it as a hub to serve the whole Pacific Rim. On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Member States of the ASEAN. On 12 September 2011, the Council authorised the Commission to extend the on-going negotiations with Singapore to cover also investment protection, based on a new EU competence under the Lisbon Treaty. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in 2011 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Singapore an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. From the date of its entry into force, the EU-Singapore IPA will replace and supersede the bilateral investment treaties between the Republic of Singapore and EU Member States that are listed in the IPA. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Singapore of the other part. Main aim of the IPA: it aims to: In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured the following: Committee: the institutional chapter of the IPA establishes a committee with the main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement. Among other tasks, the committee may, subject to the completion of each side’s respective legal requirements and procedures, decide to appoint the Members of the ICS Tribunals, fix their monthly retainer and fees, and adopt binding interpretations of the agreement. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU-Singapore FTA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It is estimated that foregone duties could reach an amount of EUR 248.8 million upon full implementation of the agreement. The estimate is based on average imports projected for 2025 in the absence of an agreement and represents the annual loss in revenues resulting from the elimination of EU tariffs on imports from Singapore. The EU-Singapore IPA is expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures. The agreement will be the EU’s second (after the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to incorporate the Investment Court System (ICS) for the resolution of disputes between investors and states. An amount of EUR 200 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2018 onwards (subject to the entry into force of the agreement) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers it necessary to make certain amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (Rural Development Regulation) to ensure policy continuity in the final years of the programming period and to ensure a smooth transition to the next programming period. In relation to direct payments, some of the provisions in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 (Direct Payment Regulation) do not cover calendar year 2020 since expenditure relating to calendar year 2020 is made in financial year 2021, which is the first year of the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. Those Member States would be faced with important changes in their direct payments and rural development envelopes with considerable effects on the payments to farmers under both pillars. CONTENT: this proposal aims to ensure the continuity of support to European farmers in the years 2019 and 2020 by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 and direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. As regards support for rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (EAFRD), the proposal relates to financial years 2019 – 2021, whereas the proposed modifications for direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 relate to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. Rural development : the proposal makes it possible for the Member States to modify the degressivity schedule for payments to areas, which had received such payments in the previous programming period, while in the ongoing period, not being classified anymore as areas facing natural constraints other than mountain areas pursuant to the Rural Development Regulation. This modification would allow calculating transitional payments for the years 2019 and 2020 based on payment levels of the 2014-2020 period. The proposal extends the use of the technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to actions related to the preparation of the future CAP. The proposal concerns exclusively the scope of technical assistance without modifying the financial support. Flexibility between pillars in year 2020 and transfer of the product of reduction of direct payments to Rural development : flexibility between pillars is an optional transfer of funds between direct payments and rural development. The proposal includes provisions regarding the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between pillars in calendar year 2020 (corresponding to financial year 2021). It calls for a transfer between pillars to remain possible in calendar year 2020 under the same conditions as currently standing and that the estimated product of reduction continues to be transferred from direct payments to rural development. In order to promptly provide the necessary flexibility to the Member States and to ensure the continuity of the rural development policy in the final years of the 20142020 programming period, this Regulation should apply from 1 March 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any financial implications in terms of increased expenditure. The effect of the proposed provisions giving Member States an option to transfer amounts between direct payments allocations in calendar year 2020/financial year 2021 and EAFRD in financial year 2021 as well as the transfer of the estimated product of reduction from direct payments in calendar year 2020 to EAFRD in financial year 2021 will depend on Member States’ implementation and can therefore not be quantified at present. Such transfers will in any case remain neutral with regard to overall commitment appropriations in the way that any deductions from the direct payments allocations will be off-set by a corresponding increase in the EAFRD allocations and vice versa."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the digital single market strategy established a robust framework which must now be matched with an equally ambitious investment programme to increase the EU's international competitiveness, as well as to develop and strengthen Europe's strategic digital capacities. European Heads of State and Government identified the main pillars of a strong digital economy: cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, a world class infrastructure that includes high performance computing, digital skills, and the digital transformation of the public sector. In its resolution of 1 June 2017 on the digitising European industry, the European Parliament highlighted the importance of a common European cybersecurity approach, recognising the need to raise awareness and considered cyber-resilience as a crucial responsibility for business leaders and national and European industrial security policymakers. The digital Europe programme is a central element of the Commission's comprehensive response to the challenge of digital transformation, part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) proposal for 2021-2027. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the digital Europe programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021 - 2027, the forms of European Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The overall objective of the proposed programme is to support the digital transformation of the European economy and society and bring its benefits to European citizens and businesses. It shall reinforce Europe's capacities in key digital technology areas through large-scale deployment and widen their diffusion and uptake in areas of public interest and the private sector. The programme has five specific objectives: 1. high-performance computing : funding aims to build-up and strengthen the EU's high performance computing (HPC) and data processing capacities, and ensure their wide use both in areas of public interest such as health, environment and security, and by industry, notably SMEs. At EU level, in March 2017, 29 countries engaged to cooperate on connected mobility, and 16 Member States have committed so far to work together and with the Commission to acquire and deploy an integrated world-class high performance computing infrastructure. In January 2018, the Commission proposed a Council Regulation to establish the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking ‘EuroHPC’. The continuation of the Joint Undertaking is deemed to be the most effective instrument to implement the objectives of the EuroHPC initiative, in particular to coordinate national and European Union strategies and investments in high performance computing infrastructure and R&D; 2. cybersecurity : the programme shall contribute to the protection of the EU digital economy, society and democracies by promoting the EU cyber defence and cyber security industry, financing advanced cyber security equipment and infrastructure, and supporting the development of the necessary skills and knowledge. 3. artificial intelligence : the aim is to build-up and reinforce core artificial intelligence (AI) capacities such as a data resources and libraries of artificial intelligence algorithms and make them accessible to all businesses and public administrations, as well as reinforce and foster links between existing artificial intelligence testing and experimentation facilities in Member States; 4. advanced digital skills : the programme shall ensure that the current and future labour force can easily acquire advanced digital skills, notably in high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, by offering students, graduates, and existing workers the means to acquire and develop these skills, no matter where they are situated; 5. deployment, better use of digital capacities and interoperability : the objective is to expand the best use of digital capacities, notably high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, across the economy, in areas of public interest and society, including the deployment of interoperable solutions in areas of public interest and facilitate access to technology and knowhow for all businesses, notably SMEs. Digital innovation hubs : the proposal foresees a central role for digital innovation hubs in the implementation of the programme. A network of digital innovation hubs shall ensure the widest geographical coverage across Europe. The digital innovation hubs shall serve as access points to the latest digital capacities, including high performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, as well as other innovative technologies such as key enabling technologies, also available also in fablabs or citylabs. They shall act as single-entry points in accessing tested and validated technologies and promote open innovation. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the programme is set at EUR 9.2 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, its indicative distribution shall be as follows: high performance computing: up to EUR 2.7 billion; cybersecurity: up to EUR 2.5 billion; artificial intelligence: up to EUR 2 billion; advanced digital skills: up to EUR 700 million; digital capacity utilisation and interoperability: up to EUR 1.3 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner. To tackle climate change effectively and achieve the EU's long-term decarbonisation objectives to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, an important step was taken when the European Council agreed in October 2014 the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy. A centrepiece of the 2030 policy framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically below 1990 levels by 2030. To achieve this target cost-effectively, the sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) will have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 while non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions by 30% compared to 2005. The European Council confirmed that a well-functioning, reformed EU ETS with an instrument to stabilise the market would be the main European instrument to achieve this target. This proposal is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the Strategic Framework for the Energy Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment is largely based on the findings of the comprehensive impact assessment on the 2030 framework, focusing on certain ETS-specific methodological elements not already assessed. It includes (i) addressing the potential risk of carbon leakage, (ii) the establishment of a Modernisation and an Innovation Fund, (iii) optional free allocation to modernise the electricity sector in lower income Member States, as well as (iv) aspects building on the lessons learnt since 2013, such as the validity of emission allowances, guaranteeing a robust and secure registry and the continuation of the optional exclusion of small emitters. CONTENT : technological progress realised over time in the relevant sectors. Sectors deemed to be exposed to a risk of carbon leakage would continue to receive a higher allocation than others who have a higher ability to pass on relevant costs in product prices. maintains the Innovation Fund as a stepped-up effort to rapidly introduce new low-carbon technologies to the market enabling the EU to reach its long-term decarbonisation goals. Existing EU-level support for innovation is supplemented through dedicating 400 million allowances for these purposes. An extra 50 million allowances is added to this amount from the allowances that remain unused in 2013 to 2020 and would otherwise be placed in the Market Stability Reserve in 2020. establishes the Modernisation Fund and optional free allocation to the energy sector to contribute to the modernisation of the energy systems in lower income Member States. The Modernisation Fund is created with 2% of the overall quantity of allowances. These will be auctioned in accordance with the rules provided for in the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation to generate the necessary funds for projects to be carried out. The Commission also proposes that auction revenues should be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: EUR 14,639 million - DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for investigational medicinal products intended to be used in clinical trials in the Union. According to the Regulation, read in conjunction with the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol to the UK Withdrawal Agreement, the importation of investigational medicinal products from third countries into the Union or Northern Ireland is subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021), including for import requirements for investigational medicinal products, in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it is still proving very difficult for some operators currently based in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland to adapt as required by the Protocol. An interruption in the supply of investigational medicinal products would present a potential risk to the safety and well-being of participants in ongoing clinical trials and would hamper the establishment of new clinical trials in these Member States and Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 aims to provide for exemptions for medicinal products distributed in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta that are used as investigational medicinal products in clinical trials in those countries. Specifically, the proposal provides that the importation of investigational medicinal products from other parts of the United Kingdom into Northern Ireland and, until 31 December 2024, into Cyprus, Ireland and Malta is not subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation, provided that the following conditions are met: - the investigational medicinal products have undergone certification of batch release either in the Union or in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to verify compliance with the requirements set out in Article 63(1); - the investigational medicinal products are only made available to clinical trial participants in the Member State into which the investigational medicinal products are imported or, if imported into Northern Ireland, are only made available to clinical trial participants in Northern Ireland. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to introduce exemptions from certain obligations relating to medicinal products for human use available in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland, as well as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2016/680 (data protection law enforcement Directive) required the Commission to review, by 6 May 2019 at the latest, other legal acts adopted by the EU which regulate the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes, in order to assess the need to bring them into line with the Directive and to make, if appropriate, the necessary proposals to amend those acts to ensure a consistent approach to the protection of personal data under the Directive. The Commission set out the results of its review in a Communication of 24 June 2020 which identifies ten legal acts that should be aligned with the Directive and sets out a timetable for doing so. The list includes Council Framework Decision 2002/465/JHA on joint investigation teams. The Commission has indicated that it will present targeted amendments to this Decision in the last quarter of 2020; this is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: in the interests of consistency and effective protection of personal data, the Commission proposes that the processing of personal data carried out under Framework Decision 2002/465/JHA should comply with the rules set out in Directive (EU) 2016/680.

8178EP8,"""""Rail passengers' rights and obligations""""",0.571,0.715,0.98,0.604,0.192,0.821,0.848,0.577,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to update EU rules on rail passenger rights in order to better protect users in the event of delays, cancellations or discrimination. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007, which entered into force in December 2009, rail passengers have rights to information, reservations and tickets, assistance, care and compensation in the event of a delay or cancellation, free of charge assistance (for persons with disabilities), compensation in the event of an accident or quick access to a complaint handling system. In its 2013 report on the application of the Regulation, the Commission highlighted certain problematic areas which were confirmed by an impact assessment in 2016/2017. With this proposal to recast the existing legislation, the Commission wishes to better protect passengers no matter where they travel in the EU. It aligns rail with general aspects of passenger rights legislation on other transport modes, notably non-discrimination, contingency planning, disability training, complaint handling and enforcement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were broken down, in a sequential approach analysing and comparing costs and benefits and selecting a preferred policy scenario per theme: (i) exemptions; (ii) the applicability of the rights of persons with reduced mobility to all services; (iii) information for persons with reduced mobility; (iv) assistance to persons with reduced mobility; (v) handling of complaints and monitoring of enforcement by national enforcement agencies; (vi) definition of throughticket; (viii) force majeure; (ix) information for all travellers; (x) non-discrimination. CONTENT: the main elements of proposal recasting Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 are as follows: Uniform application of rules : to date, many Member States have frequently used national exemptions, which deprive travellers to a large extent of their rights. The proposal: removes exemptions for long-distance domestic services by 2020; removes exemptions for cross-border urban, suburban and regional services; requires that Member States grant exemptions only if they can prove that passengers are adequately protected on their territory. The Commission proposal updates the existing rules on rail passenger rights in five key areas: Information and non-discrimination : in order to improve provision of information about passenger rights at booking, the proposal: requires such information to be printed on the ticket or electronically. Notices informing passengers of their rights have to be placed in prominent positions in stations and on board; provides for passengers to be given fuller information on through tickets. Railway undertakings and ticket vendors have to make efforts to offer through tickets. They must prove that they informed passengers where their passenger rights do not apply to the whole journey but only to its segments; introduces a general clause prohibiting any form of discrimination, e.g. based on nationality, residence, location or currency of payment. Better rights for persons with disabilities or reduced mobility : mandatory right to assistance on all services and full compensation for loss or repair of mobility equipment. Relevant information has to be given in accessible formats and rail staff must receive disability awareness training. Enforcement, complaint-handling and sanctions : the proposal clarifies the procedure and deadlines for passengers to lodge complaints. It specifies the responsibilities of national enforcement bodies in cross-border cases and requires them to cooperate effectively. Force majeure : in 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the current Regulation does not allow for railway undertakings to be exempted from compensating passengers for delays caused by force majeure, thus creating a distinction between rail and other modes of transport. The proposal introduces a 'force majeure' clause which would exempt railway undertakings from paying compensation for delays only in very exceptional situations caused by severe weather conditions and natural disasters. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the EU on 17 July 1995, which came into force on 1 March 1998. Tunisia is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. In parallel to this political transition process, the Tunisian economy has suffered from continuous domestic unrest, regional instability (including the impact of the Libyan conflicts) and a weak international environment (particularly in the Union, Tunisia’s main trading partner). These unfavourable developments substantially weakened its growth performance, as well as its fiscal and balance of payments positions. Since 2011, the Union has expressed its unequivocal commitment to supporting Tunisia in its economic and political reform process. It has increased its financial support to Tunisia, strengthening its cooperation in many fields, including the civil society the electoral system, security, regional development and social and economic reforms. And it has offered the possibility of concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement, the negotiations of which were launched in October 2014. Tunisia reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion, which was approved by the IMF Board on June 2013, and which was subsequently extended until December 2015. It also requested in August 2013 complementary Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU. In response, the European Commission proposed a MFA of EUR 250 million in December 2013 in the form of loans (MFA-I), which the co-legislators raised to EUR 300 million and approved in May 2014 (Decision No 534/2014/EU). This amount is being successfully implemented. Following the completion of the 6th review of the IMF programme last September, Tunisia requested a successor arrangement with the IMF, probably of a 4-year duration. The new IMF programme is still under negotiation but expected to be sent for IMF Board approval in the spring of 2016. In 2015, the Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by several terrorist attacks that have targeted key economic industries like tourism and transport as well as aiming to disrupt the consolidation of its political transition. In this context, Tunisia requested a second MFA operation from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million, which would accompany the successor IMF programme. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Tunisia for a total maximum amount of EUR 500 million, provided in the form of a medium term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2016-17, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance, to be disbursed in three instalments (EUR 200 million, EUR 150 million and EUR 150 million, respectively), should help the country overcome its difficult economic and balance of payments situation it is experiencing, which has been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks it suffered in 2015 and by persistent domestic and regional unrest. It will also promote structural reforms aimed at raising sustainable economic growth and improving public finance management. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. The disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment). In addition, the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (""the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2016 for a total amount of EUR 350 million and the third loan disbursement in 2017 for the amount of EUR 150 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-2019 budgets. The implications on expenditure (including human resources and administrative costs) are estimated at EUR 45.295 million for 2016-2019."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may only adopt the act if Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) is the International Commodity Body (ICB) for cotton. Its mission is to assist governments in fostering a healthy world cotton economy. ICAC acts as a statistical observer and brings together producing, consuming, and trading countries and all segments of the cotton industry. It has an overall facilitating role. To date, the ICAC is one of the few ICBs1 where the European Union is not a member, whereas nine Member States have been members of the ICAC in their own right (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain). Membership of ICAC is in the interest of the Union, owing to the significance of cotton to the Union's economy. On various occasions (namely in its conclusions of 2004, 2008 and 2010), the Council of the European Union has requested the European Commission to consider EU membership of ICAC. It authorised the Commission in 2013 to negotiate, on behalf of the European Union and on the basis of negotiating directives, the accession of the Union to ICAC. CONTENT: with this draft decision, the Council is called upon to permit the EU to accede to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, on behalf of the Union. The Union will pay a contribution in line with the ICAC Rules and Regulations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: ICAC membership is based on the payment of an annual contribution. It is calculated on an annual basis as a function of the number of ICAC's members (fixed part) and the volume of raw cotton traded by each member (variable part). A first contribution of maximum EUR 400 000 would be required, which will give the EU an appropriate influence in ICAC affairs and allow broad EU involvement in ICAC's activities."
1454EP7,"""""EU guarantee to the EIB against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the EU""""",0.579,0.806,0.86,0.161,0.212,0.807,0.805,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to grant an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU provides a budgetary guarantee to the EIB covering risks of a sovereign and political nature in connection with its loan and loan guarantee operations carried out outside the EU in support of EU external policy objectives. The overall scope and general conditions of the EU guarantee coverage for EIB external operations have been set out in previous Council decisions, the EIB external mandates. Most recently, the EIB external mandate for the period 2007-2011 was established by Decision No 633/2009/EC of 13 July 2009, which requires the Commission to present a mid-term report on its application accompanied by a proposal for its amendment, drawing on an external evaluation. On the basis of findings of the mid-term review, this proposal aims to ensure the continuation of the EU guarantee for EIB external financing for the remainder of the current financial perspectives 2007-2013, whilst introducing a number of new elements in the mandate. The introduction of these new elements necessitated a number of modifications to the current mandate Decision. For the sake of clarity, it was therefore chosen to replace the mandate Decision with a new decision rather than presenting a proposal for amendments. LEGAL BASES: Articles 209 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the EU. CONTENT : the proposed decision will cover EIB financing operations signed during the period beginning on 1 February 2007 and ending on 31 December 2013.The new elements to be introduced in the new decision are the following: activation of the EUR 2 billion ""optional mandate"", which was placed in reserve by the Decision. This optional mandate will be activated not as an increase of individual regional ceilings, but as a mandate dedicated to projects which contribute to the fight against climate change across all regions covered by the decision; replacing the current system of regional objectives for operations under EU guarantee with horizontal high-level objectives covering all regions under the external mandate. These high-level objectives will be included in the Articles of the proposed decision and will cover the areas of climate change, social and economic infrastructure and local private sector development; development by the Commission, together with the EIB, and in consultation with the European External Action Service (EEAS), of operational guidelines for each region under the external mandate, reflecting EU regional strategies in order to strengthen the link between the implementation of EIB activities in line with the general high-level objectives under the external mandate and EU regional priorities; strengthening of the capacity of the EIB to support EU development objectives through (i) enhancing the EIB's appraisal and monitoring of social and development aspects of projects; (ii)increasing the focus of EIB intervention in sectors which will further the development of third countries, such as environmental infrastructure including water and sanitation, sustainable transportation and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The EIB should also progressively increase its activity in support of health and education; activation of the EIB external mandate for Iceland, Belarus, Libya, Iraq and, Cambodia. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Guarantee Fund for external actions set up by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, provisioned by yearly transfers from the general EU budget, provides a buffer for the EU budget against shocks due to losses on EIB external financing operations. The forecasts take into account the impact of the EUR 2 billion ""optional mandate"" on the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund. On the basis of the 9% provisioning rate, the financial impact of the allocation of the EUR 2 billion on the provisioning of the Fund will amount to a maximum of EUR 180 million over the period 2012-2020, on the assumption that the corresponding loans are fully disbursed. The budgetary implications as regards the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund as well as the human and administrative resources involved in the administration of the EU guarantee for 2011-2013 is as follows:"
6836EP7,"""""Posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services""""",0.877,0.81,0.93,0.226,0.242,0.867,0.318,0.029,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish a general common framework of provisions for better enforcement in practice of Directive 96/71/EC, including measures to prevent and sanction any abuse and circumvention of the applicable rules. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it can be estimated that around one million workers are posted each year by their employers from one Member State to another. Posting thus concerns 0.4% of the active population of EU-15 sending countries and 0.7% of the active population of EU-12 sending countries. In terms of labour mobility within the EU, the number of postings represented 18.5% of non-national EU-27 citizens in the labour force in 2007. The economic importance of posting exceeds by far its quantitative size, as it can play a crucial economic role in filling temporary shortfalls in the labour supply in certain professions or sectors (e.g. construction and transport). Furthermore, the posting of workers enhances international trade in services with all advantages linked to the Single Market such as higher competition, and efficiency gains. Posted workers are covered by Directive 96/71/EC (the Posting of Workers Directive). The Directive aims to reconcile the freedom to provide cross-border services under Article 56 TFEU with appropriate protection of the rights of workers temporarily posted abroad for that purpose. It sets out mandatory rules at EU level that must be applied to posted workers in the host country, and establishes a core set of clearly defined terms and conditions of work and employment that must be complied with by the service provider in the host country to ensure the minimum protection of workers. The Directive thus provides a significant level of protection for workers and also plays a key role in promoting a climate of fair competition between all service providers by guaranteeing both a level playing field and legal certainty for service providers, service recipients, and workers posted for the provision of services. However, the Commission’s evaluation of the Directive in 2003 identified several deficiencies and problems of incorrect implementation. Guidelines adopted in 2006 aimed at clarifying the extent to which certain national control measures could be justified in view of the Court of Justice’s jurisprudence. In its Communication of 2007 the Commission highlighted several shortcomings as regards the way controls were carried out in some Member States and the poor quality of administrative cooperation and access to information. The judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking-Line, Laval, Rüffert and Commission v Luxembourg cases triggered an intense debate among EU institutions, academics and social partners. This focused on two major issues: · how to set the right balance between the exercise by trade unions of their right to take collective action, including the right to strike, and the economic freedoms enshrined in the TFEU, in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services; · how to interpret some key provisions in Directive 96/71/EC, such as the concept of public policy, the material scope of the terms and conditions of employment imposed by the Directive and the nature of mandatory rules, in particular the minimum wage. In October 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution, calling on all Member States properly to enforce the Posting of Workers Directive and emphasised that the freedom to provide services as one of the cornerstones of the European project should be balanced, on the one hand, against fundamental rights and the social objectives of the Treaties and on the other hand, against the right of the public and social partners to ensure non-discrimination, equal treatment and the improvement of living and working conditions. By facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition, this initiative will allow the potential for growth offered by the posting of workers and jobs for posted workers to be tapped as a key element in the provision of services in the internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives based on an external study. All options were analysed against the following specific objectives: · better protection of the rights of posted workers; · facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition; · improving legal certainty as regards the balance between social rights and economic freedoms, in particular in the context of the posting of workers. The preferred option is a combination of different measures. A package of regulatory measures to deal with the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of the minimum working conditions and with the abuse of posted worker status in order to evade or circumvent legislation, combined with non- regulatory measures to deal with controversial or unclear interpretation of the terms and conditions of employment required by Directive 96/71/EC, is considered to be overall the most effective and efficient solution to address the specific objectives. Furthermore, a positive impact on SMEs and especially micro-businesses can be expected thanks to the improved and clearer regulatory environment. Micro-businesses will not be excluded from the of the proposal scope because this would undermine one of the proposal's key objectives - the fight against letter box companies - and it would create considerable new loopholes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: without re-opening Directive 96/71/EC, this proposal aims to improve, enhance and reinforce the way in which the latter Directive is applied and enforced in practice across the EU. It aims to establish a general common framework of appropriate provisions and measures for better and more uniform implementation, application and enforcement of the Directive, including measures to prevent any circumvention or abuse of the rules. It ensures at the same time guarantees for the protection of posted workers’ rights and the removal of unjustified obstacles to the free provision of services. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a Regulation clarifying the exercise of the right to take collective action within the context of the economic freedoms of the Single Market. Preventing abuse and circumvention - elements improving implementation and better monitoring of application of the notion of posting: the proposal: · clarifies the definition of ‘posted worker’ laid down in Directive 96/71/EC42, since it has often been difficult to determine whether there is a posting within the meaning of the Directive. Abuses have also been committed by employers exploring insufficient clarity of the legal provisions in order to circumvent the applicable rules; · the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place is further clarified in the context of administrative cooperation. Access to information: access to advance information about the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country is a prerequisite for interested parties to be able to provide services in compliance with Directive 96/71/EC. The proposal contains a number of more detailed measures to help ensure easily accessible and generally available information on the terms and conditions to be respected, including where these are laid down in collective agreements. Administrative cooperation and mutual assistance : the proposal lays down: · the general principles, rules and procedures necessary for effective administrative cooperation and assistance; · the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place; · an appropriate legal basis for the use of the separate and specific application of the Internal Market Information System (‘IMI’) as the electronic information exchange system to facilitate administrative cooperation on the posting of workers; · accompanying measures to develop, facilitate, support, promote and further improve administrative cooperation and to increase mutual trust, including through financial support. Monitoring compliance : these provisions cover national control measures, including those which may be applied to legally resident and lawfully employed third-country nationals who are posted within the EU by their employer, as well as inspections. A review clause has been included in order to evaluate the situation further, in particular to examine the necessity and appropriateness of the application of national control measures in the light of the experiences with the functioning of the system of administrative cooperation as well as technological developments. In its case law, the ECJ has further clarified the compatibility of certain national control measures with EU law. The Commission discusses the relevant case law and states that it is considered appropriate to clarify this case law by codifying it in the proposal, indicating clearly which requirements are compatible with obligations under EU law and which are not. By complying with their obligations, Member States would substantially contribute to reducing administrative burdens and SMEs would benefit from better enforcement of the existing Directive, a more level playing field and fairer competition. Improved administrative cooperation and effective and adequate inspections based on risk assessment would make inspections more effective and reduce costs for companies in non-risk sectors or situations and thus contribute to less burdensome controls. Furthermore, effective and adequate inspections, primarily based on regular risk assessment by the competent authorities, should be carried out in order to control and monitor compliance with the applicable rules. In order to reflect the different industrial relations systems and diversity of systems of control in the Member States, other actors and/or bodies may also monitor certain terms and conditions of employment of posted workers, such as the minimum rates of pay and working time. Enforcement: the proposal sets out provisions on the enforcement and defence of rights, which in itself concerns a fundamental right: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union confirms the right to effective remedy for everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the EU are not respected. Complaint mechanisms : the proposal sets out provisions on effective mechanisms for posted workers to lodge complaints directly or through designated third parties, such as trade unions, subject to their approval. Joint and several liabilities : the protection of workers rights is a matter of particular concern in subcontracting chains, which are particularly widespread in the construction sector in the EU. There is evidence that, in a number of cases, posted workers are exploited and left without payment of wages or part of the wages they are entitled to under the Directive 96/71/EC. The European Parliament has adopted several resolutions on this issue, calling upon the Commission to establish a legislative instrument on joint and several liability at EU level, in particular for long subcontracting chains (see However, a cautious approach is required in this respect in order to take due account of the variety of legal systems in place in the Member States, as well as the impact such a system may have on cross-border service provision within the Internal Market. The proposal contains specific provisions concerning contractors’ obligations and (joint and several) liability with respect to compliance with the relevant terms and conditions of employment of posted workers by subcontractors. The focus is on preventive measures, combined with the possibility for Member States who so wish to implement more far-reaching systems of joint and several or chain liability. The provisions are limited to the construction sector, as defined by the list of activities included in the Annex to the Directive. Posting by temporary work agencies is included provided it is aimed at activities in the construction sector. However, Member States may, if they so wish, extend these provisions to other sectors. This balanced package of measures should reflect sufficiently the diversity of existing systems at national level, while at the same time avoiding adding unnecessary or unjustified administrative burden for companies. Joint and several liability is a mechanism of self-regulation between private actors and a far less restrictive and more proportionate system than possible alternative systems such as pure state intervention by inspections and sanctions. Cross-border enforcement of administrative fines and penalties : the absence of a common mutual recognition and enforcement instrument has been identified as causing major practical enforcement problems and difficulties. In a number of Member States the sanctions imposed are of a penal or criminal nature, whereas in others they are governed by administrative law, and a combination of the two can also be found. Existing EU instruments, such as Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA and the Brussels I Regulation, govern to a certain extent some of the fines and penalties imposed. With respect to fines and penalties of an administrative nature, which can be appealed to courts other than penal courts, similar instruments do not exist. Therefore, the proposal sets out a system for the cross-border enforcement of such administrative fines and penalties. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is expected to have implications for the EU budget: costs for grants (projects, seminars, exchange of good practice etc) of EUR 2 million as well as for the Expert Committee on the Posting of Workers of EUR 0. 264 million per year will be covered by PROGRESS (2013) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation (2014-2020); costs of EUR 0.5 million for an ex-post evaluation study in 2016 will be covered by the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; costs for human resources of EUR 0.232 million and other administrative expenditure (travel costs EUR 0.01 million; stakeholder conferences every second year EUR 0.36 million) will be covered under heading 5 of the Multiannual Financial Framework."
3632EP7,"""""External Borders Fund""""",0.439,0.813,0.982,0.355,0.455,0.916,0.846,0.714,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to increase the co-financing rate of the External Borders Fund for certain Member States experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and amending Decision No 574/2007/EC. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision No 574/2007/EC establishes the External Borders Fund for the period 2007 to 2013 as part of the General programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ and provides for different Union co-financing rates for actions supported by the Fund. The unprecedented global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability, provoking a marked deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several Member States. Some Member States are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, particularly with respect to their financial and economic stability, leading to deterioration in their deficit and debt positions and threatening economic growth heightened by the international economic and financial environment. Ensuring the smooth implementation of programmes adopted under the four Funds established as part of the General Programme on ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ (‘the Funds’), is of particular importance as a means of injecting funds into the economy. To make European Union funding easier to manage in the area of migration, asylum and external borders and to improve the availability of funding for the Member States to implement their annual programmes under the Funds, it is necessary, on a temporary basis and without prejudice to the 2014-2020 programming period, to arrange for an increase in the Union co-financing rate under the Funds, by an amount corresponding to twenty percentage points above the co-financing rates currently applicable, for Member States experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal regarding similar amendments of the European Refugee Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals (please see COD/2012/0252 ). LEGAL BASIS: Article 77(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no consultation of external stakeholders. The proposal will allow the Commission to apply higher co-financing rates for the countries benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. CONTENT: in order to ensure that Member States benefiting from a financial support mechanism continue to implement the programmes adopted under the Funds on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the proposal contains provisions that would allow the Commission to increase the Union co-financing rate for these countries, for the period during which they benefit from financial assistance provided by one of the support mechanisms under any funding instruments. This will provide additional financial resources to the Member States and will make it easier to continue implementing the programmes on the ground. The Funds’ annual national allocation pursuant to the basic acts will remain unchanged while national co-financing will be reduced accordingly. Ongoing annual programmes will need to be revised to reflect the changes resulting from the application of the increased Union co-financing rate. The proposal makes provision for the amendment of Article 16 of Decision No 574/2007/EC to allow the Union co-financing rate applicable to the External Borders Fund programmes of the Member States concerned to be increased by 20 percentage points, provided they are benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. Annual programme : once a decision granting financial assistance to a Member State under one of the support mechanisms has been taken, the Member State may submit to the Commission either a draft annual programme or a draft revised annual programme applying the increased Union co-financing rate. To be entitled to apply the increased Union co-financing rate, a Member State must benefit from one of the support mechanisms at the time of submitting its draft annual programme or draft revised annual programme. These are: medium-term financial assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 ; financial assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 or financial assistance from other euro area Member States before the entry into force of that Regulation; financial assistance in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement reached establishing the European Financial Stability Facility or the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism. However, once an action of a specific annual programme has been co-financed at the increased Union co-financing rate, it remains so until the end of the eligibility period of the related annual programme whether or not the Member State still benefits from one of the support mechanisms. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modifications are proposed to the maximum amounts of the Funds' financing provided for in the annual programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. The proposal states that it shows the Commission's willingness to assist Member States in their efforts to deal with the financial crisis. The amendments will provide the Member States concerned with the necessary funds to support projects and economic recovery."
5527EP7,"""""Award of concession contracts""""",0.86,0.828,0.895,0.355,0.242,0.94,0.897,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to guarantee transparency, fairness and legal certainty in the award of concession contracts. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: public procurement plays a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. The award of works concessions is presently subject to basic rules of Directive 2004/18/EC on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts while the award of services concessions with a cross-border interest is subject to the principles of the Treaty, and in particular the principle of free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services as well as to the principles deriving therefrom such as equal treatment, non-discrimination, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency. There is a risk of legal uncertainty related to different interpretations of the principles of the Treaty by national legislators and of wide disparities among the legislations of different Member States. Such risk has been confirmed by the extensive case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union but which has only partially addressed certain aspects of the award of concession contracts. The absence of clear rules at Union level governing the award of concession contracts gives rise to legal uncertainty and to obstacles to the free provision of services and causes distortions in the functioning of the Internal Market. As a result, economic operators, in particular Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are being deprived of their rights within the Internal Market and miss out on important business opportunities, An adequate legal framework for the award of concessions would ensure effective and non-discriminatory access to the market to all Union economic operators and legal certainty, favouring public investments in infrastructures and strategic services to the citizen. Hence, a uniform concretisation of the Treaty principles across all Member States and the elimination of discrepancies in their understanding following therefrom is necessary at the Union level in order to eliminate persisting distortions of the Internal Market. The Commission announced the intention to adopt a legislative initiative on concessions in its communication “The Single Market Act Twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence” of 13 April 2011. This draft is being put forward in tandem with the revision of Public Procurement Directives (COD/2011/0438 and COD/2011/0439). It will result in the adoption of a separate legal instrument regulating the award of concessions which, together with the two proposals to revise Public Procurement Directives (2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC), aims at creating a modern public procurement legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the final impact assessment report confirmed the need for new legislation. It found that economic operators are faced with an unlevel playing field, which often leads to missed business opportunities. The optimal solution identified was legislation based on the current provisions on public works concessions, adequately adjusted and supplemented with certain specific provisions. A more restrictive approach, would be to extend to concessions the provisions that apply to public contracts. This approach was considered counter-productive in that it could potentially discourage contracting authorities from using concessions. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53 (1), Article 62 and Article 114 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposed Directive is expected to guarantee transparency, fairness and legal certainty in the award of concession contracts, and thereby contribute to improved investment opportunities and ultimately to more and better quality of works and services. It will apply to concessions awarded after its entry into force. This provision is in line with rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union on modifying contracts. (1) Legal certainty : the main objective of the Directive is to provide for clarity on the legal framework applicable to the award of concessions, but another is to clearly delimit the scope of application of this framework. Definition : the present proposal for a Directive on the award of concession contracts provides for a more precise definition of concession contracts with reference to the notion of operational risk. It makes clear what types of risk are to be considered operational and how to define significant risk. It also provides references as to the maximum duration of concessions. Incorporation of Treaty obligations into secondary law : the proposal extends the majority of the obligations which currently apply to the award of public works concessions to all services concessions. . It also lays down a number of concrete and more precise requirements, applicable at different stages of the award process on the basis of the Treaty principles, as interpreted in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Moreover, it extends the application of secondary law to the award of concession contracts in the utilities sector, which is currently exempt from such legislation. Public-public cooperation : there is considerable legal uncertainty as to how far cooperation between public authorities should be covered by public procurement rules. The relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union is interpreted differently between Member States and even between contracting authorities. Hence the present proposal clarifies the cases in which contracts concluded between contracting authorities are not subject to the application of concession award rules. Such clarification is guided by the principles set out in the relevant case law of the Court of Justice. Modifications : a specific provision on modifying concessions incorporates the basic solutions developed in the case law and provides a pragmatic solution for dealing with unforeseen circumstances requiring an a concession to be modified during its term. (2) Better access to the concessions markets: the proposal provides for a fundamental improvement economic operators' access to the concessions markets. The provisions are primarily designed to increase the transparency and fairness of award procedures by restricting the arbitrariness of contracting authorities and contracting entities' decisions on such issues as prior and post-publication, procedural safeguard, selection and award criteria and the deadlines imposed on tenderers. Furthermore, they provide for a better access to justice in order to prevent or to address violations of those provisions. Publication in the Official Journal : in order to ensure transparency and equal treatment to all economic operators, the present proposal provides for compulsory publication of concession contracts with a value equal to or greater than EUR 5 000 000. Deadlines : this proposal also sets a minimum deadline for the submission of interest in any concession award procedure, amounting to 52 days, as this is currently the case for public works concessions. It has been decided to provide for concessions a longer deadline than in case of public contracts, given that concession contracts are usually more complex. Selection and exclusion criteria : the rules are less restrictive than similar provisions currently applicable to public contracts. However, they restrict the selection criteria to those related to the economic, financial and technical capacity of the bidder and limit the scope of the acceptable exclusion criteria. Award criteria : the proposal provides for an obligation to apply objective criteria linked to the subject matter of the concession, ensuring compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment, guaranteeing that tenders are assessed in conditions of effective competition allowing an overall economic advantage for the contracting authority or the contracting entity to be determined. These criteria should prevent arbitrary decisions by contracting authorities and contracting entities and must be published in advance and listed in descending order of importance. Member States or contracting authorities or contracting entities which so wish, may also provide for or apply the ‘most economically advantageous tender’ criterion for the award of concessions. Procedural guarantees : unlike the Public Procurement Directives, the proposed rules do not contain a fixed catalogue of award procedures. This solution allows contracting authorities and contracting entities to follow more flexible procedures when awarding concessions notably reflecting national legal traditions and permitting the award process to be organised in the most efficient way. However, the proposal establishes a number of clear procedural safeguards to be applied to the award of concessions notably during negotiations. These safeguards aim at ensuring that the process is fair and transparent. Remedies : this proposal provides for an extension of the scope of application of the Remedies Directives (Directives 89/665/EEC and 92/13/EC, as amended by Directive 2007/66/EC) to all concession contracts above the threshold in order to guarantee effective channels for challenging the award decision in court and provide minimal judicial standards which have to be observed by contracting authorities or entities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
4259EP7,"""""Adjustment rate to direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2013""""",0.088,0.773,0.93,0.29,0.515,0.699,0.662,0.686,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to apply the financial discipline adjustment rate to amounts in excess of EUR 5000, to be granted to farmers for aid applications lodged in calendar year 2013. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure for the 2014 draft budget showed the need to reduce the total amount of direct payments that can be granted to farmers in respect of calendar year 2013 by EUR 1 471.4 million through financial discipline, in order to respect the EAGF net ceiling for financial year 2014 and establish the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector (EUR 424.5 million). As a consequence, the level of direct payments should be reduced in order to comply with the ceiling. On this basis, the Commission presents a proposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013, which must be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2013 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. However, if this adjustment rate has not been set by 30 June 2013, the Commission will set that rate pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal implements the rules provided for in Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. Prior consultation with the interested parties and the preparation of an impact assessment were not needed. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT : the draft regulation provides that the amounts of direct payments within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 5000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2013 shall be reduced by 4.981759 %. The reduction provided for shall not apply in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. The unequal distribution of direct payments between small and large beneficiaries remains a cause for concern for the Common Agricultural Policy. The draft regulation proposes to apply the financial discipline adjustment rate to amounts in excess of EUR 5000 in order to contribute to achieving the objective of a more balanced distribution of payments. This is in line with what is proposed on financial discipline in the context of the CAP reform, presented by the Commission in its proposal for a regulation establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial discipline adjustment rate of 4.981759 % has been calculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts in excess of EUR 5000 and not in all Member States. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2013 (financial year 2014). The total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 1471.4 million. The adjustment rate has been calculated taking into account the estimated share of direct payments to be granted to farmers below EUR 5000 for each direct payment scheme subject to financial discipline and for each Member State, except Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. Since direct payments in Bulgaria, Romania and in Croatia, subject to accession, are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2013, the financial discipline will not apply to them as a consequence. It should be noted that the final calculation of the financial discipline rate will depend on the sub-ceiling under Heading 2 set by the Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 and the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Council Directive 96/53/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: it has become crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of petroleum products in the field of transport, and even more crucial for road transport, which accounts for 82% of the energy consumption of the transport sector. Furthermore, the steady rise in the price of fuel prompts the need to identify solutions to reduce vehicle fuel consumption. In the light of the evolving market and the technologies available, the question today is whether the choices made when the Directive was adopted in 1996 are still relevant. The White Paper on Transport Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system published in 2011 set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2050 in comparison with 1990 levels. In this context, the White Paper announced the revision of the 1996 Directive, with the aim of allowing more energy- efficient, aerodynamic vehicles to be put on the market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposed measures are the result of public and sectoral consultations held in 2011 and 2012 and organized by the Commission. They were examined in an impact assessment which looked at several options in terms of economic and environmental efficiency. The option selected combines technical harmonisation work conducted with a group of experts with a view to adopting delegated acts and a moderate regulatory approach, in order to avoid imposing disproportionate or inapplicable obligations, which would penalise small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Directive 96/53/EC to improve the aerodynamics of vehicles and their energy efficiency, while continuing to improve road safety, and within the limits imposed by the geometry of road infrastructures. Specifically, the proposal: grants derogations from the maximum dimensions of vehicles for the addition of aerodynamic devices to the rear of vehicles or to redefine the geometry of the cabs for tractors, improving drivers’ field of vision, and improving their safety and comfort. The Commission will, with the assistance of a Committee, specify these requirements at a later stage; authorises a weight increase of one tonne for vehicles with an electric or hybrid propulsion, to take account of the weight of batteries or the dual motorisation, without prejudice to the load capacity of the vehicle. Furthermore, the maximum weight of buses will be increased by a tonne to take account of various developments such as the increase in the average weight of passengers and their baggage, of new equipment imposed by the safety regulations, and the new Euro VI class; will facilitate the development of intermodal transport by allowing a derogation of 15 cm in the length of trucks carrying 45-foot containers, which are increasingly used in intercontinental and European transport; confirms that cross-border use of longer vehicles is lawful for journeys that only cross one border, if the two Member States concerned already allow it and if the conditions for derogations under the Directive are met; adds new provisions to enable the inspection authorities to better detect infringements and harmonise administrative penalties that apply to them. The Commission will publish guidelines on inspection procedures to ensure harmonisation of inspection methods between all Member States. The latter must carry out a minimum number of vehicle checks, using either weighing systems built into the road or by means of onboard sensors in vehicles that communicate remotely with roadside inspectors. The Commission will define the technical standards for onboard weighing devices that can communicate with the inspection authorities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. In order to accelerate the introduction of vehicles that are more aerodynamic and have hybrid motorisation, the Commission will use the budgets at its disposal, in particular those allocated to trans-European networks and the EU programmes for research, development and innovation, to help industrial research, and equipping vehicle fleets. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between Gabon and the European Community was signed on 4 June 2007 and entered into force on 11 June 2007 for a period of six years. The agreement is renewable by tacit agreement and is still in force. A previous three-year protocol implementing the JPA entered into force on 24 July 2013 and expired on 23 July 2016. In 2015, the Commission carried out an ex-post evaluation of the 2013-2016 JPA protocol, as well as an ex-ante evaluation of a possible renewal of the protocol. The evaluation concluded that the EU fishing sector has a strong interest in operating in Gabon and that a renewal of the protocol would be in the interest of both parties. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Gabon with a view to concluding, on behalf of the EU, a new protocol for the implementation of the FPA (2021-2026). Following these negotiations, a protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 10 February 2021. The new protocol covers a period of five years from the date of its signature by both parties. The negotiation of a new protocol for the implementation of the sustainable fisheries partnership agreement with Gabon is part of the Union's external action towards the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and takes particular account of the Union's objectives regarding respect for democratic principles and human rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve the protocol for the implementation (2021-2026) of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Gabonese Republic and the European Community. Objectives The conclusion of the implementing protocol will allow the strategic partnership in the field of fisheries between the European Union and Gabon to be continued and strengthened. The conclusion of the protocol will create fishing opportunities for EU vessels in the Gabonese fishing zone. The agreement and the protocol will also contribute to: - better management and conservation of fisheries resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the global plan for fisheries, the monitoring of and fight against illegal fishing, and support for the artisanal fisheries sector; - Gabon's sustainable exploitation of its marine resources and Gabon's fisheries economy by promoting growth in fisheries-related economic activities and the establishment of decent working conditions. Fishing opportunities The new protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - 27 purse seine tuna vessels; - 6 pole-and-line tuna vessels; - support vessels in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the limits set by Gabonese legislation; - 4 trawlers targeting demersal fish and crustaceans to be authorised according to the results of exploratory campaigns. Financial contribution The annual financial contribution amounts to EUR 2 600 000, based on: (a) an annual amount of EUR 1 600 000 for access to fisheries resources in the Gabonese fishing zone, equivalent to a reference tonnage for highly migratory species of 32 000 tonnes per year; (b) support for the development of Gabon's sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 1 000 000 per year. This support is in line with the objectives of the strategic plan for fisheries in Gabon. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations will be established during the annual budget procedure."
2303EP7,"""""Short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps""""",0.053,0.791,0.807,0.548,0.485,0.458,0.856,0.114,0,0,0,0,"BACKGROUND: short selling of securities is a practice where a natural or legal person sells a security he does not own with the intention of buying back an identical security at a later point in time. It is an established and common practice in most financial markets. Short selling can be divided into two types: covered short selling where the seller has borrowed the security, or made arrangements to ensure they can be borrowed before the short sale and uncovered or naked short selling (where at the time of the short sale the seller has not borrowed the securities or ensured they can be borrowed). At the height of the financial crisis, in September 2008, competent authorities in several EU Member States and the USA adopted emergency measures to restrict or ban short selling in some or all securities. The measures adopted by Member States were divergent as the European Union lacks a specific legislative framework for dealing with short selling issues. Earlier this year concerns were expressed by some Member States about the possible role played by derivative transactions, notably credit default swaps, in relation to the prices for Greek sovereign bonds. A number of Member States (notably Germany and Greece) have recently adopted temporary or permanent restrictions at national level relating to short selling of shares and/or credit default swaps. The current fragmented approach to short selling and credit default swaps limits the effectiveness of supervision and the measures imposed and results in regulatory arbitrage. It may also create confusion in markets and costs and difficulties for market participants. In its communication of 2 June 2010 on Regulating Financial Services for Sustainable Growth, the Commission considered that it would be desirable to have a regulation addressing the potential risks arising from short selling. The intention is to i) harmonise requirements relating to short selling across the European Union, ii) harmonise the powers that regulators may use in exceptional situations where there is a serious threat to financial stability or market confidence and iii) ensure greater co-ordination and consistency between Member States in such situations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options related to the scope of the proposals, the proposed transparency regimes, requirements relating to uncovered short selling, exemptions and exceptional powers to restrict short selling. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Although all the problems outlined above have important implications for each individual Member State, their overall impact can only be fully perceived in a cross-border context. CONTENT: the proposal covers all financial instruments but provides for a proportionate response to the risks that that short selling of different instruments may represent. Its main features are as follows: Transparency requirements for short positions in certain instruments: for instruments such as shares and derivatives relating to shares, sovereign bonds and derivatives relating to sovereign bonds and credit default swaps relating to sovereign issuers where taking short positions is more common and there are clearly identifiable risks or concerns, transparency requirements and requirements relating to uncovered short selling are applied. For companies that have shares admitted to trading on a trading venue in the Union, the proposal provides for a two tier model for transparency of significant net short positions in shares. At a lower threshold notification of a position must be made privately to the regulator and at a higher threshold positions must be disclosed to the market. As regards significant net short positions relating to sovereign debt issuers in the EU, private disclosure to regulators is required. The proposal includes a requirement for the marking of short orders. A requirement for the marking or flagging of sell orders executed on trading venues as short orders where the seller is entering into a short sale of shares on that venue will provide additional information about volumes of short sales executed on the trading venue. A trading venue will be required to publish daily information about volumes of short sales executed on the venue that is obtained from the marking of orders. Uncovered short sales : uncovered or naked short selling of shares and sovereign debt is sometimes viewed as increasing the potential risk of settlement failure and market volatility. The proposals include detailed requirements aimed at addressing these risks. To this end, natural or legal persons entering into short sales of such instruments must at the time of the sale have borrowed the instruments, entered into an agreement to borrow the shares or made other arrangements which ensure that the security can be borrowed so that settlement can be effected when it is due. Furthermore, trading venues must ensure that there are adequate arrangements in place for buy-in of shares or sovereign debt where there is a failure to settle a transaction. Trading venues will have the power to prohibit a natural or legal person who failed to settle to enter into further short sales. Exemptions: provisions are made for exemptions – for example, for shares of a company where the principal market for the shares is outside the European Union and for market making activities which play a crucial role in providing liquidity to European markets. Intervention powers:  in exceptional situations which constitute a serious threat to financial stability or to market confidence, competent authorities should have temporary powers to require further transparency or to impose restrictions on short selling and credit default swap transactions or limit natural and legal persons from entering into derivative transactions. Where an adverse development or event creates a threat to financial stability or market confidence that extends beyond one Member State or has other cross border implications, the proposal introduces various procedural requirements aimed at ensuring that other competent authorities are notified if a competent authority intends to take exceptional measures related to short selling. The European Securities Market Authority ( ESMA ) is given a key coordination role in such a situation to try to ensure consistency between competent authorities. Powers and sanctions: t he proposal gives competent authorities all the powers necessary for the enforcement of the rules. For example, the powers cover access to documents, the right to obtain information from natural or legal persons and to take enforcement action."
5218EP9,"""""Transitional provisions for support from the EAFRD and EAGF in the years 2021 and 2022""""",0.065,0.044,0.014,0.233,0.105,0.009,0.0,0.049,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to ensure certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers and for rural development in the transitional period for those Member States that have used their 2014-2010 EAFRD allocations by extending the current legal framework until the new common agricultural policy (CAP) becomes applicable. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission’s legislative proposals on the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 aimed to make the CAP more responsive to current and future challenges such as climate change or generational renewal, while continuing to support farmers in the Union for a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Those proposals are closely linked to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) of the Union for the years 2021 to 2027. The legislative procedure was not concluded in time to allow Member States and the Commission to prepare all elements necessary to apply the new legal framework and the CAP Strategic Plans as of 1 January 2021, as initially proposed by the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure that support can be granted to farmers and other beneficiaries from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in 2021, the Union should continue to grant such support for one more year under the conditions of the existing legal framework, which covers the period 2014 to 2020. CONTENT: this proposal aims at providing certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers and ensuring the continuity of support for rural development in the transitional period for those Member States that have used their 2014-2010 EAFRD allocations by extending the current legal framework until the new CAP becomes applicable. In order to allow Member States to make the necessary adaptations at national level, these changes would need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament by mid-2020 Extension of the applicability of the existing regulations The existing legal framework is laid down in particular in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013, (EU) No 1307/2013, (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In addition, to facilitate the transition from existing support schemes to the new legal framework which covers the period starting on 1 January 2022, rules shall be laid down to regulate how certain support granted on a multiannual basis will be integrated into the new legal framework. In light of the fact that the Union should continue to support rural development in 2021, Member States, that demonstrate the risk to run out of funds and not to be able to undertake new legal commitments in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, shall have the possibility to extend their rural development programmes or certain of their regional rural development programmes supported by the EAFRD to 31 December 2021 and to finance those extended programmes from the corresponding budget allocation for the year 2021. Transition to the next CAP period The new CAP comes with significant changes. Transitional rules are needed to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period, in particular concerning the continuation of multiannual commitments undertaken in the current and previous programming periods. The Single CMO Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, including aid schemes for specific sectors. It sets out the parameters for intervening on agricultural markets and providing sector-specific support. To ensure coherence, most interventions of the new CAP will be part of one strategic CAP support plan per Member State, including several sectorial interventions that have previously been set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Under the current rules, the different sectoral programmes follow different time frames. To ensure coherence, continuity and a smooth transition between the aid schemes under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the sectoral types of interventions under the new CAP it is necessary to set rules regarding the duration of each of these aid schemes with respect to the entry into application of the Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans. For aid schemes in the fruit and vegetables sector and in the olive oil and table olives sector, it is necessary to regulate the continuation and modification of operational programmes and work programmes. Budgetary implications The current Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 on rural development and (EU) No 1307/2013 on direct payments do not lay down allocations for the transitional period (beyond calendar year 2020). Therefore, the initiative has a budgetary impact in the sense that it adds the allocations for direct payments and rural development for the relevant transitional period to ensure smooth continuity. These allocations are equal to those in the CAP Plan proposal and they are coherent with the Commission’s proposal on the MFF 2021-2027. Where Member States do not decide to prolong their current rural development programmes, the 2021 EAFRD allocations will be transferred to the 2022 – 2025 EAFRD allocations. Similarly, for the transitional period, the allocations contained in Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 need to be adjusted to respect the overall amounts for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) included in the MFF proposal. The reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is proposed to be maintained throughout the transitional period to ensure continuity. It is to be financed through financial discipline applied on direct payments. As such, it does not entail any additional expenditure. The present proposal is neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments. The impact as regards the estimated schedule for payment appropriations will depend on Member States decisions as regards the prolongation of the current rural development programmes. Similarly, any decision of Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development will be neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments but may have an impact in terms of timing of payments that however cannot be estimated."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he unprecedented global crisis that has hit the world over the last three years has seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in the government deficit and debt position of the Member States, leading a number of them to seek financial assistance outside the framework of the Union. The full consistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established by the Treaty and the possible policy conditions attached to this financial assistance should be enshrined in Union law. The economic and financial integration of the Member States whose currency is the euro calls for a reinforced surveillance to prevent a contagion from a Member State experiencing difficulties with respect to its financial stability to the rest of the euro area. The intensity of the economic and fiscal surveillance should be commensurate to the severity of the financial difficulties encountered and should take due account of the nature of the financial assistance received, which may range from a mere precautionary support based on eligibility conditions up to a full macro-economic adjustment programme involving strict policy conditionality IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on strengthened surveillance for the euro area builds on what has already been agreed in the ‘Six Pack’ set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December. It sets out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and/or that receive or may receive financial assistance from one or several other States, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or other International Financial Institutions (IFI), such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Enhanced surveillance : the proposed Regulation strengthening economic and fiscal surveillance of euro area countries facing or threatened with serious financial instability would ensure that the surveillance of these Member States under a financial assistance programme, or facing a serious threat of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law. The Commission would be able to decide whether a Member State experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability should be subject to enhanced surveillance. The Council would be able to issue a recommendation to such Member States to request financial assistance. A Member State under enhanced surveillance shall, in consultation and cooperation with the Commission, acting in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties. The Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under surveillance to verify the progresses made in the implementation of the measures. Where it is concluded that further measures are needed and the financial situation of the Member State concerned has significant adverse effects on the financial stability of the euro area, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may recommend to the Member State concerned to seek financial assistance and to prepare a macro-economic adjustment programme. The Council may decide to make this recommendation public. Where a recommendation is made public: (a) the relevant Committee of the European Parliament may invite representatives of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views; (b) representatives of the Commission may be invited by the parliament of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views. Macro-economic adjustment programme : a Member State receiving financial assistance from one or several other States, the IMF, the EFSF or the ESM shall prepare in agreement with the Commission - acting in liaison with the ECB - a draft adjustment programme aimed at re-establishing a sound and sustainable economic and financial situation and restoring its capacity to finance itself fully on the financial markets. The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall approve the adjustment programme. The Commission, in liaison with the ECB, shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the adjustment programme . It shall - in liaison with the ECB - examine with the Member State concerned the changes that may be needed to its adjustment programme. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide on any change to be made to the adjustment programme. Post-programme surveillance : a Member State shall be under post-programme surveillance as long as a minimum of 75% of the financial assistance received from one or several other Member State(s), the EFSM, the EFSF or the ESM has not been repaid. The Council, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend the duration of the post programme surveillance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe and the European Community entered into force on 29 August 20112 and has since been renewed automatically. The previous Protocol to the Agreement, which entered into force on 23 May 2014, expired on 22 May 2018. The evaluation report concluded that the Union’s tuna fishing sector has a strong interest in fishing in São Tomé and Príncipe and that a renewal of the Protocol would help strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance and contribute to improved governance of the fisheries in the region.

Objectives of the proposal The objective of the Protocol is to enable the Union and São Tomé and Príncipe to work more closely on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in São Tomé and Príncipe waters and to support efforts by São Tomé and Príncipe to develop its fisheries sector. Fishing opportunities In accordance with the priorities of the Fisheries Policy reform, the new Protocol provides fishing opportunities for Union vessels in São Tomé and Príncipe waters, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and following the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: (a) 28 freezer tuna seiners; (b) 6 surface longliners. The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 840 000, based on: - a reference tonnage of 8 000 tonnes per year, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR 400 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol; - support for the development of São Tomé and Príncipe’s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 440 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of São Tomé and Príncipe’s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure. The Commission is authorised to approve, on behalf of the Union, amendments to the Protocol to be adopted by the Joint Committee established under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: connected technologies account for 50% of productivity gains in recent years across all sectors. The Commission considers that they are the key for Europe to emerge stronger from the crisis, if impediments to growth arising from ongoing fragmentation are addressed. After over a decade of Union legislative interventions to liberalise and integrate the telecommunications market, Europe is fragmented into 28 separate national communications markets, each with a limited number of players. This patchy scenario raises barriers to entry and increases the costs for operators wanting to provide cross-border services thereby impeding their expansion. EU rules on, for example, authorisations, regulatory conditions, spectrum assignment and consumer protection are implemented in diverging ways. As a consequence, while no operator is present in more than half of the Member States, most in far fewer, overall more than 200 operators serve a market of 510 million of customers. This stands in stark contrast with the US or China who have one single market of 330 and 1400 million customers respectively, served by four to five large operators, with one legislation, one licensing system, and one spectrum policy. The untapped potential of an EU single market in electronic communications is estimated at up to 0.9% GDP, or EUR 110 billion per year. The benefits from a single market for business communication services alone amount to almost EUR 90 billion per year. In the wider economy, increasing ICT investment, improving e-skills in the labour force and reforming the conditions for the Internet economy could boost GDP by an additional 5% up to 2020, and create 3.8 million jobs. The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), one of the flagship initiatives of Europe 2020 Strategy, has already recognised the role of ICT and network connectivity as an indispensable basis for the development of our economy and society. The 2013 Spring European Council stressed the importance of the digital single market for growth and called for concrete measures, in order to establish a single market in information and communications technology (ICT) as early as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in order to tackle these sources of fragmentation, three policy options were selected for further analysis: option 1 was based on the regulatory framework for electronic communications as it stands; option 2 considered a single legislative instrument (a Regulation) adjusting the regulatory framework only where necessary for a single EU market for electronic communications, based on enhanced EU coordination; option 3 included the substance of the second option, but replaced the current governance structure by a single EU regulator in order to achieve full regulatory coordination. The impact assessment report concludes that the second option is the best available. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the general objective of the proposal is to move towards a single market for electronic communications in which: citizens and businesses can access electronic communications services wherever they are provided in the Union, without cross-border restrictions or unjustified additional costs; companies providing electronic communications networks and services can operate and provide them wherever they are established or their customers are situated in the EU. The proposal builds upon and advances the main directives of 2002 governing the provision of electronic communications, as amended in 2009, by introducing directly applicable legislative provisions which shall operate in conjunction with the provisions of the directives on subjects such as authorisation, spectrum assignment and access to networks. The main elements of this proposal are as follows: A single EU authorisation mechanism : operators wanting to provide services in several Member States must currently be authorised in each of them. The proposed Regulation introduces a single EU authorisation based on a single notification system in the Member State of main establishment of the European electronic communication provider (the home country) and sets out the conditions applicable to it. European inputs : mobile providers in Europe today lack the necessary predictability regarding spectrum availability across the EU and must deal with diverging assignment conditions. It is thus more difficult to plan long-term, to invest across borders and eventually to gain scale. Such a patchy situation means that device manufacturers design their products for other markets with greater scale and growth prospects. To put an end to this unsustainable situation, harmonisation of spectrum inputs must be ensured by: guaranteeing mobile operators predictable assignment conditions and coordinated timeframes to access spectrum for wireless broadband across the EU; harmonising ways to access European fixed networks so that providers can more easily offer their services across the single market. The proposal also ensures harmonised, high-quality virtual access to fixed networks would facilitate market entry and the provision of cross-border services both to end-users and businesses, and would help drive competition and investment. Rights of end-users : t o guarantee an appropriate level of consumer protection across the EU, rules defining the rights of end-users are harmonised, including: non-discrimination between certain domestic and intra-EU (international) communications (unless differences are objectively justified); mandatory pre-contractual and contractual information; increased transparency and facilities to avoid ""bill shocks""; the right to terminate the contract after six months without costs (excluding the residual value of any subsidised equipment or other promotions); the obligation on providers to provide unhindered connection to all content, applications or services being accessed by end-users – also referred to as Net Neutrality - while regulating the use of traffic management measures by operators in respect of general internet access. At the same time, the legal framework for specialised services with enhanced quality is clarified. Facilitating change of provider : the proposal provides for harmonised principles applicable to switching procedures are provided, such as cost-orientation, receiving provider-led process, automatic termination of contract with the transferring provider. This proposal, together with the Commission Recommendation on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing methodologies to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment environment, forms a set of balanced measures aimed at moving towards a Single Market in Telecommunications and fostering investment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal h as no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was signed on 20 December 2013. Illicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than €10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries. Since the illicit products mostly originate from countries outside the EU, international cooperation, in particular also based on clear legislative procedures, is key to addressing the problem of illicit trade. The FCTC Protocol currently constitutes the only multilateral regulatory initiative in the area. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. This Decision applies to the provisions of the Protocol which do not fall within the scope of Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Freedom, Security and Justice). The Protocol contains a complex set of measures, rules and policy in the field of fighting illicit trade in tobacco products. The Protocol provisions fall into different areas of EU activity which may be subdivided as follows: The Protocol: Those articles are complemented by provisions on: (i) record-keeping and security and preventive measures, including anti-money-laundering measures and reporting of suspicious transactions; (ii) sales by Internet; (iii) duty free sales of tobacco products and the obligation to implement effective controls on tobacco and tobacco products in the free zones, including not mixing tobacco products with non-tobacco products at the time of removal from a free zone. Part IV of the Protocol defines the conduct to be established as unlawful under the Parties’ legislation and obliges the Parties to ensure that natural and legal persons are held liable for such unlawful conduct, including criminal offences. Further provisions concern seizure payments, the handling of confiscated tobacco and special investigative techniques. Part V of the Protocol contains provisions for the exchange of relevant information between the Parties, cooperation and mutual assistance (both administrative and legal in relation to criminal matters), jurisdiction and extradition. In parallel to this proposal, the Commission presented a separate proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol, on behalf of the European Union, as regards provisions which fall under Title V of Part III of the TFEU."
5716EP8,"""""Accessibility requirements for products and services""""",0.8,0.756,0.96,0.417,0.212,0.925,0.864,0.154,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve the proper functioning of the internal market and remove and prevent barriers for the free movement of accessible products and services, including for disabled people. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission notes that the demand for accessible products and services is high and the number of citizens with disabilities and/or functional limitations will increase significantly with the ageing of the European Union's population. Taking into account demographic ageing, it is expected that in 2020 approximately 120 million persons in the European Union will have multiple and/or minor disabilities. An environment where products and services are more accessible allows for more inclusion and facilitates autonomy. Accessibility is at the heart of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which the EU is a party together with 25 of its Member States. It is one of the priorities of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 that sets actions for the implementation of the UNCRPD at EU level. Accessibility prevents or removes barriers to the use of mainstream products and services. It allows the perception, operation and understanding of those products and services by persons with functional limitations, on an equal basis with others. Differences in legislation, standards and guidelines on accessibility exist and are very likely to increase as Member States develop new accessibility rules. National authorities, manufacturers and service providers face uncertainties concerning the accessibility requirements for potential cross-border services, and concerning the policy framework applicable for accessibility. Harmonisation of national measures on accessibility is being proposed as a necessary condition to put an end to the legislative divergence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a preliminary screening showed that this EU initiative should only cover selected priority areas, where obstacles to the functioning of the single market were most visible and likely to increase or where action at European level would add more value. Regulatory intervention appeared to be the most efficient form of EU intervention for tackling current and expected problems in the functioning of the single market. CONTENT: the proposed Directive will provide for a common EU definition and implementation framework for accessibility requirements of certain products and services, so that the latter might benefit from free circulation on the internal market and ensure the full participation of persons with disabilities in society. The proposal is complementary to existing EU law addressing assistance to persons with disabilities or with reduced mobility like the regulation of passenger rights in all modes of transport (air, rail, waterborne, bus and coach). It also complements the proposal for a web accessibility Directive that covers in its scope only certain public sector websites. The main aspects of the proposal are as follows: Scope: the proposed directive aims to: harmonise accessibility requirements for a list of products and services , selected on the basis of the needs of industry and people with disabilities. It concerns particularly transport ticket machines and check-in machines, banking services, consumer terminal equipment, telephony and audio visual services, passenger transport services, e-books and e-commerce; use the same accessibility requirements to define and give content to the – already existing, but undefined – obligation of accessibility laid down in EU law, such as in the area of public procurement and the structural and investment Funds. Accessibility requirements and free movement : the proposed Directive ensures that all products and services complying with the accessibility requirements will benefit from free circulation on the internal market. It supports industry to address accessibility issues by using the same functional accessibility requirements to render operational the obligation to buy/fund accessible products and services as laid down in EU law. In line with the 'think small first' principle, light conformity assessment and safeguard clauses are introduced to protect economic operators from carrying a disproportionate burden or avoiding (the costs imposed by) the fundamental alteration of their products and services Implementation by Member States : the proposed directive: harmonises accessibility requirements at EU level for a number of products and services but does not prescribe in detail how the obligation to render a product or service accessible by complying with the defined accessibility requirements has to be achieved in practice. In case this still leads to obstacles in the internal market, the Commission can consider other options in the future to provide guidance to Member States such as standardisation or implementing measures; includes the option of using voluntary harmonised standards to provide presumption of conformity with the accessibility requirements; provides that Member States must transpose the Directive within two years after its entry into force at the latest; requires Member States to apply all measures, within six years after the entry into force of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited budgetary implications. The only operational costs relate to the preparation of the report on the application of this Directive, i.e. operational appropriation of EUR 0.2 million under the existing budget line, as well as administrative expenditure of around EUR 0.182 million per year after the adoption of the Directive for running the related committee meetings. This expenditure will be borne by internal redeployment and not entail an increase in funds."

It should be noted that the signature and provisional application of the Protocol are subject to a proposal for a separate Council decision. The conclusion of the Protocol on behalf of the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) follows a separate procedure, by which the Commission recommends that the Council gives its approval, pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 101 of the Treaty establishing the EAEC."
2517EP7,"""""Technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euros""""",0.86,0.916,0.93,0.516,0.424,0.916,0.892,0.086,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euros in the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the present proposal has to be seen in the context of the creation of an Internal Market for payment services in euro (Single Euro Payments Area or SEPA). Secure and efficient payment systems are crucial to the conduct of economic transactions and to the proper functioning of the Internal Market. Two years after the launch of the SEPA credit transfer, the number of SEPA credit transfers processed by clearing and settlement mechanisms located in the euro area has not yet reached the 10% threshold. A linear extrapolation of the current SCT migration rate of 9.3% (as of August 2010), suggests that it will take around 30 years to complete SEPA. Even in a more optimistic scenario, it seems very unlikely that SEPA migration will be completed in less than 15–20 years without additional legislative intervention. Although strongly supported by both the European Commission and the European Central Bank, SEPA was originally conceived as a primarily market-driven project. Union-wide schemes for credit transfers and direct debits were designed and implemented by the European Payments Council (EPC), a coordination and decision making body set up by the European banking sector to deliver SEPA. However, given the current slow rates of migration, there is increasing recognition by all categories of stakeholders that a legally binding end-date may be necessary to achieve successful project completion. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment, prepared in close cooperation with the ECB, considers three scenarios: no intervention, additional incentives for SEPA migration without setting an end-date and the impacts of setting a migration end-date. It concludes that the best scenario for the Union payments market, the European economy and the stakeholders is setting an end-date for migration by way of a Regulation. Subsequently, the impact assessment considers the best ways of implementing the end-date at the technical level, by discussing policy sub-options for the end-date implementation in several areas: i) the reference basis for adopting Union-wide credit transfers and direct debits: ii) the transaction domain; iii) product specification; iv) Member States scope; v) deadline for migration, and vi) clarity on the long term business model for pan-European direct debits. LEGAL BASE: Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for setting technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits is aimed at: setting up separate migration end-dates for credit transfers and direct debits respectively , by introducing a set of common standards and general technical requirements; ensuring reachability of payment service providers for credit transfer transactions , along the lines of the reachability obligation for direct debit transactions under Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 and interoperability of payment systems. The main features of the regulation are as follows: Purpose and scope : the proposal covers the execution of all credit transfer and direct debit transactions denominated in euros within the Union. It does not cover some types of payment transactions -such as payment card transactions, money remittance and payment transactions through means of any telecommunication, digital or IT device which do not result in a credit transfer or direct debit. To promote competition and efficiency, the Regulation should not foreclose from the market non-'traditional' payment schemes, in particular when they are based on combined schemes rules including a direct debit or credit transfer segment. Hence, the provisions of this Regulation only apply to the credit transfer or direct debit underlying the transaction. Definitions: these are aligned, as much as possible, with those used in Directive 2007/64/EC. However, given the Regulation’s limited scope in comparison with the Payment Services Directive, some of the definitions have been tailored to the needs of this proposal. Reachability of payment service providers for credit transfer transactions is integrated with the reachability obligation for direct debit transactions under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009. Technical interoperability : the proposal contains provisions which are necessary for the smooth functioning of payment schemes and systems, so that they can interact with each other across the Union using the same standards, without technical obstacles to the processing of payments by the market players. Technical requirements for credit transfer and direct debit transactions : the text introduces deadlines for migration to Union-wide instruments, by making certain important standards used by the payment industry mandatory and defining technical requirements applying to both payment service providers and customers. No later than 12 months after the entry into force of the Regulation, credit transfers shall be carried out in accordance with the technical requirements set out in the Annex. The deadline for direct debit transactions is set at 24 months after the entry into force of the Regulation. Interchange fees for direct debit transactions: the proposal clarifies that, after 31 October 2012, multilateral interchange fees (MIFs) per transaction are not allowed for national and cross-border direct debits. It also defines general conditions for interchange fees (multilateral, bilateral and unilateral) for R-transactions, in line with the working document on the 'Applicability of Article 81 of the EC Treaty to multilateral interbank-payments in SDD' published by the Commission on 3 November 2009. Waiver: this provision applies to so-called 'legacy' niche products which should also be phased out after an appropriate transitional period. Payment accessibility : the proposal ensures that if a euro credit transfer or a euro direct debit is accepted domestically, it will also be used to and from a euro account on a cross-border basis. Competent authorities : the competent authorities would be empowered to take necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in this Regulation. Penalties : Member States are required to provide details of penalties to the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: leaving aside the normal administrative costs linked to ensuring the respect of EU legislation, there will be no budgetary impact since no new committees are created and no financial commitments are made. However, the Commission is also a significant user of payment services in its own right and therefore should benefit, along with other users, from enhanced competition generated by SEPA."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Trinidad and Tobago and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 15 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Trinidad and Tobago on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Trinidad and Tobago to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Trinidad and Tobago may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Trinidad and Tobago remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Trinidad and Tobago reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Trinidad and Tobago to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union. The development in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation which occurred in the meantime require the amendment of some of its provisions. The main amendments proposed are as follows : Sugar: following the reform of the common organisation of the market of sugar, incorporated in the single CMO by Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, it is proposed that Article 5 be updated so that it reflects these new provisions and allows the Azores to integrate raw cane sugar in its forecast supply balance. In previous marketing years, the sugar beet production in the Azores was not sufficient to allow its sugar industry to fulfil their allocated quota and no significant quantities of raw beet sugar were available on the market. This amendment will improve their situation by allowing them to import raw cane sugar (within the limit of the forecast supply balance). Milk-based preparations : Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 provides for a transitional period during which the Canary Islands may continue to receive supplies of determined quantities of milk-based preparations falling within CN codes 1901 90 99 and 2106 90 92 intended for industrial processing. This transitional period expires on 31 December 2009. The product falling within CN code 1901 90 99 – skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat – is a traditional product for the local consumers, including the most deprived, and has been sold in the Canary Islands during the last 40 years. The supply of this product has generated a specific local industry ensuring employment and added value. In the current situation of economic crisis it is proposed to maintain the supply of this specific product and to extend the transitional period set by the Regulation to 31 December 2013. In the light of the experience gained by the Commission, and to ensure that the Community support programmes are implemented effectively and appropriately, it is necessary to remove references in that Regulation to checks and administrative penalties. However, such national measures will continue to be communicated to the Commission in accordance with the Regulation. Wine: following the wine reform of 2008 and the recent integration of the wine CMO into the single CMO, Article 18 needs to be updated to reflect the new provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 491/2009. French overseas department of Reunion : despite the recent development of the local milk production in Reunion, the current need for drinking milk consumption on the island is not sufficiently covered. Moreover, the remoteness and insularity of this region do not allow other sources of raw milk. Consequently, it is proposed that the authorisation to produce reconstituted UHT milk from milk powder of Community origin, granted to Madeira by the first subparagraph of Article 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006, should be extended to the French overseas department of Reunion. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : these programs have a high level of execution. As the proposed modifications to Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 do not change the annual ceiling amounts for the financing of the specific supply arrangements and of the measures in favour of local production, there is no budgetary impact.

BACKGROUND : the EU is a Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (""the Convention""), which established the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (""ICCAT""). At its 16th Special Meeting in 2008, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 08-05 to establish a new recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, and Regulation (EC) No 302/20095 was adopted to implement those international conservation measures at Union level. This was later amended by Regulation (EU) No 500/2012. At its 18th Special Meeting in 2012, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 12-03, which provides for: · a modification of the fishing seasons; · defining fishing seasons as open seasons, as opposed to closed seasons indicated in the previous ICCAT Recommendations; · a modification of the actual dates when fishing is permitted by purse seiners, bait boats and trolling boats; · explicitly allowing all other gears the possibility of fishing all year round to avoid any uncertainty for those gears which are not subject to any specific rules on fishing seasons. Pending the entry into force of ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 and its comprehensive implementation, this proposal aims to modify the provisions on fishing seasons in Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 in order to ensure effective conservation of the bluefin tunastock. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. Member States concerned by this fishery (Cyprus, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Malta and Portugal) were consulted on 11th December 2012 on the need to clarify the dates of the fishing season, and are agreed on the modifications to the dates of the fishing season. LEGAL BASIS : Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union CONTENT : this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 to reflect ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 regarding fishing seasons. Fishing seasons : bluefin tuna fishing will be permitted in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean: · by large-scale pelagic long line catching vessels over 24 m during the period from 1 January to 31 May with the exception of the area delimited by West of 10◦W and North of 42◦N, where such fishing shall be permitted from 1 August to 31 January; · by purse seine fishing during the period from 26 May to 24 June; · by bait boats and trolling boats during the period from 1 July to 31 October; · by pelagic trawlers in the eastern Atlantic during the period from 16 June to 14 October ; · as recreational and sport fishing from 16 June to 14 October. Fishing for Bluefin tuna by other gears than those mentioned above will be permitted throughout the year. Date of application: this amendment will apply with retroactive effect from 1 January 2013. This will allow Member States properly to define their fishing capacity and inspection plans which are linked to the fishing seasons and ensure legal certainty. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community. Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directive 2008/95/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an increasingly competitive environment, the growing number of trade mark applications at both national and EU levels, and the growing number of trade mark users demonstrates the crucial role of trade marks in terms of market success and commercial value. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date. In its ‘ Small Business Act ’ of 2008, the Commission pledged to make the Community trademark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, in its 2008 Communication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe the Commission underlined its commitment to effective and efficient trademark protection and to a trademark system of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trademark system in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) and National Offices. Lastly, in its 2011 Intellectual Property Rights Strategy for Europe, the Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a view to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it more effective, efficient and consistent overall. The Council has also called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment carried out for both the review of the Regulation and of the Directive identified two main problems: (i) the divergent provisions of the existing regulatory framework, and (ii) the low level of cooperation between trade mark offices in the Union. Four options were envisaged. ·  Option 1 : no further approximation of trade mark laws and procedures; ·  Option 2 : Partial expansion of the approximation of national laws and their consistency with the Community trade mark system; ·  Option 3 : full approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures; ·  Option 4 : a single trademark rulebook, which would replace Member States' trade mark laws in their entirety, by setting uniform rules across the Union. The impact assessment concluded that option 2 would be proportionate and would best serve to achieve the objectives pursued. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the main common objective of this proposal for recasting and of the parallel proposal for the amendment of the Regulation is to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and efficient for businesses in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and legal security. Specifically, the initiative to recast the Directive is driven by the following objectives: 1) Modernising and improving the existing provisions of the Directive. This will be achieved by amending outdated provisions, increasing legal certainty and clarifying trade mark rights in terms of their scope and limitations: ·  the proposed new definition does not restrict the permissible means of representation to graphic or visual representation but leaves the door open to register matter that can be represented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees; ·  the proposal makes it clear that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier rights; ·  it is clarified that in cases of both double identity and similarity, it is only the origin function which matters; ·  in accordance with the rulings of the Court of Justice, it is appropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met; ·  the trade mark owner may prevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC; ·  it is made clear that the importing of goods into the Union is also prohibited where it is only the consignor who acts for commercial purposes; ·  bearing in mind the outcome of the Philips/Nokia judgment, the proposal entitles right holders to stop third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing an unauthorised trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the Union, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation; ·  there are provisions allowing proceedings against the distribution and sale of labels and packaging and similar items which may subsequently be combined with illicit products. 2) Achieve greater approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures with the aim of making them more consistent with the Community trade mark system, by (a) adding further substantive rules and (b) introducing principal procedural rules into the Directive in accordance with provisions contained in the Regulation. In this regard, it is proposed, inter alia: ·  to insert provisions relating to geographical indications, traditional terms for wine and traditional specialities guaranteed in the Directive; ·  to ensure that, in all Member States, national trade marks with reputation enjoy the same level of protection as that afforded to Community trade marks; ·  to complement the Directive with a corresponding body of rules addressing trade marks as objects of property as contained in the Regulation; ·  to provide for a set of specific provisions for the registration and protection of collective marks. 3) Facilitate cooperation between the offices of the Member States and OHIM for the purpose of promoting convergence of practices and the development of common tools, by putting in place a legal basis for this cooperation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: First subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: a number of acts which were adopted over the last decades have exhausted all their effects, but remain technically in force. They have become obsolete because of their temporary character or because their content has been taken up by successive acts. Several measures linked to the accession of new Member States provided for transitory measures following directly the time of their accession and by now have become obsolete. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in their inter-institutional agreement on better law making that Community law should be updated and condensed by repealing acts which are no longer applied. Acts which have no continued relevance should be removed from the 'acquis communautaire', in order to improve transparency and certainty of Union law. The Commission has carried out several exercises to remove obsolete legislation from the acquis, partly trough the traditional repeal procedure, partly by declaring the relevant Commission acts obsolete. The Commission also identified a number of Council acts related to the Common Agricultural Policy, which are based upon Article 42 and 43 of the Treaty (former Articles 36 and 37) and two Acts of Accession, which have exhausted all practical effects, but are formally still in force. It is not within the Commission's powers to declare obsolete acts which were adopted by the Council.

8000EP9,"""""Digital Green Certificate - Union citizens""""",0.661,0.94,0.757,0.438,0.491,0.954,0.812,0.317,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates on vaccination, testing and recovery to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic (Digital Green Certificate). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. To ensure a well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement, the Council adopted, on 13 October 2020, Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Member States have launched or plan to launch initiatives to issue vaccination certificates. However, for these to be used effectively in a cross-border context when citizens exercise their free movement rights, such certificates need to be fully interoperable, secure and verifiable. A commonly agreed approach is required among Member States on the content, format, principles and technical standards of such certificates. In their declaration adopted following the informal video conferences on 25-26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for further work on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission is working with Member States in the e-Health network, a voluntary network of national e-Health authorities, to prepare for the interoperability of these certificates. Work is also underway to develop a common harmonised data set for COVID-19 test result certificates. CONTENT: based on the technical work done so far, the proposed Regulation establishes the digital green certificate, which is a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital green certificate The interoperable digital green certificate should allow for the issuance, cross-border verification and acceptance of any of the following certificates: (i) vaccination certificates, (ii) certificates for screening tests (NAAT/RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) and (iii) certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. Member States should issue the certificates in a digital and/or paper-based format. Certificates issued by Member States should contain an interoperable barcode to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The certificates should be available free of charge and in the official language(s) of the issuing Member State as well as in English. Trust framework The Commission and the Member States should establish a digital trust framework infrastructure allowing for the secure issuance and verification of certificates and ensuring, as far as possible, interoperability with internationally established technology systems. The proposal also provides for the acceptance of secure and verifiable certificates issued by third countries to EU citizens and their family members according to an international standard that is interoperable with the trust framework established by the Regulation and that will contain the necessary personal data, following an implementing decision by the Commission. Issuance, content and acceptance of certificates The proposal provides details on the issuance, content and acceptance of the vaccination certificate, the test certificate and the certificate of recovery. The certificates would include a limited set of essential information such as name, date of birth, date of issue, relevant information on the vaccine administered/tested/recovery and a unique certificate identifier. The digital green certificate would be valid in all EU Member States and open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The possession of a ‘digital green certificate’, in particular a vaccination certificate, should not be a precondition for the exercise of free movement. In particular, the proposed Regulation cannot be interpreted as establishing an obligation or right to be vaccinated. Notification The proposal establishes a notification procedure to ensure that the other Member States and the Commission are informed of the restrictions on the right to free movement made necessary by the pandemic. Data protection The certificates should contain only such personal data as is necessary. Given that the personal data includes sensitive medical data, a very high level of data protection should be ensured and data minimisation principles should be preserved. In particular, the ‘Digital Green Certificate’ framework should not require the setting up and maintenance of a database at EU level but should allow for the decentralised verification of digitally signed interoperable certificates. Temporary measure The proposal foresees that the measures should be suspended once the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched the Doha Round of trade negotiations, known as the Doha Development Agenda in November 2001. The negotiations on trade facilitation were launched in July 2004, based on a commitment to clarify and improve several articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994): such as those concerning: (i) freedom of transit); (ii) fees and formalities connected with importation and exportation); (iii) publication and administration of trade regulations. Moreover, the mandate referred to provisions for effective cooperation between customs or any other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues. The 9th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Bali on 3-6 December 2013 adopted the Ministerial Decision on Trade Facilitation, which concluded negotiations on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation subject to the legal review of the text. At its meeting on 26 November 2014, the WTO's General Council adopted the Protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and opened it for acceptance by the WTO Members. The Protocol should now be concluded on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to conclude the protocol amending the Marrakesh agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. The protocol includes the Agreement on Trade facilitation and the commitments will become an integral part of the Agreement. The Agreement contains a set of measures designed to improve the cross-border movement of goods by improving transparency, streamlining customs procedures and eliminating red tape. For developing countries, it also contains innovative flexibilities which may become standard in future rules type agreements. The Agreement is divided into two sections: The OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators estimate that comprehensive implementation of all measures of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation would reduce total trade costs by 10% in developed countries and by 13-15.5% in developing countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States – with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom – and also by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Regulation is part of the EU’s common visa policy for short stays of 90 days in any 180-day period. Kosovo is currently listed in Annex I, Part 2 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 , i.e. among those entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as states by at least one Member State. Persons from those entities are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. Since launching the visa dialogue in January 2012, the Commission has presented regular reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on its assessment of Kosovo’s fulfilment of the requirements of the roadmap which identified all the legislation and other measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. In its last report, the Commission set out recommendations corresponding to outstanding requirements of the visa roadmap, including four key priorities. It noted the border/boundary delineation agreement with Montenegro should be ratified by Kosovo before visa free status is granted to persons from Kosovo. In its latest report, the Commission observed that Kosovo had taken important steps towards fulfilling the requirement of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and fulfilled sufficient elements of building up its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Based on this assessment and given the outcome of the continuous monitoring and reporting that had been carried out since the launch of the visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo, the Commission confirms that Kosovo has met the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap on the understanding that by the day of the adoption of this proposal by the European Parliament and the Council, Kosovo will have ratified the border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. CONTENT: taking account of all the criteria which should be considered when determining on a case-by-case basis the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (as introduced by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014), the Commission has decided to present a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Kosovo from Annex I, Part 2 (visa-required list) to Annex II, Part 4 (visa-free list). A footnote will be added specifying that the visa exemption will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents (Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004). Territorial provisions : the proposed regulation will constitute a development of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and shall not be bound by it or subject to its application. The amended Regulation will be directly applicable from the date of its entry into force and will be implemented immediately by Member States. No implementation plan is necessary. The Commission will continue to actively monitor Kosovo’s process of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and the development of its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. (*) This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current framework for trade relations between the EU and Tunisia is provided by the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, signed in 1995. The Agreement entered into force in 1998 and laid the foundation for the establishment of a Free Trade Area, including a progressive liberalisation on agriculture. Tunisia and the EU are on the verge of engaging in negotiations for establishing a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) that will notably provide for further liberalisation of trade in agriculture. The terrorist attack of 26 June 2015 in Sousse prompted a reaction from the EU on the need to further assist Tunisia in its political and economic transition, in a concrete and targeted manner, through actions that can be effective in the short-term. On 20 July 2015, the Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation in Tunisia and concrete measures which the EU could take to support it. It is within this context that the following trade measures are proposed. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to offer a temporary, unilateral duty free tariff rate quota of 35 000 tons annually for Tunisia's exports of olive oil to the Union, under the form of autonomous trade measure. Such quota will be made available for a period of two years, from 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2017. This additional volume will be opened once the existing duty free tariff rate quota of 56 700 tonnes, enshrined in the Agreement, is exhausted. Olive oil is Tunisia’s main agricultural export to the EU, and the olive oil industry is an important part of the country’s economy, providing direct and indirect employment to more than one million people and representing one-fifth of the country’s total agricultural employment. Rule of origin : the proposed autonomous trade measures should be subject to compliance by Tunisia with the Union’s relevant rules regarding the origin of products and the procedures related thereto, as well as to Tunisia’s effective administrative cooperation with the Union. Powers shall be conferred on the Commission as regards the respect of the conditions subject to which the preferential arrangements are provided for. Temporary suspension : where the Commission finds that there is sufficient evidence of a failure by Tunisia to comply with the conditions set out in the Regulation, it may adopt an implementing act suspending in whole or in part the preferential arrangements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the measures might lead to a modest net increase on imports as most of the quota increase will probably replace current inward processing trade (about 50 000 tonnes of olive oil a year under the Inward Processing regime), resulting in a reduction of the imports under this regime. The budgetary implications (of duty collections) cannot be quantified precisely at present, but are assumed to be insignificant."

Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As of 11 March 2022, over 310 000 refugees had entered the Republic of Moldova from Ukraine following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In just the first two weeks of the war, more than two million refugees – around 4% of Ukraine’s population – mainly fled westward from the encroaching Russian forces. Moldovan border management authorities are thus now facing the twin challenges of regulating the influx and subsequent outflow of potentially hundreds of thousands of refugees, including monitoring the smuggling of weapons. Furthermore, some 12% of the territory of the country is not under the control of Moldovan authorities, including a large portion of Moldova’s border with Ukraine. On 14 March 2022, the Council adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Moldova as regards actions by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency on the territory of Moldova. On 17 March 2021, on the basis of a written procedure, delegations confirmed their agreement on the proposal for a Council Decision on the signature of the Status Agreement with Moldova. The Agreement was signed the same day, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The aim of the agreement is to allow the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to deploy border management teams from the permanent contingent to Moldova. The agreement regulates all aspects necessary for the deployment of the Border Management Teams from the European Border and Coast Guard Standing Corps in the Republic of Moldova, where the members of the teams may exercise executive powers. A status agreement will allow Frontex to assist Moldova in border management, by deploying teams capable of assisting the Moldovan authorities in tasks such as registration and border checks."

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual use items requires dual-use items (including software and technology) to be subject to effective control when they are exported from or transit through the Union, or are delivered to a third country as a result of brokering services provided by a broker resident or established in the Union. In order to enable Member States and the European Union to comply with their international commitments, Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes the common list of dual use items and technology referred to in Article 3 of that Regulation, which implements internationally agreed dual-use controls. These commitments were taken within the context of participation in the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Technological progress in today's world means that there is a need to update regularly the list of controlled items. The last update of Annex I of the Regulation occurred on the occasion of the adoption of the Regulation on 5 May 2009. Since this time, all of the international export control regimes have taken decisions to modify and update their control lists. Consequently, there is a need to make modifications to Annex I. Details of the modifications to the definitions and the general note and of modifications to items in categories 1-9 are given in the proposal. For the purpose of clarity and ease of use of Annex I, the Commission is proposing to replace the entire Annex I with a new text incorporating the changes discussed.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values. The proposed new Horizon Europe programme builds on the success of the previous framework programme, Horizon 2020. Horizon 2020 has already attracted the world’s best research institutions and researchers, supported 340 000 researchers, and developed Europe’s skilled human capital. Scientific publications from Horizon 2020 are world class and have contributed to major scientific breakthroughs. Specifically, Horizon Europe shall strengthen the EU’s scientific and technological bases in order to help tackle the major global challenges of our time and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At the same time, the programme shall boost the Union’s competitiveness and help deliver on the Union’s strategic priorities. According to the Commission, the new programme is expected to increase GDP on average by 0.08% to 0.19% over 25 years and directly generate an estimated gain of up to 100 000 jobs in R&I activities in the ‘investment phase’ (2021-2027). The economic activity generated by the Programme is expected to foster an indirect gain of up to 200 000 jobs over 2027-2036, of which 40% will be highly skilled. The proposal is in line with the headline target of investing 3% of the EU’s GDP on research and development. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Horizon Europe research and innovation framework programme for the period 2021-2027 and lays down the rules for participation and dissemination of results applicable to indirect actions carried out under the programme. The programme’s general objective is to deliver scientific, economic and societal impact from the Union’s investments in research and innovation in order to: (i) strengthen the scientific and technological bases of the Union and foster its competitiveness, including in its industry; (ii) to deliver on the Union strategic priorities; (iii) contribute to tackling global challenges, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ has a more ‘top down’ directed approach addressing Union and global policy and competitiveness challenges and opportunities. These are integrated into five clusters (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. Alongside the regular calls for proposals, a limited set of highly visible missions shall be introduced. These will be designed in the context of a strategic planning process. Missions, with ambitious but time-bound and achievable goals, should speak to the public and engage it where relevant. They will be co-designed with Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ shall essentially focus on scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation by establishing a European Innovation Council, support the enhancement of European ecosystems of innovation and continued support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The European Innovation Council shall offer a one-stop-shop to high-potential innovators. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology shall complement the European Innovation Council by promoting sustainable innovation ecosystems and developing entrepreneurial and innovation skills in priority areas through its knowledge and innovation communities. The three pillars shall be underpinned by activities to strengthening the European Research Area, specifically: sharing excellence to fully exploit the potential in less R&I performing countries. Cross-cutting elements : the Commission proposes to: significantly strengthen international cooperation by extending association agreements to include countries with excellent science, technology and innovation capacities; make the principle of open science the modus operandi of the new programme by requiring open access to publications and data which shall accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation; rationalise the current plethora of European partnerships so that they can continue in simplified forms that are open to all (such as academia, industry, Member States, and philanthropic foundations). These partnerships shall be designed on the basis of Union added value, transparency, openness, impact, leverage effect; enhance synergies with other EU programmes to promote faster dissemination and uptake of research and innovation results. Rules for participation and dissemination : these shall have the following new features: (i) continuation of the principle of a single set of rules for participation and dissemination through further improvements; (ii) maintenance of ‘Horizon 2020’ funding rates; (iii) simplification of the cost reimbursement scheme, in particular the actual costs scheme for personnel costs; (vi) increased emphasis on exploitation and dissemination of results, particularly in the Union; (vi) communication by beneficiaries of Union funds, including to the public and the media. For Horizon Europe, the award criteria shall be excellence; impact; and quality and efficiency of the implementation. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the Framework Programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices. The indicative distribution of this amount shall be: EUR 25.80 billion for pillar I ‘Open Science’; EUR 52.70 billion for Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’; EUR 13.50 billion for pillar III ‘Open innovation’; EUR 2.10 billion for the part ‘Strengthening the European Research Area’."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement represented a significant change in transatlantic aviation relations, providing broad new commercial freedoms for airlines and a comprehensive framework for regulatory cooperation with the United States on a wide range of issues. The 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement created substantial benefits for airlines, airports and air transport users in Europe. However, the EU was seeking additional investment and market access opportunities. Therefore, Article 21 of the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement established a non-exhaustive list of 'items of priority interest' for the second stage negotiations, including additional investment and market access opportunities, as well as environmental issues. After eight rounds of second stage negotiations, agreement was reached on 25 March 2010 on a draft Protocol to Amend the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement. The Protocol aims at: launching a process towards additional foreign investment opportunities in the airline industry, further opening market access, including further access by EU airlines to US Government-financed air transportation, and further strengthening the regulatory cooperation in all fields of aviation policy, particularly on addressing the environmental impact of aviation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Protocol further increases the benefits for consumers, airlines, labour, and communities in the Union: (1) in a study carried out for the Commission, the economic benefits of a fully Open Aviation Area between the EU and the United States have been estimated at several billion Euros per year; (2) another study estimates that further regulatory convergence in the field of air transport could significantly reduce costs for the industry. The same study concluded that the second stage negotiations have the potential to change the structure of the market in the EU and in the US, increasing profitability in the airline industry; (3) the inclusion of an article on the social dimension ensures that the further market opening will be accompanied by high labour standards and that labour-related rights will not be undermined by the new opportunities created by the Protocol; (4) lastly, the Protocol includes firm commitments from both Parties to limit or reduce the impact of international aviation on the environment. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2) and (5), as well Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reasons: (i) an amendment of an international treaty at Union level can only be done at Union level; (ii) the objectives of the Protocol can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. CONTENT: the Protocol amends the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement with the following provisions: a legal obligation to reciprocally recognise the regulatory determinations of the other Party with regard to airline fitness and citizenship; an enhanced cooperation to limit the impact of international aviation on the environment. The cooperation on addressing the environmental impacts of international aviation will include the areas of research and development, air traffic management innovation, coordination in international fora; an explicit recognition of the importance of the social dimension and the benefits of high labour standards as well as an enhanced cooperation on the social effects of the agreement; a strengthened role of the Joint Committee, enabling it to address incompatible regulatory approaches, allow for reciprocal recognition of decision-making, and promote cooperation across a number of additional fields, including air traffic management, facilitation, safety and cooperation with other countries; a process towards further market access and investment opportunities. Both sides commit to continuing to remove market access barriers. The Joint Committee will regularly review progress in that respect. Both sides will establish a process of cooperation in the Joint Committee towards the shared goal of removing market access barriers; further access of EU airlines to air transport funded by the US Government that is restricted currently to US airlines (""Fly America""). EU airlines will be able to sell air transportation to contractors of the US Government on any route, with exception of transport financed by the US Department of Defence. The Protocol is accompanied by a Memorandum of Consultations that includes additional new elements, in order to further enhance the existing cooperation in the areas of aviation security, competition policy, and the joint efforts to address the environmental impact of international aviation.

5657EP7,"""""Conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of seasonal employment""""",0.0,0.733,0.825,0.129,0.152,0.855,0.774,0.571,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to introduce a special procedure for third-country nationals applying to reside in the EU for seasonal employment, and to define the rights of seasonal workers. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: EU economies face a structural need for seasonal work for which labour from within the EU is expected to become less and less available. As regards future skills shortages, traditional sectors will continue to play an important role and the structural need for low-skilled and low-qualified workers is likely to continue expanding. It should also be pointed out that there is a more permanent need for unskilled labour within the EU. It is expected to be increasingly difficult to fill these gaps with EU national workers, primarily owing to the fact that these workers consider seasonal work unattractive. Further, there is significant evidence that certain third-country seasonal workers face exploitation and sub-standard working conditions which may threaten their health and safety. Lastly, sectors of the economy that are characterised by a strong presence of seasonal workers - most notably agriculture, horticulture and tourism - are repeatedly identified as the sectors most prone to work undertaken by third-country nationals who are staying illegally. The proposal is part of a comprehensive package of measures, proposed in the Policy Plan on Legal Migration of 2005 and further endorsed by the Stockholm Programme, adopted by the European Council in December 2009. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the following options were considered: Option 1 - Status quo. Current developments in Member States and at EU level would continue within the existing legal framework. Employers will be under certain obligations resulting from the 2009 Directive on employer sanctions as regards notifications to authorities and penalties in the case of illegal employment. The effect of this option would be limited. Option 2 - Directive on entry and residence conditions of seasonal workers and rights . Common rules would be established, including the definition of seasonal work, and admission criteria. This would help to establish a common legal framework applicable to all employers in the EU and to prevent exploitation. However, seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex procedures for entry. Option 3 - Directive laying down common admission procedures . In addition to option 2, a single work and residence permit for third-country seasonal workers would be introduced, to be issued in a single procedure. Provisions would be made for facilitating re-entry of a seasonal worker in subsequent seasons. Hiring procedures would be more efficient, and a more predictable workforce would be available for EU employers. Option 4 - Directive on measures to ensure effective return . Measures would include limitation of the length of stay, and an explicit obligation to return at the end of the period. Overstaying of seasonal workers would be prevented to some extent. Effects on the functioning of the EU labour market would be marginal. Seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex entry procedures. Option 5 - Communication, coordination and cooperation among Member States . No new legislation would be introduced, but complementary and supporting activities would be undertaken with a view to approximating Member States’ practices. Effects would be limited, as the measures would not be binding; potential seasonal workers and their prospective employers would continue to face an array of different rules for admission and different rights would be granted to seasonal workers during their residence. The preferred option is a combination of options 2, 3 and 4. Common admission standards with simplified entry procedures and the prospect of returning in a subsequent season (options 2 and 3) will provide for flexible admission to endow the EU labour market with the necessary resources. Elements from option 4 should help ensure the return of the seasonal worker and thus prevent overstaying. LEGAL BASE: Article 79(2)(a) and (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal establishes a fast-track procedure for the admission of third-country seasonal workers, based on a common definition and common criteria, in particular the existence of a work contract or a binding job offer that specifies a salary equal to or above a minimum level. Seasonal workers will be issued with a residence permit allowing them to work for a specified maximum period per calendar year. Provision is also made for facilitating the re-entry of a seasonal worker in a subsequent season. In order to prevent exploitation and protect the safety and health of third-country seasonal workers, legal provisions applying to working conditions are clearly defined. Also, employers are required to provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have appropriate accommodation during his/her stay and that provision is made for facilitation of complaints. To prevent overstaying of third-country seasonal workers, a maximum duration of stay per calendar year is laid down as well as the explicit obligation to return after that period; there is no possibility of status change. The main provisions are as follows: Chapter I: General provisions Purpose :the purpose of the proposal is to introduce a special procedure for the entry and residence of third-country nationals applying to reside in the EU for seasonal employment, and to define the rights of seasonal workers. Scope : the provisions only apply to third-country nationals who reside outside the territory of the Member States. There is no provision for applications for employment as seasonal workers from within a Member State. The proposal does not apply to third-country nationals posted by undertakings established in a Member State in the framework of a provision of services in accordance with Directive 96/71/EC. Definitions : the notion of seasonal work is distinguished from regular, permanent work in particular by higher workforce requirements linked to an event or pattern of events, such as the planting or harvesting period in agriculture, or the holiday period in tourism including events, festivals, biennales or long term exhibitions in culture. Member States may determine specific sectors of the economy that meet the criteria for seasonal work. More favourable provisions : the proposal allows Member States to grant more favourable conditions only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern the procedural safeguards, the level of rights granted to seasonal workers, as well as provisions relating to accommodation and facilitation of complaints. Chapter II: Admission criteria Criteria for admission : the proposal sets out the criteria that a third-country national seasonal worker and his/her employer must fulfil. As the admission is demand-driven, a work contract or a binding job offer must be presented. They should specify a level of remuneration in order to allow the competent authorities to assess whether the proposed remuneration is comparable to that paid for the respective activity in the Member State concerned. This is vital in order to avoid an unfair advantage for the employer and exploitative working conditions for the seasonal worker. The work contract must also specify the working hours per week or month. ensure that employers only request third-country seasonal workers in case of real economic need (sufficient employment capacities); serve as a guarantee of a certain, fixed level of remuneration for the seasonal workers, and, when applicable, other relevant working conditions such as insurances; enable efficient control by the competent authorities before admission. The application must also include evidence that the respective seasonal worker will benefit from appropriate accommodation. Grounds for refusal : the proposal does not create a right to admission. These provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusal as well as for withdrawal and non-renewal, including non-fulfilment of the admission criteria, the existence of quotas and the possibility for Member States to carry out a labour market test. The principle of EU preference, as expressed in the relevant provisions of the Acts of Accession of 2003 and 2005, constitutes EU primary law, and therefore the Directive must be applied in conformity with the Acts of Accession by those Member States that still make use of the transitional arrangements. Chapter III: Procedure and permit Access to information : Member States are required to ensure that the relevant information about conditions of entry and residence, including the rights granted to third-country seasonal workers, and about all the documentary evidence necessary for lodging the application are available to prospective third-country seasonal workers and their employers. Applications : Member States have to determine whether applications are to be lodged by the third-country national or by his or her prospective employer. They are also required to designate a competent authority to receive the application and issue the permit. This designation is without prejudice to the role and responsibilities of other national authorities with regard to the examination of and decision on the application. Furthermore, the designation to receive and issue the permit should not prevent Member States from appointing other authorities with which the third-country national or his/her prospective employer can lodge the application (e.g. consular offices) and which have the authority to issue the permit. The application to reside and work as a seasonal worker must be submitted in a single application procedure. Seasonal worker permit : third-country nationals for whom a positive decision has been taken by the Member State concerned must receive a seasonal worker permit. The residence permit with the indication ‘seasonal worker’ must allow both the residence and the exercise of the specific seasonal work authorised, without an additional permit, in particular a work permit, being necessary. Accordingly, for periods of stay below three months, Member States must issue a visa that will also entitle the seasonal worker to exercise the specific employment activity for which he/she was admitted. Duration of stay : the maximum period of stay is set at six months in any calendar year. Such strict limitation of the duration of stay should contribute to ensuring that third-country national workers admitted under the Directive are actually employed for work that is genuinely seasonal and not for regular work. Explicit provision is made that within the maximum duration of stay an extension of the contract or a change of employer for seasonal work is possible. This is important because seasonal workers who are tied to a single employer may face the risk of abuse. Also, the possibility of extending the stay within the specified period of time may reduce the risk of overstaying. Facilitation of re-entry : this provision is intended to promote circular migration of third-country national seasonal workers, that is, their movement between a third country and the EU for temporary stay and work in the latter. This kind of migration will potentially benefit the country of origin, the EU host country and the seasonal worker him/herself. Accordingly, Member States have the choice of either issuing multi-seasonal permits or applying a facilitated procedure. Multi-seasonal permits cover up to three seasons and are thus appropriate for sectors where the labour market needs remain stable over a period of time. A third-country national who did not comply with the obligations linked to a previous stay as a seasonal worker is to be excluded from admission as a seasonal worker for one or more years. Sanctions : an employer who has not fulfilled obligations resulting from the work contract must be subjected to sanctions and excluded from the possibility to apply for seasonal workers for at least one year. Procedure : a fast-track procedure (30 days) is provided for examining applications. Procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decision. Accommodation: employers of seasonal workers must provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have accommodation ensuring an adequate standard of living. This covers cases where the employer is to provide accommodation and where accommodation is to be provided by a third party. Chapter IV: Rights Rights : a seasonal worker permit entitles its holder to enter and reside on the territory of the Member State which has issued the permit and to exercise the employment activity authorised by the permit. The text defines the working conditions, including pay, dismissal and health and safety requirements at the workplace applicable to seasonal workers in order to ensure legal certainty. It also grants rights to third-country seasonal workers by determining fields where equal treatment with own nationals should be ensured in the form of a minimum requirement without prejudice to the right of Member States to adopt or maintain provisions which are more favourable. Accordingly, equal treatment applies in respect of freedom of association and affiliation and membership of an organisation representing workers. Equal treatment : equal treatment also applies to social security and covers the benefits defined in Regulation (EC) No 883/04 on the coordination of social security systems. Such provisions are intended to establish common rules within the EU; to recognise that third-country national seasonal workers legally working in a Member State contribute to the European economy through their tax payments; and to serve as a safeguard to reduce unfair competition between own nationals and third-country nationals that may result from possible exploitation of the latter. Complaints: complaints mechanisms should be put in place, open not only to third-country seasonal workers, but also to designated third parties. Evidence suggests that seasonal workers are often either not aware of the existence of such mechanisms or they are hesitant to use them in their own name, as they are afraid of the consequences in terms of future employment possibilities. Chapter V: Final provisions : this chapter regulates the obligations of Member States concerning sharing the relevant statistical data and the information resulting from transposition of the Directive. It also specifies the reporting obligations of the European Commission and stipulates the date on which the Directive enters into force. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households’ access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Bonn Agreement aims to combat pollution in the North Sea Area and safeguard coastal areas from maritime disasters and chronic pollution from ships and offshore installations. The European Union is a Contracting Party to the Agreement. Amendments were made to the agreement in 1989. These amendments entered into force on 1 April 1994. On 7 October 2019, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an amendment to extend the scope of the Bonn Agreement with a view to improving cooperation on surveillance with regard to the requirements of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the ""MARPOL Convention"") and the extension to the Kingdom of Spain under Article 20 of the Agreement. The amendments are now submitted for conclusion by the Union. CONTENT: the proposed Decision provides that the Council authorises the Commission to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the envisaged amendments to the Bonn Agreement relating to the extension of the material scope of the Agreement as regards Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention and the accession of the Kingdom of Spain to the Agreement. The amendments envisaged are the following: The ‘MARPOL amendment’ – amending the substantive scope of the Agreement This amendment seeks to improve cooperation and coordination between the Contracting Parties in combating unlawful air emissions caused by shipping in order to limit the negative consequences of the combustion of marine fuels with high sulphur or nitrogen content for human health, biodiversity and the entire marine environment. The adoption of the decision to conclude the amendment on the extension of the mandate of the Bonn Agreement in relation to Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention would improve joint surveillance, monitoring and reporting of ship emissions in the North Sea area. The ‘Spain amendment’ – amending the geographical scope of the Agreement This amendment extends the geographical scope of the Agreement to cover the area between the zone of joint responsibility of France and the United Kingdom and the new zone of responsibility of Spain in order to close any gaps between the old boundary of the Bonn Agreement and the new zone of responsibility of Spain. France has accepted the introduction of a new zone of responsibility of France."
10204EP8,"""""Adapting a number of legal acts in the area of Justice providing for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to Article 290 TFEU""""",0.8,0.792,0.96,0.667,0.096,0.821,0.796,0.731,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to adapt a number of legal acts in the area of justice to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Article 290, powers delegated to the Commission). LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty of Lisbon introduced a distinction between the following: powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), as referred to in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning pf the EU; and powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts) as referred to in Article 291 of the Treaty. The measures which may be covered by delegations of powers correspond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC. This procedure still appears in the basic acts covered by this proposal and continues to apply in those acts until they are formally amended and adapted to the Lisbon Treaty. The Commission made three horizontal alignment legislative proposals in 2013 (Omnibus I, Omnibus II and Omnibus III). The European Parliament adopted its legislative resolutions on 25 February 2014, broadly agreeing with the proposals by the Commission. The Council, however, did not support the Commission proposals, due to the absence of stronger guarantees that Member State experts would be systematically consulted in the preparation of delegated acts. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission subsequently agreed on a new framework for delegated acts in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016 (IAA) and acknowledged the need to align all existing legislation to the legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. In particular, they agreed on the need to give high priority to the prompt alignment of all basic acts that still refer to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. CONTENT: the proposal aligns three basic acts to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, these acts being: Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters; Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims; Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation No 1348/2000. The alignment clauses reflect the following points in the IAA: they now provide for a clear commitment to a systematic consultation of experts from the Member States in the preparation of delegated acts. This fulfils a key condition for a successful second attempt to align the old regulatory procedure with scrutiny provisions to the Lisbon Treaty. This commitment is now explicitly included in the new standard clauses; they recognise the important role of early cooperation and exchange of views with the European Parliament in relation to delegated acts. The European Parliament must receive all documents at the same time as Member State experts, including the draft delegated acts, and the alignment clauses provide for systematic access of European Parliament experts to the meetings of Commission expert groups preparing delegated acts. Accordingly, to each basic act a number of amendments are made, and references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny are deleted. As regards the duration of the empowerment the Commission proposes empowerments with an indeterminate duration, since the legislator has the possibility of revoking an empowerment in all cases and at any time. Acts on which individual legislative proposals have been made in the meantime are not included in the proposal. This concerns two acts in the area of justice: Regulation (EC) No. 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation (EC) No. 861/2007 establishing a European small claims procedure. These have been aligned in the meantime been aligned by Regulation (EU) 2015/2421. This proposal is linked to the proposal on adapting a number of legal acts to Article 290 and 291 of the TFEU."

For the purpose of ensuring the application of this Convention and recommendations adopted by the North East Atlantic Commission (NEAFC), measures concerning control and enforcement relating to fisheries concerned may be adopted. Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 transposes into Union law the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the NEAFC. At its Annual Meetings in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, NEAFC adopted: Recommendation 15:2013 amending the Scheme, concerning the communication of transhipments and of port of landing; Recommendation 9:2014 amending the Scheme, concerning, respectively, the definitions, a number of provisions applying to Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels and the infringement procedures; Recommendation 12:2015 amending Recommendation 9:2014 with respect to Articles 22 and 23 of the Scheme on Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels. These Recommendations were adopted with the full support of the EU in NEAFC. It is in the EU's interest therefore that they be introduced in Union law by means of the proposed regulation. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 in order to incorporate it into Union law amendments to the Scheme as adopted in NEAFC Recommendations 15/2013 and 9/2014 as amended by Recommendation 12/2015 which have become binding for the Contracting Parties to NEAFC and consequently for the EU. The main change, operated by Recommendation 9/2014, is the alignment of the Scheme with the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU, approved by the EU in 2011. Contracting Parties have agreed that this recommendation will enter into force on 1 July 2015. The other change, made through Recommendation 15/2013, clarifies that vessels involved in a transhipment operation in the Regulatory Area as receiving vessel shall communicate the port of landing regardless of whether the landing is to take place in a port inside or outside the Convention Area. Recommendation 12/2015 amended Recommendation 9/2014 with respect to notification procedures on Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels with the aim to adapt them for the switch-over from a paper based system to a modern web-based ICT application, operated by the NEAFC Secretary."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the recommendations presented in February 2009 of a group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009 (COM(2009)0114). The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 (COM(2009)0252) which proposed the establishment of: · a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees into a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), thereby combining the advantages of an overarching European framework for financial supervision with the expertise of local micro-prudential supervisory bodies that are closest to the institutions operating in their jurisdictions; and · a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. To this end, the ESRB would provide an early warning of system-wide risks that may be building up and, where necessary, issue recommendations for action to deal with these risks. On 27 May 2009, the Commission published a Communication on Financial Supervision in the EU, describing in detail how these recommendations could be put into effect, focusing in particular on the establishment of the proposed ESFS and ESRB. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to proposals on: a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanies these proposals, examining the options in more detail (see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: in order to take account of sectoral specificities, three separate Regulations are needed to establish the Authorities for banking, insurance and occupational pensions, and securities. The broad thrust of these proposals is, however, identical. The proposal discusses the common elements and briefly touches upon the differences between the three Regulations. Objectives of the ESAs : these shall be to contribute to: (i) improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular a high, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision, (ii) protecting depositors, investors, policyholders and other beneficiaries, (iii) ensuring the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, (iv) safeguarding the stability of the financial system, and (v) strengthening international supervisory coordination. The ESAs will be Community bodies with a legal personality and a key element of the proposed ESFS. The main decision-making body of each ESA will be its Board of Supervisors, consisting of the heads of the relevant national supervisors as well as the Chairperson of the respective Authority. The Chairperson will preside over meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Management Board. The day-to-day management of each Authority will be in the hands of an Executive Director. Tasks and powers: the ESAs will take on all the tasks of the existing European supervisory committees, but also have significantly increased responsibilities, defined legal powers and greater authority. Develop technical standards : a single EU rule book should be established, applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. To this end, differences in the national transposition of Community law stemming from exceptions, derogations, additions or ambiguities must be removed, so that one harmonised core set of standards can be defined and applied. To contribute to this, the Authorities will develop draft technical standards. These standards constitute an effective instrument to strengthen Level 3 of the Lamfalussy structure, which currently is limited to the adoption of non-binding guidelines. Powers to ensure the consistent application of Community rules : a mechanism will be put in place to address behaviour by national supervisory authorities who are considered to be diverging from the existing Community legislation (including technical standards). The proposal describes the steps of the mechanism. Action in emergency situations : whilst ESAs will have a coordination role between national supervisory authorities, in some emergency situations coordination may not be sufficient, notably when national supervisors alone lack the tools to respond rapidly to an emerging cross-border crisis. The ESAs should thereforehave the power to require national supervisors to take specific action jointly. The determination of a cross-border emergency situation will be left to the Commission. This is subject to the safeguard clause. Settlement of disagreements between national supervisory authorities : a mechanism is proposed to ensure that relevant national supervisory authorities take due account of the interests of other Member States, including within colleges of supervisors. This mechanism consists of three possible steps which are set out in the text. Colleges of supervisors : the latter are central to the EU supervisory system and play an important role in ensuring a balanced flow of information between home and host authorities. The ESAs will contribute to promoting the efficient and consistent functioning of colleges of supervisors and may participate as observers in colleges of supervisors and receive all relevant information shared between the members of the college. Common supervisory culture: the ESAs shall play an active role in building a common European supervisory culture and ensuring uniform procedures and consistent supervisory practices throughout the Community. The common supervisory culture may increasingly create opportunities for supervisors to delegate certain tasks to one another. The ESAs shall periodically conduct peer review analysis of national supervisory authorities. Assessment of market developments : although the proposed ESRB will be responsible for macro-prudential analysis of the EU financial sector, the ESAs should continue the work of the existing European supervisory committees in this area as: (i) the focus of their analysis is different, i.e., micro-prudential analysis provides a bottom-up analysis, rather than macro-prudential analysis which is top-down, and (ii) their analysis may serve as helpful input into the work carried-out by the ESRB. International role : through these proposals the Commission is responding to the weaknesses identified during the crisis as well as to the G20 call to take action to build a stronger, more globally consistent, regulatory and supervisory system for financial services. The ESAs could serve as helpful contact points for supervisory authorities from third countries. They may enter into administrative arrangements with administrations of third countries and may also assist in preparing equivalence decisions pertaining to supervisory regimes in third countries. They may provide advice to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission or publish opinions, including with respect to the prudential assessments of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Collection of information : at the request of the Authority, supervisory authorities and other public authorities of the Member States shall provide the Authority with all the necessary information to carry out the duties assigned to it by this Regulation. In principle, all information should be transferred to the ESAs by the national supervisory authorities. Relationship with the ESRB: the framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate closely. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB would need a timely flow of micro-prudential information, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities would benefit from the ESRB’s insights on the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more national supervisory authorities. Safeguard: in view of the fact that decisions by the ESAs should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States, a safeguard clause is introduced which ensures that, where a Member State considers that a decision taken under provisions concerning emergency decisions or settlement of disagreements of these Regulations impinges on its fiscal responsibility, it may notify the Authority and the Commission that the national supervisory authority does not intend to implement the Authority's decision, clearly demonstrating how the decision by the Authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities. Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities : a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities will ensure mutual understanding, cooperation and consistent supervisory approaches between the three new ESAs. Board of Appeal : an appeal system will ensure that any person, including national supervisory authorities, may in first instance appeal to a Board of Appeal against a decision by the ESAs to ensure the coherent application of Community rules, action in emergency situations, and the settlement of disagreements. The Board of Appeal shall be a joint body of three ESAs, i.e., it will deal with issues related to banking, insurance and securities. Key differences between the three Regulations : the main differences between the three proposed Regulations concern the objectives of the Authorities, the scope of action, and the definitions, which are adapted to the specificities of the relevant sector and existing Community legislation. Moreover, the European Council concluded that the ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. ESMA would be responsible to register credit rating agencies. ESMA would also be empowered to take supervisory measures such as withdrawing the registration or suspending the use for regulatory purposes of credit ratings. Supervisory powers could include the power to request information and to conduct investigations or on-site inspections. The responsibilities and powers of ESMA with regard to credit rating agencies will be defined in an amendment to the Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies.  BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: For the transformation of the existing European supervisory committees into effective ESAs, enhanced resources are needed - both personnel and budgetary. For the ESMA, the total operational expenditure from the Community budget in commitment and payment appropriations for the years 2011-2013 is EUR 21.158 million. In addition, Member States (national supervisory authorities or ministries of finance) will contribute EUR 31.737 million over the three year period. This gives a total of EUR 52.895 million from 2011 to 2013."
2137EP8,"""""Insurance mediation""""",0.843,0.919,0.88,0.604,0.154,0.94,0.906,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to recast Directive 2002/92/EC on insurance mediation (IMD1) in order to improve policyholder protection in the aftermath of the financial crisis. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/92/EC regulates the point of sale of insurance products so as to ensure the rights of the consumer. The Directive is a minimum harmonisation instrument containing high level principles and has been implemented in the 27 Member States in substantially different ways. The need to review IMD1 was already acknowledged during the implementation check carried out by the Commission in 2005-2008. During the discussions in the European Parliament on Directive 2009/138/EC on the risk-based approach to capitalisation and supervision of insurance undertakings (Solvency II), a specific request was furthermore made to review IMD1. Some Members of the Parliament and some consumer organisations considered that there was a need for improved policyholder protection in the aftermath of the financial crisis and that selling practices for different insurance products could be improved. In order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency, the European Parliament requested that the revision of IMD1 should take into account the ongoing revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). In November 2010, the G20 asked the OECD, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other relevant international organisations to develop common principles in the field of financial services in order to strengthen consumer protection. The current review of IMD1 should be seen in the light of these guidelines and related international initiatives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options discussed in the impact assessment were assessed against different criteria: (i) market integration for market players; (ii) customer protection and confidence; (iii) a level playing field for various market players, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the estimate of the administrative burden on the basis of an external study and industry statistics is that in view of the large number of undertakings affected (about 1 million), the proposal will result in a relatively moderate cost of, on average, about EUR 730 per undertaking. The impact assessment work finished in 2012. The European Commission Impact Assessment Board's recommendations were taken on board especially concerning the impact on SME's. In general, proportional requirements have been introduced to take account of SME's concerns and to respect the principle 'less complex products, less rules'. These intermediaries will be subject to a light touch regime. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a recast directive seeks to improve regulation in the retail insurance market in an efficient manner. It aims at ensuring a level playing field between all participants involved in the selling of insurance products and at strengthening policyholder protection. Most of the issues dealt with by the revision are already covered by the current IMD1 legal framework. In concrete terms, the IMD2 project should achieve the following improvements: ·  expand the scope of application of IMD1 to all distribution channels (e.g. direct writers, car rentals, etc.). The draft directive brings within its scope certain ancillary sellers and after-sales businesses such as loss adjusters and claims handlers; ·  clarify the exercise of the freedom of establishment , of the freedom to provide services, and the powers of supervisory authorities of home and host Member States in this regard; ·  identify, manage and mitigate conflicts of interest; ·  raise the level of harmonisation of administrative sanctions and measures for breach of key provisions of the current Directive; ·  enhance the suitability and objectiveness of advice to consumers; ·  ensure sellers' professional qualifications match the complexity of products sold; ·  simplify and approximate the procedure for cross-border entry to insurance markets across the EU. The proposal differentiates between the different selling channels for insurance products and imposes less burdensome registration and professional qualification requirements on those selling simple insurance products. For example, the sellers of ancillary insurance products of low risk, such as car rentals and travel agents are subject to a simplified declaration procedure instead of registration as insurance intermediaries. The proposal also differentiates between the life insurance products and the general insurance products in respect of the remuneration transparency requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) should play a key role in the implementation of the new EU-wide framework and be granted specific competences in this regard. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to tasks allocated to EIOPA. The total operational expenditure (in commitment appropriations) amounts to EUR 0.844 millions for the period 2014-2016. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Tonga were opened on 19 November 2014 in Brussels. During that meeting the entire draft text could be reviewed and agreement was reached on all its aspects. After a number of subsequent informal exchanges, the agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 29 May 2015 (Tonga) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Tongo on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Tongo when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Tonga may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Tonga to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Tongo remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Tongo to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (revision of Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 on transfer of funds). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Funds Transfers Regulation, based on Special Recommendation VII on wire transfers adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), lays down rules for payment service providers to send information on the payer throughout the payment chain for the purposes of prevention, investigation and detection of money laundering and terrorist financing. Against a background of the changes regarding the nature of money laundering and terrorist financing threats, facilitated by a constant evolution of technology and means at the disposal of criminals, the FATF has undertaken a fundamental review of the international standards, which culminated in the adoption of a new set of Recommendations in February 2012. In parallel with this process, the European Commission has also been undertaking its own review of the EU framework, which demonstrates the need to ensure adjustment to changes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identifies the main problems in the current EU anti-money laundering/combating terrorist financing legislative framework. It examines three scenarios: (i) a base-line scenario (status quo); (ii) an adjustment scenario; and (iii) a full harmonisation scenario. The analysis has demonstrated that the most balanced is the adjustment scenario which entails limited changes to the Funds Transfers Regulation necessary to either (i) align the legislative text to the revised international standards, or (ii) to ensure a sufficient level of consistency between national rules, or (iii) to address the most important shortcomings concerning the new emerging threats. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to revise Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds in ways which improve traceability of payments and ensure that the EU framework remains fully compliant with international standards. In line with new FATF Recommendation No 16 on wire transfers, the proposed changes are aimed at addressing areas where gaps in transparency still remain by imposing the following main requirements: · include information on the payee (the name and account number of the payer, where such an account is used to process the transfer of funds, or a unique transaction identifier where no such account is used for that purpose; · clarify that credit or debit cards, or mobile telephone or any other digital or IT device become subject to the provisions of the Regulation if they are used to transfer funds person to person; · clarify that, in the case of fund transfers outside the EU of a sum below EUR 1 000, a lighter regime of non-verified information on the payer and the payee applies; · impose a requirement to verify the identity of the beneficiary (where not previously identified) for payments originating outside the EU and where the amount is more than EUR 1 000; · impose an obligation to establish risk-based procedures for determining when to execute, reject or suspend a transfer of funds which lacks the required information and to determine appropriate follow-up action; · align the requirements on record keeping with the information with the FATF standards; · reinforce sanctioning powers for competent authorities and require coordination of actions when dealing with cross-border cases; · require publication of sanctions imposed for breaches and the establishment of effective mechanisms to encourage reporting of breaches of the provisions of the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."
7407EP8,"""""Clearing obligation, reporting requirements and risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivatives and trade repositories""""",0.943,0.873,0.9,0.125,0.096,0.761,0.895,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to propose more simple and more efficient rules for OTC derivatives without putting financial stability at risk, and increasing transparency with regard to the OTC derivatives market. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR Regulation) implements in the EU the G20 commitment made in 2009 to increase the stability of the OTC derivatives market. The main objective of EMIR is to reduce systemic risk by increasing the transparency of the OTC derivatives market, through core requirements. They include: (i) central clearing; (ii) margin requirements; (iii) operational risk mitigation requirements; (iv) reporting obligations for derivative contracts; (v) requirements for central counterparties (CCPs); and (vi) requirements for trade repositories. In November 2016, the Commission adopted the EMIR report, which pointed to the need to eliminate disproportionate costs and burdens on small companies and to simplify rules without compromising financial stability. Accordingly, the proposal sets out a series of targeted amendments to the EMIR Regulation, in order to simplify the rules and ensure that the latter are more proportionate. At the same time the proposal maintains all key elements of the framework that have proved to allow achieving the objectives of EMIR. It is related to and consistent with the ongoing initiative to establish a Capital Markets Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment analysis the costs and benefits of areas of EMIR where targeted action could ensure fulfilment of the EMIR objectives in a more proportionate, efficient and effective manner. The analysis shows that it would be possible to obtain a reduction of costs and restrictions, and at the same time, simplify the Regulation. It is estimated that the combined effect of all preferred options, calculated solely for the purpose of the impact assessment, amount to cost reductions ranging from EUR 2.3 billion to EUR 6.9 billion in fixed (one-off) costs and from EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 2.66 billion in operational costs. Overall, businesses, SMEs, and micro-enterprises will, in particular, benefit from (i) reducing regulatory requirements in cases where disproportionate compliance costs appear to outweigh prudential benefits and (ii) improving access to clearing. There should be no significant relevant social and economic cost. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in order to simplify the rules applicable to over the counter derivatives and make them more proportionate in order to reduce costs and regulatory burden weighing on market participants, without putting at risk financial stability. The proposal simplifies reporting requirements for all counterparties. It re-focuses the scope of the clearing obligation for financial counterparties to include some additional relevant market players while exempting the smallest financial counterparties. Specifically the proposal: removes the requirement to report historic transactions, i.e. transactions that were not outstanding on the starting date of the reporting obligation on 12 February 2014; introduces improvements to ensure the quality of reported data for trade repositories; establishes single-sided reporting by the central counterparties for exchange-traded derivatives transactions ('ETDs'); provides that, for transactions other than ETD transactions, the responsibility for reporting transactions between a small non-financial counterparty (i.e. not subject to the clearing obligation) and a financial counterparty should be on the financial counterparty to the trade; exempts intragroup transactions involving any non-financial counterparties from the reporting obligation; provides, with regards to non-financial counterparties, that only non-hedging contracts are counted towards the thresholds triggering the clearing obligation; introduces a new three–year temporary exemption for pension funds from central clearing; increases the upper limit of basic amount of fines for infringements of EMIR requirements by trade repositories; clarifies the interaction between EMIR default management tools and national insolvency laws to ensure the insolvency remoteness of client assets; requires observance of the principle to provide clearing services under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms ('FRAND' principle). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
9253EP8,"""""Justice programme""""",0.014,0.742,0.9,0.312,0.077,0.881,0.874,0.481,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish the justice programme for the period 2021-2027. BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. These programmes have led to real progress in promoting values and implementing the rights that EU legislation grant to people across the Union. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU’s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the justice programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the rights and values programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The programme has the general objective of contributing to the further development of a European area of justice based on the rule of law, on mutual recognition and mutual trust between justice professionals in cross-border proceedings. The programme has three specific objectives: to facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law including by supporting the efforts to improve the effectiveness of national justice systems and the enforcement of decision; to support and promote judicial training, with a view to fostering a common legal, judicial and rule of law culture; to facilitate effective access to justice for all and effective redress, including by electronic means, by promoting efficient civil and criminal procedures and by promoting and supporting the rights of victims of crime as well as the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings. In concrete terms, the programme seeks to enhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of citizens, professionals and stakeholders, through supporting: information and public awareness raising , including support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights, as guaranteed under Union law, and how to enforce them in practice; training and capacity building for legal professionals in order to equip them with the tools to effectively put Union rights and policies into practice; cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through strengthening networks, i.e. Union-wide organisations to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in this area, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe and cross-border cooperation on enforcement, for example establishing missing child alert systems, coordination of operational and cross-border anti-drug cooperation. The Commission shall ensure the European added value of all actions and activities carried out under the programme, their complementarity with Member States' activities and their compatibility with other Union activities. It shall set establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. Participation is open to all legal entities legally established in a Member State or in a participating non EU country, with no further restrictions on access to the programme. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 305 million for the period 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: at present, systems for the recovery of aviation security costs are regulated at national level and are not always transparent to the users.

This proposal sets common principles for the levying of security charges at Community airports and applies to any airport located in a territory subject to the provisions of the Treaty. However, it does not apply to the charges collected for the remuneration of en-route and terminal air navigation services in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1794/2006, or to the charges collected for the remuneration of ground-handling services referred to in the Annex to Council Directive 96/67/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers four policy options: Option 1 : No EU action; Option 2 : Self-regulation. Option 3 : EU Directive on non-discrimination, transparency, cost-relatedness and possibility to appeal; Option 4 : Full state funding of airport security. Options 1 and 2 do not attain the objectives, while options 3 and 4 effectively address the concerns of discriminatory and excessive security charges. Option 4, however, discourages more efficient aviation security services because there are no incentives for the security providers to control costs. The increased administrative burden of option 3 is negligible because the same authority as established by the Directive on airport charges can be used. Consequently, option 3 offers the most efficient overall solution. CONTENT: the proposal defines a number of basic principles to be respected by airport operators when they determine their security charges. These are: Non-discrimination : aviation security charging systems should not discriminate between carriers or passengers. Consultation and remedy : the airport managing body and the air carriers serving the airport, or their representative organisations, must engage in a dialogue on the security charging system applicable at an airport not only when such system is modified but also when the levels of the security charges are being established. The aim of this requirement is that the two parties exchange views on a regular basis on the levels of the charges, as well as on all factors and regulatory requirements that have an influence on the determination of those charges. Transparency : the proposed Directive contains no provisions on the methods for calculating security charges that should be applied in each Member State. While the Commission acknowledges the wide diversity of airport regulation in the various Member States, a reasonable amount of information must nevertheless be provided by the operator to the air carriers so as to make the consultation process between airports and air carriers meaningful. To this end, the Directive establishes which information should be provided on a regular basis by the airport managing body. Air carriers should, in turn, give information as to their traffic forecasts, their intended fleet use and their present and future specific requirements at the airport, so as to allow the airport managing body to employ their capital and dedicate their capacity in an optimal manner. Air carriers should also have the right to be informed about security measures that are more stringent than required by Community law. Cost-relatedness : revenues from security charges shall only be used to meet security costs. Supervisory authority : a draft Directive that contains the principles to be respected by the main partners in the air transport industry i.e. the airports and air carriers, which have diverging interests, needs to be properly applied and adhered to at the level of the Member States. An authority to be established in each Member State that is in charge of ensuring the correct application of the Directive would be an appropriate guarantee that its provisions are respected. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 changed the economic outlook for the years to come in the Union and in the world, calling for an urgent and coordinated response from the Union in order to cope with the enormous economic and social consequences for all Member States. The challenges linked to the demographic context have been amplified by COVID-19. Reforms and investments to address structural weaknesses of the economies and to strengthen their resilience are therefore essential to set the economies back on a sustainable recovery path and avoid further widening of the divergences in the Union. In this context, as a complement to the REACT-EU initiative, the Commission proposes to strengthen the current framework for support to Member States and to provide direct financial support to Member States through an innovative tool to underpin long-term reforms and investments - notably in green and digital technologies - that will have a lasting effect on the productivity and resilience of the Union's economy. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes the ‘Recovery and Resilience Facility’. The scope of the instrument covers a wide range of policy areas, including areas related to cohesion, the dual transition (green and digital), competitiveness, productivity, health and smart innovation. Purpose The objective of the Facility is to promote the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union by (i) improving the resilience and adjustment capacity of Member States, (ii) mitigating the social and economic consequences of the crisis, and (iii) supporting the green and digital transitions towards a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. It shall thus contribute to restoring the growth potential of Member States' economies in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, encourage job creation and foster sustainable growth. To this end, the Facility shall provide Member States with direct financial support to reach milestones and targets for reforms and investments. Recovery and resilience plans To benefit from the Facility, Member States shall prepare recovery and resilience plans setting out their reform and investment programmes for the next four years, i.e. until 2024. These plans shall include reforms and public investment projects to be implemented through a coherent package. The plans shall be consistent with the challenges and priorities identified in (i) the European Semester framework, (ii) the National Reform Programmes, (iii) the National Energy and Climate Plans, (iv) the Just Transition Plans and (v) the Partnership Agreements and Operational Programmes adopted under EU funds. Member States shall submit their plans to the Commission by 30 April each year at the latest, but they may submit a first draft together with their draft national budget in October. The plans may form an annex to the relevant national reform programme. The Facility shall: - identify reforms and investments to address the challenges identified in the context of the European Semester and explain, inter alia, how they enhance the growth potential and economic and social resilience of the Member State concerned and contribute to greater cohesion; - include measures relevant to the green and digital transitions; - set out estimated total costs and appropriate milestones, targets and an indicative timetable for the implementation of the reforms and of the investments. Provided that the evaluation criteria are satisfactorily met, the Commission shall adopt a decision fixing the financial contribution to be received by the Member State (grant and, where appropriate, loan), as well as the milestones and targets. For the purposes of informing the preparation and the implementation of the recovery and resilience plans by Member States, the Council may discuss in the context of the European Semester the state of recovery, resilience and adjustment capacity in the Union on the basis of the Commission’s strategic and analytical information available. The recovery and resilience plans adopted by the Commission shall be communicated to the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission shall also report annually to both institutions on the progress made in the implementation of the plans by Member States and on expenditure under the Facility. Budgetary implications The financial envelope for the implementation of the facility shall be EUR 602 905 000 000 (in current prices). The envelope shall be financed from the borrowing operations of the Union. The bulk of the funding shall be provided in the form of grants, with possible supplements through loans. The total amount of grants available shall amount to EUR 334.950 million, while a further EUR 267.955 million shall be available in the form of loans. As far as grants are concerned, a maximum amount per Member State shall be determined on the basis of a predefined allocation key taking into account population, GDP per capita and unemployment. Member States may also apply for a loan for the implementation of their public reforms and investments. The maximum volume of loans for each Member State shall not exceed 4.7% of its gross national income. Given the temporary nature of the financing scheme of the Facility in relation to Member States’ economic recovery, the availability period of these resources is limited to 31 December 2024 for both the non-repayable financial support and for the loan support. As regards the non-repayable financial support, for at least 60 % of the total resources the necessary legal commitments should be entered into by 31 December 2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extended for a period of 6 months (or 7 months in some cases) the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and postponed the completion of certain periodic checks and continuing training which, under the relevant EU legislation, should have taken place during the period between 1 March 2020 (or 1 February 2020 in some cases) and 31 August 2020. Some Member States have submitted reasoned requests to the Commission for authorisation to extend certain periods again. The Commission has adopted six decisions authorising such extensions. Despite some improvements in the situation during the summer of 2020, the persistence of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2020 forced Member States to maintain or even reinforce the measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. As a consequence, transport operators may not be able to complete the formalities or procedures necessary to comply with certain provisions of EU law on the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or approvals, or on the completion of periodic checks and continuous training, or to take other necessary steps to maintain their validity, as was the case in spring 2020. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to adopt measures to remedy these problems and to ensure both legal certainty and the proper functioning of the legal acts concerned. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and to the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in response to the exceptional situation arising from the spread of COVID-19 in the fields of road, rail and inland waterway transport and maritime security during reference periods subsequent to those referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698. The proposal provides for adaptations, in particular for certain time limits, as well as the possibility for the Commission to authorise extensions on the basis of a request submitted by any Member State by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Such extensions should be limited to what is necessary in view of the period during which the completion of formalities, procedures, checks and training are likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, should not exceed six months. The proposal concerns specific provisions which affect the application of several directives and regulations concerning in particular: - the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers for driving licences; - tachographs in road transport; - the periodic technical inspection of motor vehicles and their trailers; - the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; - access to the international road haulage market and access to the international market for coach and bus services; - railway safety, the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union and the rules establishing a single European railway area; - the conditions for obtaining boatmasters' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the Union, technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and the improvement of ship and port facility security. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency so that the situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors are minimised."
2951EP7,"""""Scheme of generalised tariff preferences""""",0.754,0.839,0.035,0.194,0.303,0.807,0.749,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to revise, adapt and update the Regulation on applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union (EU) has granted trade preferences to developing countries through the Generalised Scheme of Tariff Preferences (GSP scheme) since 1971. It is part of its common commercial policy, in accordance with the general provisions governing the EU’s external action. It is one of the key EU trade instruments assisting developing countries in their efforts to ensure core human and labour rights, reduce poverty and promote sustainable development and good governance in developing countries. The Generalised System of Preferences helps developing countries, and particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs), to reduce poverty by offering them import preferences in order to generate or boost revenue from international trade. In addition, the scheme provides incentives in the form of additional tariff preferences, to countries that commit themselves to sustainable development and good government. The scheme grants preferential access to EU markets on a generalised and non-discriminatory basis to 176 eligible countries and territories. It has three arrangements: the general arrangement (often described simply as ""GSP""); the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (described as ""GSP+"") which offers additional preferences as incentives to support vulnerable developing countries in ratifying and implementing 27 international conventions on human and labour rights, environment and good governance; the Everything But Arms arrangement (EBA), which provides duty-free, quota-free access to LDCs. The present GSP scheme is implemented through successive regulations, each applying for three years. The current GSP regulation will expire on 31 December 2011. A recently completed midterm review provides the background for the planned Commission proposal for a revised regulation to replace the existing scheme upon expiry in 2013. Both the EBA arrangement and the rules of origin provisions fall outside the scope of this revision: the former, because it is not subject to periodic reviews; and the latter, because new legislation on rules of origin has entered into force in 2011. The proposed GSP Regulation herewith revises, adapts and updates the GSP scheme in replacement of the current regulation, so as to better reflect the contemporary global economic and trade landscape which has changed significantly since the original scheme was put into place. Option A : discontinuation: preferences are abandoned for GSP and GSP+ beneficiaries. EBA arrangement would remain. The economic and social effects for countries most in need are expected to be negative. LDCs would benefit, but the many other developing countries and economic sectors which are also most in need would suffer as preferential access disappears. This option would however have positive economic and social impacts for certain sectors in certain Member States at a time when so much emphasis is on boosting competitiveness, growth and job creation. And last, at a time of extreme pressure on public finances, it boosts tariff revenues. Option B : no policy change: there is a natural reduction in the level of import duties (and, therefore, preferences) due to preference erosion under the impact of further bilateral and multilateral trade deals. In the long run, when all multilateral and bilateral agreements are fully implemented, duties are likely to be so low that the idea of preferences becomes largely irrelevant – and so would a generalised system of preferences. Other totally different tools may have to be designed. Until then, the question is what can be done for the countries most in need of preferences. Option C : partial redesign: this comprises two sub-options (C1 and C2). Preferences are deferred for certain eligible countries: overseas countries and territories; high and upper middle income countries; countries with a preferential trade agreement covering substantially all preferences. The main difference between C2 and C1 concern the graduation of competitive sectors and the vulnerability criteria under GSP+. Option D : full redesign: in order to simplify the analysis, D sub-options are calculated as increments to C2 only. Three sub-options are assessed. D1 is a far reaching option. It provides full product coverage expansion and elimination of all sensitive products (eg, extending the duty-free, quota-free treatment of EBA countries) to all countries most in need (whether GSP or GSP+). This implies that the remaining beneficiaries are no longer subject to graduation. D2 and D3 are less far-reaching. They take all the parameters of C2 (graduation included) and add partial de-sensitisation (D2) and partial expansion in product coverage (D3). draft proposal would focus the GSP preferences on the countries most in need. This is achieved by enhancing GSP modalities related to the GSP eligibility criteria and the GSP graduation mechanism, which identifies competitive imports and suspends unwarranted preferences. Modification of the GSP+ mechanism : the scheme also expands its support under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) for those countries that commit to embracing core universal values on human, labour rights, environment and governance. While offering further opportunities for potential beneficiaries, the scheme will place more responsibility for countries and require stricter scrutiny of eligibility by the EU. special arrangement for least developing countries known as ‘Everything But Arms’, which was added to the GSP scheme in 2004, is unchanged and further supported by new elements in the scheme reflecting the aim of focusing GSP benefits on countries most in need."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the rule of law is one of the essential values upon which the Union is founded. As recalled by Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, these values are common to the Member States. Respect for these values must therefore be ensured throughout all Union policies. This includes the EU budget, where respect for fundamental values is an essential precondition for sound financial management and effective EU funding. The Commission considers that the European Union should be given the possibility to adopt the rules necessary for the protection of the Union’s budget in the case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The proposal is based on the 2014 Commission Communication ""A new EU framework to strengthen the rule of law"", the February 2018 Commission Communication ""A new and modern multiannual financial framework for a European Union that implements its priorities efficiently beyond 2020"" and the standards and principles developed by the Council of Europe. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation establishes the rules necessary for the protection of the Union’s budget in the case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. Measures : appropriate measures shall be taken where a generalised deficiency as regards the rule of law in a Member State affects or risks affecting the principles of sound financial management or the protection of the financial interests of the Union such as: (i) the proper functioning of the authorities of that Member State implementing the EU budget, in particular in the context of public procurement procedures; (ii) the proper functioning of investigative services in the context of the fight against fraud and corruption; (iii) effective judicial control by independent courts of acts or omissions of the abovementioned authorities; (iv) jeopardised the independence of the judiciary. Content of measures : the proposal lists the type of measures that could be taken and specifies that Member States receiving EU funds should receive them. This concerns in particular the suspension of payments or the implementation of the legal commitment or a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments where the Commission implements the Union budget directly or indirectly. Procedure : measures should be on the basis on a Council decision following a proposal from the Commission. The decision shall be deemed to have been adopted by the Council, unless it decides, by qualified majority, to reject the Commission proposal within one month of its adoption by the Commission. The European Parliament should also be fully involved at all stages. Proportionality : measures need to be adopted in full respect of the principles of transparency and proportionality. It is also important to ensure that the consequences of measures have a sufficient connection with the aim of the funding. This also points to the need to ensure that the consequences fall on those responsible for identified shortcomings. It should therefore reflect the fact the individual beneficiaries of EU funding, such as Erasmus students, researchers or civil society organisations, cannot be considered responsible for such breaches."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the customs 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing customs cooperation. Many of the activities in the customs area are of a cross-border nature, involving and affecting all Member States, and therefore they cannot be effectively and efficiently delivered by individual Member States. Since 2016, the Union Customs Code is the new legal customs framework. The Code triggered a massive digitalisation project with 17 different electronic systems to be fully in place by 2020. Some systems will be deployed gradually up to 2025. These electronic systems touch upon all customs procedures. The upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU implies disentangling the United Kingdom as a Member State from all existing customs electronic systems financed by customs 2020. These implications and costs however cannot be precisely estimated at this stage. The implementation of all these aspects can only be achieved through intense operational cooperation between customs administrations of the Member States, between them and other authorities, with trade and other third parties. It is therefore necessary to ensure the continuity of the Union’s financing of customs cooperation activities by establishing a new cooperation programme in this area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the customs programme for cooperation in the field of customs for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the customs 2020 programme. Objective : the general objective of the proposed new programme is to support the customs union and customs authorities to protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, to ensure security and safety within the Union and to protect the Union from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity. Customs cooperation and capacity building shall focus, on the one hand, on human networking and competency building actions and, on the other hand, IT capacity building actions. Like the current Customs 2020 programme, the new programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. It may provide funding in any form provided for in the Financial Regulation, in particular grants, procurements and reimbursement of expenses. Eligible actions : the programme shall cover expenses for preparation, monitoring, control, audit, evaluation and other activities for managing the programme and evaluating the achievement of its objectives. It shall also cover expenses relating to studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions, in so far as they are related to the objectives of the programme, as well as expenses linked to information technology networks focusing on information processing and exchange, including corporate information technology tools and other technical and administrative assistance needed in connection with the management of the programme. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of the European electronic systems ‘common components’ and ‘national components’ reflecting better the reality of electronic systems and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand and the Member States on the other hand have been listed. Lastly, a multi-annual strategic plan for customs, to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 950 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 25 September 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an international agreement with ASECNA establishing the conditions for the provision of a satellite-based augmentation service (SBAS) in Africa on the basis of the EGNOS European satellite navigation programme. The Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation was signed on 5 December 2016, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The European Union and Africa have been cooperating on satellite navigation since the 2011-2013 action plan implementing the Africa-EU strategic partnership. The need for cooperation in this field was reaffirmed in the 2014-2017 roadmap adopted at the Africa-EU summit in April 2014. The European satellite navigation programmes form a key part of European Union transport policy, especially air transport. They have been promoted internationally, mainly as a result of cooperation agreements entered into with countries such as the United States of America, China, South Korea and Israel. CONTENT: this proposal for a Council Decision seeks to authorise the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation. The Agreement establishes a framework for the cooperation required for setting up and operating an independent SBAS system, but based on the European EGNOS system, in ASECNA's area of competence. The aims of this Agreement are to develop satellite navigation and to provide associated services in ASECNA’s area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation by enabling it to benefit from European satellite navigation programmes. The Agreement comprises a technical part and also covers questions of financing and governance. The Union shall assist ASCENA in: The parties shall cooperate on: Financing: the cost of setting up and operating the infrastructure provided for by the Agreement, which belongs to ASECNA, will be financed by ASECNA's budget, by its member states or by contributions, in the form of loans or donations, from countries in the European Union and international financial institutions. In order to set up and operate the SBAS-ASECNA system, the Union will facilitate ASECNA's access to its cooperation and development funds for both current and future programmes. The Agreement provides for the setting up of a joint committee for management and correct implementation."
6339EP7,"""""High common level of network and information security""""",0.737,0.736,0.789,0.452,0.455,0.771,0.713,0.029,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: ensure a high common level of network and information security (NIS) across the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: network and information systems and services play a vital role in in facilitating the cross-border movement of goods, services and people. Substantial disruption of these systems in one Member State can affect other Member States and the EU as a whole. The resilience and stability of network and information systems is therefore essential to the smooth functioning of the internal market. The extent and frequency of security incidents, caused by human error or malicious attacks is increasing : the Commission’s public consultation found that 57 % of respondents had experienced NIS incidents over the previous year that had a serious impact on their activities. A 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that 38% of EU internet users are concerned about the safety of online payments. There is currently no effective mechanism at EU level for effective cooperation and collaboration and for secure information sharing on NIS incidents and risks among the Member States. However, the Digital Agenda for Europe and the related Council conclusions highlighted the shared understanding that trust and security are fundamental pre-conditions for the wide uptake of information and communication technologies (ICT). This proposal is presented in connection with the joint Communication of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on a European Cybersecurity Strategy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed three different options. · Option 1 : status quo: maintain the current approach. · Option 2: regulatory approach, consisting of a legislative proposal establishing a common EU legal framework for NIS regarding Member State capabilities, mechanisms for EU-level cooperation, and requirements for key private players and public administrations. · Option 3: mixed approach, combining voluntary initiatives for Member State NIS capabilities and mechanisms for EU-level cooperation with regulatory requirements for key private players and public administrations. The Commission concluded that Option 2 would have the strongest positive impacts. The quantitative assessment showed that this option would not impose a disproportionate burden on Member States. The costs for the private sector would also be limited since many of the entities concerned are already supposed to comply with existing security requirements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to effect a fundamental change in the way NIS is dealt with in the EU. It provides for regulatory obligations to create a level playing field and close existing legislative loopholes. The objectives of the proposed Directive are as follows: (1) To require all Member States to have in place a minimum level of national capabilities by establishing competent authorities for NIS, setting up Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), and adopting national NIS strategies and national NIS cooperation plans. (2) To ensure that the national competent authorities cooperate within a network enabling secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange as well as detection and response at EU level. Through this network, Member States will exchange information and cooperate, through the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) to counter NIS threats and incidents and facilitate a uniform application of the directive throughout the EU. (3) To ensure that a culture of risk management develops and that information is shared between the private and public sectors. Companies in the specific critical sectors – banking, stock exchanges, energy generation, transmission and distribution, transport (air, rail, maritime), health, internet services as well as public administrations will be required to: · assess the risks they face and adopt appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure NIS; · report to the competent authorities any incidents seriously compromising their networks and information systems and significantly affecting the continuity of critical services and supply of goods. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: cooperation and exchange of information between Member States should be supported by a secure infrastructure. The proposal will have EU budgetary implications only if Member States choose to adapt an existing infrastructure (e.g. sTESTA) and task the Commission to implement this under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. The one-off cost is estimated to be EUR 1 250 000 on condition that sufficient funds are available under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Alternatively, Member States can either share the one-off cost of adapting an existing infrastructure or decide to set up a new infrastructure and bear the costs, which are estimated to be approximately EUR 10 million per year.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Opening of tariff quotas : the Union negotiated tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The proposal aims therefore to open annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. Management : the Commission: should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adoption of amendments to this Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision concluding an agreement with one or more third countries; should adopt, by means of implementing acts, rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this Regulation and, as appropriate, provisions: (a) guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; (b) relating to the recognition of the document allowing the guarantees referred to in point (a) to be verified; and (c) on the issue of import licences and their period of validity."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : on 23 April 2007 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with certain countries of Central America, which resulted in a Association Agreement with Central America. The Agreement was initialled on 22 March 2011. The Agreement includes a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility of reinstating the MFN customs duty rate when, as a result of a trade liberalisation, imports take place in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. Furthermore, the Agreement also incorporates a Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas according to which, until 1 January 2020, preferential customs duties can be suspended when a certain annual import volume is reached. In order for these measures to be operational, the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism should be incorporated in EU, and the procedural aspects of their application as well as the rights of interested parties need to be specified. This is the purpose of the proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT : this proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism of the EU- Central America Association Agreement. 1) Principles on the imposition of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the Regulation where a product originating in a Central American country is, as a result of the reduction or the elimination of the customs duties on that product, being imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: a suspension of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties) to the Agreement; an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the most-favoured-nation (""MFN"") applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of the Agreement. None of these measures shall be applied within the limits of the preferential duty free tariff quotas granted by the Agreement. Initiation of proceedings : an investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to above, to justify such initiation. The request to initiate an investigation shall generally contain the following information: the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment. An investigation may also be initiated in the event that there is a surge of imports concentrated in one or several Member States, provided that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the conditions for initiation are met. The proposal makes provision for the procedures for initiating an investigation and the conditions under which the latter may be done. Investigation : following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation, which shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of its initiation. That time limit may be extended by a further period of three months in exceptional circumstances such as the involvement of an unusually high number of parties, or complex market situations. Prior surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in a Central American country is such that it could lead to a serious threat to the Union market, imports of that product may be subject to prior surveillance measures. Such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in the text. Prior surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in a Central American country have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty. Provisional measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure, including on imperative grounds of urgency. Provisional measures shall be shall not apply for more than 200 days. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that conditions regarding a serious threat to Union industry are met, the Commission shall refer the matter to the Association Committee. Where no recommendation has been made by the Association Committee or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the referral, the Commission may adopt a decision imposing definitive safeguard measures. The text also contains provisions on the termination of investigation and proceeding without measure. Duration and review of safeguard measures : it is provided that a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, and may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the Union industry is adjusting.. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. Confidentiality and transparency : the text contains provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information received pursuant to the Regulation. Information shall in any case be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information. At the same time, when initiating an investigation, provisions are made to ensure transparency, and interested parties and representatives of the Central American country concerned may inspect all information made available to the Commission, which shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable. There ate other provisions to ensure transparency, such as such as the Commission’s obligation to ensure password-protected online access to the non-confidential file through which all information which is not confidential shall be disseminated. The European Parliament shall be granted access to this online platform. 2) Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas: for bananas originating in Central America (fresh Bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category ""ST"" in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties) to the Agreement, a stabilisation mechanism shall apply until 1 January 2020. A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports from Central American country for products as indicated in the table in the Annex to the Regulation. The importation of these products at the preferential customs duty rate shall, in addition to the proof of origin established under Annex III (Definition of the concept of ""originating products"" and methods of administrative co-operation) of the Agreement with Central America, be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the competent authority of the Central American country from which the products are exported. Once the trigger volume is met during the corresponding calendar year, the Commission may temporarily suspend the preferential customs duty during that same year for a period of time not exceeding three months, and not going beyond the end of the calendar year. In case the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, the Commission shall apply the lesser of: (i) the base rate of customs duty or (ii) the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken. In case the Commission applies these actions, it shall immediately enter into consultations with the affected country to analyse and evaluate the situation on the basis of factual available data. These measures may be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
5019EP8,"""""Packaging and packaging waste""""",0.514,0.86,0.98,0.438,0.231,0.851,0.916,0.808,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to prevent and reduce the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment in order to facilitate Europe’s transition to a circular economy. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union’s economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aiming to amend Directive 94/62/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste; Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste; Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles; Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators; Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets ‘fit for purpose’; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction – more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the targets set by Directive 94/62/EC for the recovery and recycling of packaging and packaging waste to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy. The main points are as follows: Recovery, recycling and reuse : the proposal provides for an increase in the targets for preparing for re-use and the recycling of packaging waste. Thus, Member States must take the necessary measures to fulfil the following targets: no later than 31 December 2025 a minimum of 65% by weight of all packaging waste will be prepared for reuse and recycled; no later than 31 December 2025 the following minimum targets by weight for preparing for reuse and recycling will be met regarding the following specific materials contained in packaging waste: 55 % of plastic; 60% of wood; 75% of ferrous metal, aluminium, glass, and paper and cardboard; no later than 31 December 2030 a minimum of 75% by weight of all packaging waste will be prepared for reuse and recycled; no later than 31 December 2030 the following minimum targets by weight for preparing for reuse and recycling will be met regarding the following specific materials contained in packaging waste: 75% of wood; 85% of ferrous metal, aluminium, glass, and paper and cardboard. The Commission may propose revised levels of the targets for plastics for 2030 based on a review of progress made by Member States towards reaching those targets, taking into account the evolution of the types of plastics placed on the market and the development of new recycling technologies and the demand for recycled plastics. Packaging waste exported from the Union : this may only be counted towards the attainment of the targets laid down by the Member State in which the packaging waste was collected if the certain requirements are met and if, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the exporter can prove that the shipment of waste complies with the requirements of that Regulation and that the treatment of waste outside the Union took place in conditions that are equivalent to the requirements of the relevant Union environmental legislation. Rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets : the proposal provides for the adoption of harmonised methods of calculation for recycling rates throughout the EU. To ensure harmonised conditions for those calculations, the Commission will adopt detailed rules on the determination of recognised preparation for re-use operators and deposit-refund schemes and on the collection, verification and reporting of data. Member States should establish an effective system of quality control and traceability of the packaging waste. Reporting: in order to ensure the reliability of the data gathered on preparation for re-use the proposal sets out common rules for reporting. It lays down more precisely the rules according to which Member States should report what is effectively recycled and can be counted towards the attainment of the recycling targets. Early warning system : the proposal establishes an early warning system to detect shortcomings and allow taking action ahead of the deadlines for meeting the targets. The Commission shall draw up reports three years before each time-limit laid down. Simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations : it is proposed to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce implementation reports every three years and use exclusively the statistical data which Member States report every year to the Commission. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. When the Common Fisheries Policy ceases to apply to the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will no longer be part of the Union waters. Consequently, in case of a disorderly withdrawal, Union and United Kingdom vessels risk not having the possibility to utilise fully the fishing opportunities as established for 2019. To guarantee the sustainability of fisheries and in light of the importance of fisheries for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is important to keep open the possibility of arrangements for continued reciprocal fishing access by Union and United Kingdom vessels to each other’s waters, for a limited period of time, after the withdrawal date. On 17 and 18 December 2018, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council fixed the fisheries opportunities for 2019. Based on this, the Commission has concluded that two contingency measures are necessary for the fisheries sector in order to mitigate the significant impacts on the fisheries sector of a withdrawal from the United Kingdom without a withdrawal agreement. Alongside this measure on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, the Commission is proposing a measure to amend the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. CONTENT: the proposal shall amend Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, so as to provide a legal basis in Union law providing for the possibility for United Kingdom vessels to carry out fishing activities in Union waters and for introducing simplified and more efficient authorisation procedures for vessels wishing to fish in United Kingdom waters. In doing so major disruptions and delays in the authorisation procedures will be avoided. The proposed Regulation also continues the practice of exchanging quotas with the United Kingdom, as was the case when the United Kingdom joined the Union (approximately 1 000 quota exchanges take place each year between the United Kingdom and the Member States). The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ‘reciprocity’, i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends the current access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters. Consequently, authorisations will only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them in accordance with the fishing opportunity Regulations. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following that on which Union law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of targeted contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the basic Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy), Union fishing vessels enjoy equal access to EU waters and resources subject to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. From the end of the transitional period, the Common Fisheries Policy would no longer apply to the United Kingdom. The UK waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will then no longer be part of EU waters. To ensure sustainable fisheries and given the importance of fishing for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the authorisation procedures for fishing vessels. CONTENT: the proposal would amend EU Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 in order to create the appropriate legal framework valid until 31 December 2021, or until the date of conclusion of a fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom - whichever is earlier - on the continued reciprocal access of EU and UK vessels to each other's waters after 31 December 2020. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following the end of the transition period. The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ""reciprocity"", i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters on a basis satisfactory to the Union.

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the aim of the new agreement and protocol will enable 12 EU vessels to make use of fishing opportunities in Greenland’s waters for eight species: cod, pelagic redfish, demersal redfish, Greenland halibut, northern prawn, grenadier, capelin and Atlantic mackerel. The agreement will be valid for four years renewable for a further two. Members considered that the new agreement and protocol needed to be negotiated to bring them closer into line with fishing opportunities and scientific advice, to increase flexibility regarding catches, to introduce a lower by-catch quota and establish a six-year validity period for the protocol. In general, both the agreement and the protocol will contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular to reinforce monitoring, control and surveillance. The agreement provides for financial compensation from the EU of EUR 16 521 754, of which EUR 2 931 000 is earmarked for support for and the development of Greenland’s fisheries sector. It was stressed in the explanatory statement that the negotiations on the agreement and protocol thereto were held in parallel with the negotiations on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which delayed the conclusion of an agreement. It was also stressed that Brexit has destabilised relations with all North Atlantic countries and therefore particular attention needs to be paid to this state of affairs."
3140EP7,"""""Agricultural product quality schemes""""",0.754,0.81,0.0,0.581,0.485,0.771,0.841,0.057,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to put in place a coherent agricultural product quality policy. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: farmers and producers of agricultural products face competitive pressure resulting from policy reform, globalisation, the concentration of bargaining power in the retail sector, and the state of the economy. At the same time, consumers increasingly look for authentic products produced using specific and traditional methods. The diversity and quality of European Union agricultural production should be an important strength and source of competitive advantage for Union farmers. However, in order for consumers and buyers to be properly informed about the characteristics and farming attributes of agricultural product, they need to receive accurate and trustworthy labelling information. Most tools already exist at European Union level. Since the 1990s, Union agricultural product quality policy has been closely identified with three Union schemes, namely for protected designations of origin (PDOs) and protected geographical indications (PGIs), for organic farming, and for traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG). In addition, Union marketing standards have provided a legislative framework for fair competition and smooth functioning of the market since the inception of the common agricultural policy. Analysis and discussion with stakeholders has shown that these tools may be improved, simplified and made more coherent. In 2007 a major conference was held bringing together all types of quality schemes: ‘Food quality certification—adding value to farm produce’. The Conference led to the 2008 Green Paper on agricultural product quality, which elicited over 560 detailed stakeholder responses and provided the input for the Communication on agricultural product quality policy in 2009. In response to this communication, the European Parliament adopted the resolution , ‘Agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow?’ in March 2010. The Quality Package consists of a set of proposals designed to put in place a coherent agricultural product quality policy . It is aimed at assisting farmers to better communicate the qualities, characteristics and attributes of agricultural product, and at ensuring appropriate consumer information. The Quality Package includes: · a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on agricultural product quality schemes; · a proposal to modify Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (the single Common Market Organisation) concerning marketing standards for agricultural products; · guidelines setting out best practice for the development and operation of certification schemes relating to agricultural products and foodstuffs; · guidelines on the labelling of foodstuffs using Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) as ingredients. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: concerning geographical indications, the analysis showed strong justification for a Union-level geographical indications scheme and discarded alternatives to a European Union scheme for reasons of low efficiency and effectiveness (including co-regulation and self-regulation by the sector, no action at European Union level, protection through the international Lisbon Agreement , replacement by a notification system for national geographical indications, and protection through the existing Community collective trade mark). The impact assessment identified considerable ground for reducing complexity and facilitating enforcement by merging the agricultural product and foodstuffs scheme with those in the alcoholic beverages sectors, while assuring the specificities of each system. The impact assessment found that merging the instruments for protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI) would diminish the added-value benefits of the PDO identification. Concerning traditional specialities guaranteed, three options were analysed: (i) introducing the term 'traditional' as optional quality term and abolishing the current scheme; (ii) no EU action; (iii) and simplifying the current scheme (allowing only registration with reservation of the name). The impact assessment showed that eliminating the TSG scheme would lead for protected names to loss of the economic and social benefits of EU-wide protection and was found to be unacceptable to stakeholders and to the EU legislator. In social terms, the designations of PDO, PGI and TSG were found to contribute to the continuation of traditional forms of production to the benefit of both producers and consumers. However, both the impact assessments for geographical indications and for traditional specialities guaranteed highlighted the widespread failure of these schemes to attract participation of very small-scale producers, notwithstanding that small-scale producers are often associated with artisanal product, traditional methods and local marketing, the European Union schemes are seen as burdensome in terms of application, necessitate costly controls, and require adherence to a specification. Therefore, further study and analysis will be carried out in order to assess the problems faced by small-scale producers in participating in Union quality schemes. On the basis of the results of this analysis, the Commission may propose appropriate follow-up. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2), and for Title II also Article 118(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Quality Package aims to improve the Union legislation in the field of quality, as well as in the operation of national and private certification schemes, in order to make them simpler, more transparent and easier to understand, adaptable to innovation, and less burdensome for producers and administrations The single Regulation for agricultural product quality schemes presents three complementary schemes (designations of origin and geographical indications; traditional specialities guaranteed; optional quality terms) in a single regulatory structure, overseen by a single quality policy committee. A separate Regulation covers the Marketing Standards. 1. Designations of origin and geographical indications, excluding wines, aromatised wines and spirits : the proposal maintains and reinforces the scheme for agricultural products and foodstuffs, but does not bring together the geographical indications schemes for wines, for spirits, or for aromatized wines. In the light of relatively recent reforms of the wine and spirits legislation, at this stage, the schemes should remain distinct. This issue can be reconsidered at a later date. In the meantime, the rules for the scheme for agricultural products and foodstuffs will be converged, where appropriate, to those for wines. The main elements designed to strengthen and simplify the scheme are the following: · recognition of the roles and responsibilities of groups applying for registration of names with regard to monitoring, promotion and communication; · the reinforcement and clarification of the level of protection of registered names and the common Union symbols; · the procedure to register names is shortened; · the respective roles of Member States and groups applying for registration have been clarified with regard to the enforcement of protection of the registered names throughout the European Union, and · the definitions of designations of origin and geographical indications are more closely aligned to international usage. The proposal streamlines the current process of registration of designations of origin and geographical indications by shortening time delays. In addition, certain legal issues are clarified and terminology aligned with the recently adopted legislation on geographical indications for wine. Minimum common rules on official controls to ensure product follows the specification and to ensure correct labelling in the marketplace are also laid down. The scope of the Regulation is maintained (agricultural products for human consumption and certain other products), while dark chocolate is added. 2. Traditional specialities guaranteed : the proposal maintains the scheme for reservation of names of traditional specialities guaranteed across the European Union, but discontinues the option of registering names without reservation. The function of giving publicity, but not protection, to traditional products is best accomplished at national (or regional) level, and European Union action cannot be justified. The renewed European Union scheme for traditional specialities guaranteed is simplified (registration process streamlined by shortening delays, procedures aligned on PDO-PGI ones) and targeted in several respects: (i) the criterion of tradition is extended to 50 years (from 25 years) to reinforce the credibility of the scheme; (ii) the scheme is restricted to prepared meals and processed product; (iii) and definitions and procedural requirements are substantially simplified to improve understanding of the scheme. 3. Optional quality terms : concerning the optional quality terms, which have in common with the quality schemes that they are optional and assist farmers to identify value-adding characteristics and attributes of product in the marketplace, it is proposed to bring these into the present regulation. The optional quality terms are not amended in content, but adapted to the legislative framework of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Further study and analysis will be carried out in order to assess the problems faced by producers of mountain products in labelling their products on the market. On the basis of the results of this analysis, the Commission may propose appropriate follow-up. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: none of the European Union schemes have budgetary implications. However, it has been shown necessary for the Commission to take a more active role to protect the names of the quality schemes and the Union symbols, particularly in third countries. To achieve this, additional budgetary resources are necessary. The initial estimate of appropriations necessary for measures in particular for the registration and defence of logos, indications and abbreviations in 3rd countries amounts to EUR 110 000 in 2012 and EUR 150 000 annually as from 2013.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the internal market is one of the EU’s greatest successes. Nevertheless, it has to continuously adapt to a rapidly changing environment characterised by digital revolution and globalisation. Still, barriers to a proper functioning of the internal market remain and new obstacles are emerging. Moreover, only 6 % of EU citizens feel well informed about their rights as a citizen of the Union and only 36 % feel fairly well informed. Action is required at EU level to ensure the consistent development of the internal market; non-discrimination; consumer protection; effective competition; the development of Member States’ capabilities and of cooperation between them; and the tackling of cross-border issues. Under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, the proposed new programme brings together activities financed under five previous programmes in the areas of business competitiveness (COSME), consumer protection (Regulation (EU) No 254/2014), customers and end-users in financial services (Regulation (EU) 2017/826), policy making in financial services (Regulation (EU) 258/2014) and the food chain (Regulation (EU) 652/2014) respectively. All of these activities are united by their shared objectives to regulate, implement, facilitate, enforce and protect various activities and actors within the internal market. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the programme for improving the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness of enterprises, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the framework for financing of development, production and dissemination of European statistics. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021 to 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The scope of the proposed programme covers the areas of the internal market, SME competitiveness and European statistics in a comprehensive way. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: making the internal market work better : the objective is to facilitate the prevention and removal of obstacles and to support the development, implementation and enforcement of the Union law in the areas of the internal market for goods and services, public procurement, market surveillance as well as in the areas of company law and contract and extra-contractual law, anti-money laundering, free movement of capital, financial services and competition, including the development of governance tools; improving the competitiveness of businesses, especially SMEs : improving the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular SMEs: building on the success of the current COSME programme, the Commission proposes to strengthen support for small enterprises to facilitate their access to markets, including the internationalisation of SMEs, the business environment, the competitiveness of certain sectors, the modernisation of industry and the promotion of entrepreneurship. SME loan guarantees previously granted under the COSME programme shall now be granted under the SME component of InvestEU; increasing standardisation : the programme shall also enable the financing of European standardisation and stakeholder participation in setting up European standards. It shall support the development of high-quality international financial reporting and auditing standards; promoting the interests of consumers : the programme shall empower, assist and educate consumers, businesses and civil society by: (i) ensuring a high level of consumer protection, sustainable consumption and product safety notably by supporting competent enforcement authorities and consumer representative organisations and cooperation actions; (ii) ensuring that all consumers have access to redress and; provision of adequate information on markets and consumers; (iii) enhancing the participation of consumers, other financial services end-users and civil society in financial services policy-making; (iv) promoting a better understanding of the financial sector; contributing to a high level of health for humans, animals and plants throughout the food chain : funding shall support the safe production of food, the prevention and eradication of animal diseases and plant pests, and the improvement of animal welfare in the EU. It shall also promote market access for EU food producers, contribute to exports to third-countries, and significantly support the agri-food industry as a leading sector of the EU economy; producing and communicating high-quality statistics on Europe : the programme establishes the financial framework for providing high-quality, comparable and reliable European statistics to underpin the design, monitoring and evaluation of all the Union policies. This replaces the predecessor European statistical programme. The proposed programme also includes new initiatives aimed at improving the functioning of the internal market, such as the initiative ‘An ambitious and innovative competition policy for a stronger Union in the digital age, Joint Cluster Initiative’ (e.g. to respond to market developments linked to the use of big data and algorithms) and the initiative for collaborations between clusters or clusters of businesses. Implementation of the Programme shall be based on annual or multi-annual work programme or programmes. The contribution of the programme to the overall objective of increasing the share of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives to 25% shall be monitored. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 4.089 billion for the period 2021-2027. This shall be supplemented by an allocation of EUR 2 billion from the InvestEU Fund, in particular its SME window, which shall make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while investment conditions in Europe have improved since the launch of the Juncker plan in 2014, thanks to a more favourable economic situation and government interventions such as the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI), there is still a significant investment gap in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major shock to the world and EU economies. The contraction of EU GDP in 2020 - forecast at around 7.5% - is expected to be much deeper than during the 2009 financial crisis. For the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission therefore considers it necessary to propose a reinforced EU investment programme to provide crucial support to businesses and to ensure a strong focus of private investors on the Union's medium and long-term priorities, including the Green Deal for Europe and digital transitions, as well as increased resilience. This is why the Commission is withdrawing its May 2018 proposal for the InvestEU programme and submitting a new proposal that takes full account of the partial agreement reached in April 2019 between the Parliament and the Council. This new proposal (i) increases the amount of the initially proposed financial envelope (ii) amends the scope of the proposal to reflect on the post-pandemic needs of the European economy. It builds on the lessons learned from the EFSI evaluations and previous financial instruments (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020, COSME, Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme etc.). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to create the InvestEU programme for the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027 in order to bring together under a single structure all financing from the EU budget in the form of loans and guarantees. The InvestEU programme shall be based on the following elements: The InvestEU Fund The InvestEU Fund shall mobilise public and private investment through a EU budget guarantee of EUR 75 153 850 000 (in current prices) which aims to support the investment projects of implementing partners. The Commission proposes that the guarantee be provisioned at 45%, which means that EUR 33 800 000 000 from the EU budget shall be set aside in case calls are made on the guarantee. The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group shall remain a privileged implementing partner for the Invest EU. It shall implement 75% of the EU guarantee. National development banks or institutions may also become implementing partners. Five policy windows The InvestEU Fund shall operate through 5 policy windows, each of which is aimed at addressing market failures or investment shortfalls within their specific scope: 1. sustainable infrastructure; 2. research, innovation and digitisation; 3. SMEs; 4. social investment and skills; 5. strategic European investments. In addition to increasing the resources of the sustainable infrastructure window, the Commission proposes to broaden the scope of the programme by adding a fifth strand - strategic European investment - with a view to meeting the future needs of the European economy and promoting and ensuring the strategic autonomy of the Union in key sectors. This window shall be endowed with an amount of up to EUR 31 153 850 000. This new window shall support final recipients established in a Member State and carrying out an activity of strategic importance to the Union, in particular with a view to green and digital transitions and increased resilience in areas such as: - provision of critical health care, manufacturing and stockpiling of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and medical supplies, strengthening the capacity to respond to health crises; - critical infrastructure (e.g. energy, transport, environment, health, 5G, Internet of Things); - key enabling, transformative, green and digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, block chains, renewable energy technologies, biomedicine). The InvestEU Advisory Hub The advisory hub would provide technical support and assistance in the preparation, development, structuring and implementation of projects, including capacity-building. The EIB Group would play a central role in the implementation of advisory support under the Hub. A financial envelope of EUR 724 733 000 (in current prices) is foreseen for the InvestEU Advisory Hub. The InvestEU Portal The InvestEU Portal shall be established to provide for an easily accessible and user-friendly project database to promote visibility of investment projects searching for financing with enhanced focus on the provision of a possible pipeline of investment projects, compatible with Union law and policies. Governance An investment committee of independent experts shall remain responsible for approving individual requests. The Commission performs a policy check on proposed financing or investment operations to verify that they are compliant with EU law before a proposal is submitted to the Investment Committee. Budgetary implications For the period 2021-2027, the budgetary framework (commitments at current prices) foreseen for the InvestEU programme amounts to EUR 33 524 733 000. The overall provisioning will amount to EUR 33 800 million, of which EUR 1 billion will be covered by revenues, repayments and recoveries generated by existing financial instruments and the EFSI."
1066EP7,"""""Combating late payment in commercial transactions""""",0.702,0.857,0.86,0.645,0.364,0.94,0.815,0.571,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to combat late payments in commercial transactions between businesses or between businesses and public authorities with a view to improving the cash flow of European business. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/35/EC was adopted to combat late payment in commercial transactions between businesses or between businesses and public authorities. It specifies, inter alia, that statutory interest may be charged when payment is not made within the contractual or legal deadline. There is overwhelming evidence that, despite the entry into force of Directive 2000/35/EC late payment in commercial transactions is still a general problem within the EU. In addition, there is also evidence in a number of Member States of unjustifiably long contractual payment periods in transactions involving public administrations. Given the importance of public procurement in the EU (more than 1 943 billion euro per year), late payment by public authorities has a strong negative impact on enterprises. Many public authorities do not face the same financing constraints as businesses and late payment in their case is avoidable. It should therefore be more severely sanctioned when it occurs. Moreover, diverging payment attitudes across the EU might hamper business participation in public tenders, which distorts competition and undermines the functioning of the internal market. It is therefore essential to modify Directive 2000/35/EC. While safeguarding the main elements of the Directive, it is essential to introduce additional tools to reduce the number of late payments in commercial transactions, to shorten payment periods for public administrations and to substantially reinforce the incentives for public administrations to pay in time by recasting the Directive, incorporating in a single text both the substantive amendments made to the Directive and its unchanged provisions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers the following options: Option 1: baseline option- comprises a number of recently adopted measures that will quicken the payment process and introduce new means of pursuing judicial and extra-judicial claims for the recovery of outstanding payments for commercial transactions in cross-border cases within the EU. Option 2a (non-legislative): the organisation of awareness raising activities targeted at businesses. Option 2b (non-legislative): the organisation of awareness raising activities targeted at organisations representing SMEs. Option 2c (non-legislative): Publication of information on bad debtors. Option 3a (legislative): Harmonisation of payment periods. Option 3a/1: The harmonisation of payment periods between economic operators. Option 3a/2: the harmonisation of the periods for payment by national authorities to conomic operators. Option 3b (legislative): increasing the “margin” interest rate. Option 3c (legislative): the abolition of the threshold. Option 3d (legislative): the introduction of a “Late Payment Fee”. Option 3e (legislative): the introduction of a “Late Payment Compensation”. Option 3f (legislative): Extending the role of representing organisations. Only options 3a/2, 3c, 3d and 3e meet the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and consistency. Therefore, these 4 options constitute the basis of this proposal. CONTENT: this proposal is part of the Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Jobs and implements the Small Business Act which highlighted the importance of SMEs for the competitiveness of the EU economy and the Commission Communication on an European Economic Recovery Plan which called in particular for public authorities to pay invoices for supplies and services within one month. This recast of Directive 2000/35/EC aims at improving the effectiveness and the efficiency of remedies for late payment through the introduction of an entitlement to the recovery of administrative costs and compensation for internal costs incurred due to late payment. More specifically, the proposal lays down the following: the provisions of Directive 2000/35/EC on its scope (Article 1 of this proposal), interest in case of late payment (Article 3), the retention of title (Article 8) and the recovery procedure for unchallenged claims (Article 9) remain fundamentally unchanged. The various definitions and concepts are streamlined and brought together in Article 2. The reasons for the other proposed substantive amendments are the following: Article 1(2) removes the possibility that claims for interest of less than €5 may be excluded by Member States. This will clear a hurdle for claiming interest for late payments, in particular for SMEs and for late payment in smaller transactions where interest amounts to only a small sum. Article 4 specifies that, in the case of late payment, creditors will be entitled to obtain a sum for internal recovery costs related to the amount paid late. The objective is twofold: firstly, the creditor would be able to recover his internal administrative costs related to late payment and, secondly, this would have a deterrent effect on debtors, additional to the statutory interest. Article 5 of the proposal tackles late payment by public authorities which will be obliged as a general rule to pay invoices for commercial transactions leading to the delivery of goods or the provision of services within 30 days. Past this period, the creditor will in principle be entitled to compensation of 5% of the amount specified, in addition to the interest for late payment and the compensation for recovery costs. The budgetary impact for national authorities will be proportional to their capacity to ensure compliance with the provisions of the directive. In addition, the expected improvement in payment behaviour of public authorities will help reduce the number of business bankruptcies and thus reduce the social costs that they entail. Article 6 of the proposal strengthens the provisions about grossly unfair contractual clauses. It includes a provision whereby a clause which excludes interest for late payment will always be considered as grossly unfair. Article 7 obliges Member States to ensure full transparency about the rights and obligations stemming from this directive and in particular to publish the statutory interest rate. This aims at providing in the most appropriate way practical information to businesses, and especially SMEs, and will enable them to take action against debtors paying late. Article 10 lays down the monitoring and evaluation system allowing other European institutions and stakeholders an insight into the actual implementation of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications are limited to administrative expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: International maritime shipping remains the only means of transportation not included in the Union's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, it emitted 13% of the total Union greenhouse gas emissions from transport. In its Resolution of February 2014 on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, Parliament noted that all sectors of the economy would need to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if the Union is to deliver its fair share of global efforts. In the future, seaborne trade volumes are likely to grow, which will lead to a significant increase of associated GHG emissions if mitigation measures are not put in place swiftly. According to a study from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), depending on future economic and energy developments, global shipping emissions could grow between 50% and 250% by 2050. The aim of the EU MRV Regulation is to collect data on shipping emissions for further policymaking and to incentivise emission reductions by providing information on ships' efficiency to relevant markets. It obliges companies to monitor, report and verify the fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and energy efficiency of their ships on voyages to and from European Economic Area (EEA) ports on an annual basis, starting from 2018. Following the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in October 2016 the IMO adopted the legal framework for a global data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships (“global IMO DCS”). Taking into account the coexistence of these two monitoring, reporting and verification systems, the Commission has examined how the two systems could be aligned in order to reduce the administrative burden on vessels, while preserving the objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is a partial alignment of the two monitoring, reporting and verification systems to help reduce the administrative burden on shipping companies, while preserving the key objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. However, this partial alignment should not change the EU MRV Regulation in terms of governance, the scope of the Regulation and its requirements for verification, transparency and reporting of CO2 emissions. Any amendment to the EU MRV Regulation should therefore be limited to aligning it with the IMO global data collection system for aspects relating to definitions, monitoring parameters and monitoring plans and templates. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2015/757 proposal aims at reducing the administrative burden for ships performing maritime transport activities that are covered by both the EU MRV Regulation and the global IMO DCS while preserving the specific objectives of the EU action in this area. Therefore, the proposal seeks to: · amend the definitions of ""company"" and ""reporting period"" and also the attribution of monitoring and reporting obligations in case of ""changes of company"". This will ensure that the same legal entities monitor and report according to similarly calculated reporting periods for their ships performing EEA-related maritime transport activities under the EU MRV Regulation and under the IMO's global data collection system; · amend the monitoring parameters: for this purpose, (i) the deadweight parameter should be provided, but the declaration of the ""cargo carried"" should remain optional; (ii) the parameter ""time at sea"" should be replaced by the parameter ""hours underway"" as defined in the IMO global data collection system; (iii) the ""distance travelled"" should be calculated according to the method provided by the IMO global data collection system in order to reduce the administrative burden; · streamline the content of monitoring plans to take into account the IMO's global data collection system, except for those provisions which are necessary to ensure that only EU-related data are monitored and reported under the EU MRV Regulation. Therefore, all provisions for ""per voyage"" monitoring should be maintained in the monitoring plan. On the other hand, some relevant features of the EU MRV Regulation should be maintained:  scope in terms of ships and activities covered under the EU MRV Regulation will be maintained (thus covering the majority of ships above 5000 GT calling at EU ports for maritime transport purposes); ships' CO2 emissions within Union ports are also to be monitored and reported separately. Also data on voyages internal to any EU Member State is to be monitored and reported so as to enable Member States authorities to have robust and comparable data of their national shipping emissions. Current MRV provisions on verification of data by accredited third parties are to be kept ; the EU MRV Regulation provisions on publication of individual ships' data of CO2 emissions and energy efficiency is also to be kept."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002, the Union and its Member States committed themselves to act against the continued decline of many fish stocks. Cod, herring and sprat are the subject of important fisheries in the Baltic Sea. They are also important components of the Baltic ecosystem and there are also strong biological interactions between them. Scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ('ICES') has indicated that the current exploitation rates for some of these stocks are not consistent with achieving maximum sustainable yield. A management plan for the Baltic Sea cod stocks has been in place since 2007 but the stocks of herring and sprat are not yet subject to a management plan. This hinders the sustainable management of these fisheries, and does not provide stability of fishing opportunities for the fishermen operating in these fisheries. In addition, Member States and stakeholders have expressed support for the development and implementation of management plans for the key Baltic stocks. In order to increase predictability for fishermen and to ensure high, stable and sustainable catches , the proposal is the first multiannual plan adopted in accordance with the new Common Fisheries Policy which entered into force in January 2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three options were analysed from biological, environmental and economic-social aspects. The option with most beneficial impact has been then developed into the present multiannual plan: to ensure sustainable fisheries at MSY level by 2015 for the stocks concerned is to achieve biological and environmental benefits. The probable reduction in the overall amount of fishing would also imply a reduction in emissions from vessel engines; as for the economic-social impact , bringing the herring and sprat stocks under a management plan would provide a systematic basis for setting annual TACs in a way which would provide the pelagic sector with predictability of catches which would help support business planning and stability of supply; the abolishment of fishing effort system and of requirement of single area fishing will simplify the legal framework and reduce administrative burden on Member State and industry. CONTENT: the Commission proposes, in the framework of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a multiannual fisheries management plan for the Baltic Sea that applies to cod, herring and sprat stocks. This plan replaces the management plan in place for the two Baltic cod stocks. The plan will ensure the sustainable exploitation of these Baltic Sea stocks, and provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on interactions within and between the stocks and with other aspects of the ecosystem and environment. In accordance with the overall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources, the main elements of the plan are: objectives and targets (Achieve levels of fishing mortality consistent with the principle of maximum sustainable yield); conservation reference points expressed in spawning biomass levels and specific conservation measures; provisions related to the landing obligation; framework of technical measures; periodic evaluation of the plan based on scientific advice. The plan does not include annual limits on fishing effort. It establishes regional cooperation in respect of adopting technical measures, provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for the by catches in the fisheries for the stocks concerned. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission decided that cohesion policy should remain an essential element of the next financial package and underlined its pivotal role in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. It proposed a number of important changes to the way cohesion policy is designed and implemented. Concentrating funding on a smaller number of priorities better linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, focusing on results, monitoring progress towards agreed objectives, increasing the use of conditionalities and simplifying the delivery are among the major hallmarks of the proposal. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by correcting imbalances between its regions. The ERDF supports regional and local development by co-financing investments in R&D and innovation; climate change and environment; business support to SMEs; services of common economic interest; telecommunication, energy and transport infrastructures; health, education and social infrastructures; and sustainable urban development. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a certain number of options were assessed in particular in relation to the ERDF contribution to two public goods: (i) contribution to employment, R&D and innovation through enterprise support; (ii) investing in basic infrastructure (e.g. transport, energy, environment, social and health infrastructure). The options examined included the status quo, changes to make funding more targeted, and an option which would be significantly more restrictive in scope compared with current funding options. The option of increased targeting was chosen, which increases the efficiency, effectiveness and EU added value of funding, but at the same time leaves regions sufficient flexibility regarding investment, and minimises the risk that activities requiring funding fall outside the scope of intervention. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 178 and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation determines the scope of intervention of the ERDF, and also defines a negative list of activities which will not be eligible for support. It defines investment priorities for each of the thematic objectives. Thematic objectives : transition regions and more developed regions will be required to focus the largest part of their allocation (except for the ESF) on energy efficiency and renewable energy, competitiveness of SMEs, and innovation. Less developed regions will be able to devote their allocation to a wider range of objectives reflecting the broader range of development needs. The mechanism proposed provides that: at least 80% of resources are focused on energy efficiency and renewables, research and innovation and SME support in more developed and transition regions of which 20% for energy efficiency and renewables. Given the ongoing restructuring needs in those regions phasing out from the Convergence objective, the minimum percentage shall be reduced to 60%; at least 50% of resources are focused on energy efficiency and renewables, research and innovation and SME support in less developed regions of which 6% for energy efficiency and renewables. Sustainable urban development : the proposed Regulation provides for an increased focus on sustainable urban development. The increased focus is to be achieved through the earmarking of a minimum of 5% of ERDF resources for sustainable urban development, the establishment of an urban development platform to promote capacity building and exchange of experience, and the adoption of a list of cities where integrated actions for sustainable urban development will be implemented. Regions suffering from severe natural or demographic handicaps : the proposal states that particular attention shall be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions. Outermost regions : lastly, the proposed Regulation includes specific measures shall be adopted to take account of the structural social and economic situation of the outermost regions, which is compounded by certain specific features which severely restrain their development. The specific measures shall include conditions of access to the Structural Funds. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund). The present proposal establishes minimum shares for the ESF for each category of regions defined in the proposal for a General Regulation. This results in a minimum overall share for the ESF of 25 % of the budget allocated to cohesion policy (excluding the allocation to the Connecting Europe Facility), i.e. EUR 84 billion. This implies that a maximum of EUR 183,3 billion remains available for the ERDF for the period 2014-2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for bananas in the EU (EU) has traditionally provided a preferential trade regime in favour of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-exporting countries. For several ACP states, banana production for export to the EU forms an important economic activity with multiplier effects for the rest of the economy. The EU's banana CMO has been challenged since 1995 through the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Dispute Settlement Mechanism, whose Appellate Body decisions have repeatedly ruled against it. Consequently, the EU has negotiated a trade agreement on bananas within the framework of the WTO. This supports the completion of the Doha Development Agenda's (DDA) agricultural modalities and the full Doha Round. Implementation of this agreement will lead to the reduction of the ACPs' preference margin. In order to promote the gradual integration of banana-exporting ACP countries into the global economy, the EU has provided assistance to the banana sectors of a number of countries through the Special System of Assistance (SSA, 1994-1999) and the Special Framework of Assistance (SFA, 1999-2008). The SFA operated in 12 banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The SFA operated in twelve banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The external evaluation of the SFA highlights positive results, as stated in the draft Communication on the Biennial Report on the Special Framework of Assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas. Certain countries managed to enhance competitiveness, as reflected in ACP bananas' stable export volumes and EU market share (see COM(2010)0103). However, production costs in ACP countries generally remain higher than in Most Favoured Nation (MFN) countries. The results of measures to support diversification are less visible and will require more efforts. A reduction in tariff preferences for ACP banana-supplying countries will lead to additional adjustment requirements, building on the adaptation and restructuring processes underway. In view of these challenges, the Commission proposes to create an ACP Banana Accompanying Measures programme for the main ACP banana-supplying countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (“DCI instrument.) The Banana Accompanying Measures to be adopted aim at: enhancing the competitiveness of the banana export sector, where this is sustainable, taking into account the situation of different stakeholders in the chain; promoting the economic diversification of banana-dependent areas; addressing broader impacts generated by the adaptation process, possibly related but not restricted to employment and social services, land use and environmental restoration, and macroeconomic stability. They will take into account the results of and experiences gained through the SSA and the SFA. The Banana Accompanying Measures are proposed as a temporary programme with a maximum duration of four years (2010-2013). The main ACP banana supplying countries are: Belize, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname. The budget for the measures is EUR 190 million. Within this amount, the Commission will fix the maximum amount available to each eligible ACP banana-supplying country for financing the actions above on the basis of a set of objective indicators. The indicators shall include trade in bananas with the EU; the importance of banana exports to the economy in the ACP country concerned; and country's level of development. The measurement of the allocation criteria shall be based on data from years preceding 2009. The Commission will adopt multi-annual support strategies and ensure that such strategies complement the geographic strategy papers of the countries concerned, and the temporary nature of these banana accompanying measures. The support strategies may be reviewed ad hoc, if necessary, but shall not be submitted to a mid-term review. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budget is EUR 190 million. The programme will be financed through appropriations under the expenditure of Heading 4 (""The EU as a Global Player""). It is proposed to use part of the available margin under this heading for EUR 75.9 million. Commission services have assessed the availability of funds over the period 2010-2013 in order to ascertain redeployment possibilities because of potential underutilisation, absorption constraints and/or political circumstances. The analysis leads to a proposed redeployment of EUR 95.8 million under Heading 4. For the remainder (EUR 18.3 million) the Commission proposes the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument. Lastly, it should be noted that the total financial reference amount for the implementation of the DCI Regulation over the period 2007-2013 is now EUR 17 087 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: information society services and especially intermediary services have become an important part of the EU’s economy and daily life of Union citizens. Twenty years after the adoption of the existing legal framework applicable to such services laid down in e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, new and innovative business models and services, such as online social networks and marketplaces, have allowed business users and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. A majority of EU citizens now use those services on a daily basis. However, the digital transformation and increased use of those services has also resulted in new risks and challenges, both for individual users and for society as a whole. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more specifically, intermediary services). It aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the EU, by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member States have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. The proposed regulation lays down harmonised rules on the provision of intermediary services in the internal market. In particular, it establishes: - a framework for the conditional exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services; - rules on specific due diligence obligations tailored to certain specific categories of providers of intermediary services; - rules on the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, including as regards the cooperation of and coordination between the competent authorities. This proposal should apply to intermediary services provided to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or residence in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment of the providers of those services. Specific provisions The proposal lays down: - measures to counter illegal goods, services or content online, such as a mechanism for users to flag such content and for platforms to cooperate with ‘trusted flaggers’; - new obligations on traceability of business users in online marketplaces, to help identify sellers of illegal goods; - effective safeguards for users, including the possibility to challenge platforms’ content moderation decisions; - transparency measures for online platforms on a variety of issues, including on the algorithms used for recommendations; - obligations for very large platforms to prevent the misuse of their systems by taking risk-based action and by independent audits of their risk management systems; - access for researchers to key data of the largest platforms, in order to understand how online risks evolve; - oversight structures to address the complexity of the online space: EU countries will have the primary role, supported by a new European Board for Digital Services; for very large platforms, enhanced supervision and enforcement by the Commission. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact of the proposal should be covered by the allocations foreseen in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 under the financial envelopes of the Single Market Programme and the Digital Europe Programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents is enshrined in Article 255 of the Treaty, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Provisions for this right have been set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. In 2004, following an in-depth review of the Regulation, the Commission concluded that it was working well and as result considered it inappropriate to amend the Regulation in the short term. A number of recent initiatives have, however, required the Commission to reassess its position. Firstly, the “European Transparency Initiative” (a review of the Regulation), secondly the adoption of a Parliamentary Resolution in April 2006 which asked the Commission to come forward with proposals for amending the Regulation; and thirdly the adoption of the Arhus Convention concerning access to documents containing environmental information and its interaction with Regulation (EC) No 1049. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to amend Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on the basis of the review process. In short, the Commission proposes the following: Purpose and beneficiaries: the wording in Article 1 (a) has been slightly modified to clarify the purpose of the Regulation and to grant public access to documents. The right of access will be granted to any natural or legal person, regardless of nationality or State of residence – this approach is consistent with the Arhus Regulation. Scope and definitions: the proposal specifies that the Regulation will apply to all documents held by an institution concerning a matter relating to the policies, activities and decisions falling within its sphere of responsibility. In addition a new paragraph has been added clarifying that documents submitted to Courts by parties other than the institutions do not fall within the scope of the Regulation (the recall, the TEU excludes the Court of Justice from the right of access to documents). Access to documents relating to the exercise of investigative powers will also be excluded until the relevant decision can no longer be challenged by an action for annulment or the investigation is closed. During this investigation phase, only the specific rules relating to this field will apply. Thus, information obtained from natural or legal persons in the course of such investigations should continue to be protected after the relevant decision has become definitive. The wide definition of a “document” is maintained. Exceptions: in order to align the proposed amendments with the Arhus Regulation, the Commission proposes that the exception seeking to protect the environment (Article 6(2) of the Arhus Regulation) is added to the Regulation on public access to documents. The proposal also states that the exception seeking to protect commercial interests will not apply to information on emissions. A separate mention is, therefore, made on intellectual property rights. At the same time the Commission has decided to include a new exception aimed at protecting procedures leading to the selection of staff or of contracting parties. Consultation with Third Parties: a new Article has been introduced that lays down the procedure to be followed where access is requested for documents originating from a Member State. The Member State must be consulted unless it is clear that the documents shall or shall not be disclosed. In cases where the Member State gives reasons for not disclosing the requested documents – or on relevant similar and specific rules in its national legislation, the institution will deny access to these documents. Procedural rules: the Commission proposes to extend the time limit for handling a confirmatory application to thirty working days, with a possibility for a further extension by 15 working days. Experience shows that it is almost impossible to handle a confirmatory application within 15 working days. A new paragraph has been added to Article 10 clarifying that, where specific modalities for access are laid in EU or national law, these must be respected. Active Dissemination : provisions relating to active dissemination have been redrafted in order to grant direct access to documents, which are part of procedures leading to the adoption of EU legislative acts or non-legislative acts of general application. Such documents should be made accessible by the institutions from the outset, unless an exception to the public right access clearly applies."

Emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan""""",0.368,0.608,0.789,0.226,0.212,0.771,0.164,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to introduce emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: against the background of the unprecedented and devastating floods in Pakistan in July and August 2010, the European Council at its meeting on 16 September mandated Ministers to agree urgently a comprehensive package of short, medium and longer term measures which will help underpin Pakistan's recovery and future development. These should, inter alia, include ambitious trade measures granting, exclusively to Pakistan, increased market access to the EU through the immediate and time limited reduction of duties on key imports from Pakistan. The European Council invited the Commission to present in October a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to unilaterally suspend duties on certain imports from Pakistan for a limited period of time. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal extends autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan by suspending for a limited period of time all tariffs for certain products of export interest to Pakistan. The provision of these trade preferences would not cause any meaningful adverse effects on the domestic market of the Union and would not affect negatively least developed Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 60% of Pakistan's exports to the EU are textiles and clothing. Consequently, a large number of products proposed for liberalisation are textiles and clothing. Yet, since the product scope should be as broad as possible, it also includes other industrial and agricultural products in order not to undermine Pakistan's efforts to diversify its industries and exports base. A list of 75 dutiable products lines of importance for Pakistan's exports has been established. The selected product lines amount to almost €900 million in import value, accounting for about 27% of EU imports from Pakistan (€3.3 billion). Liberalising these 75 lines, of which one product line (ethanol) would be subject to an annual tariff rate quota of 100 000 tonnes based on past imports, would result in an estimated increase in EU imports from Pakistan of around €100 million per year compared to 2009, while lowering tariff revenue for the EU budget by slightly more than €80 million. The autonomous trade preferences will be either in the form of an exemption from customs duties upon import in the Union or in the form of tariff-rate quotas. Entitlement to benefit from the autonomous trade preferences is conditional on Pakistan's compliance with the relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto as well as involvement in effective administrative cooperation with the Union in order to prevent any risk of fraud. Given the urgency of the situation in Pakistan, the Regulation should apply as of 1 January 2011, provided that the WTO has approved the request from the Union for the waiver from its obligations under GATT Articles I and XIII. In order to ensure an immediate and sustainable impact on the economic recovery of Pakistan in the aftermath of the floods it is recommended to limit the duration of the trade preferences until 31 December 2013. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: the proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue. In total the gross loss in customs duties amounts to €82.4 million, while the net loss would be 25% lower (Member States' collection costs) at €61.8 million. These figures build on the assumption that Pakistan currently fully makes use of its preferential access to the EU market."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union is a party to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution as well as to the 1999 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-Level Ozone ('the Gothenburg Protocol'). The parties to the Gothenburg Protocol opened negotiations with a view to improving further the protection of human health and the environment, including through the establishment of new emission reduction obligations for selected air pollutants to be achieved by the year 2020 and the updating of emission limit values addressing emissions of air pollutants at source. In 2012, the Protocol was modified and two new annexes added. The Amendments set out in Decision 2012/1 entered into force and became effective on the basis of the expedited procedure provided for in the Gothenburg Protocol. The Amendment set out in Decision 2012/2 requires acceptance by the Parties to the Gothenburg Protocol. The Union has already adopted instruments on matters covered by the Amendment. This last one should now be approved.

The proposed Amendment to the 1999 protocol sets out new national emission reduction commitments for 2020 onwards. It covers four air pollutants: sulphur, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds (VOC) other than methane, and particulate matter. In particular, the amendment includes: (i) emission reductions for black carbon; (ii) an update of the emission limit values set in the annex to the protocol; (iii) new standards on the content of non-methane VOC's in products."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The withdrawal shall occur during the programming period 2014-2020 in which the United Kingdom is participating in fifteen programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal ('cooperation programmes'). Two of those programmes are programmes involving Northern Ireland and supporting peace and reconciliation and North-South cooperation under the ‘Good Friday Agreement’ that the Union intends to continue even if the United Kingdom withdraws from the Union without a withdrawal agreement having entered into force by the date the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. CONTENT: this proposal aims to ensure the continuation of two bilateral cooperation programmes involving Ireland namely: (i) the PEACE IV (Ireland-United Kingdom) programme and; (ii) the United Kingdom-Ireland (Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland) programme. Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 shall continue to apply to the cooperation programmes subject to the provisions of this Regulation. By way of derogation from Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013: - the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) hosting the managing authority and the certifying authority of the PEACE IV (Ireland-United Kingdom) and the United Kingdom - Ireland (Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland) Programmes shall continue to exercise its functions; - the Department of Finance of Northern Ireland shall remain the audit authority of these programmes. The Regulation shall apply from the date following the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. It shall not apply if a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposed Regulation has no financial implications. Both programmes shall continue to be financed from the Union’s budget. The possibility to execute the necessary controls and audits in all participating regions will need to be confirmed by an agreement between the Commission and the authorities of the United Kingdom and will constitute a condition for financing."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. CONTENT: the EU's policy towards the countries of the Western Balkans is defined within the Stabilisation and Association Process launched in May 1999. At its meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council concluded that Stabilisation and Association Agreements with Western Balkan countries should be preceded by asymmetrical trade liberalisation. Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introduced exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the Stabilisation and Association process. Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 applies until 31 December 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina: since the launch of the Stabilisation and Association Process, Stabilisation and Association Agreements have been concluded between the Union and all concerned Western Balkan countries, with the exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised as a potential candidate country for EU accession in 2003 and signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement in 2008, agreeing to the EU’s conditions for membership. Since then, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters with Bosnia and Herzegovina applies, pending the finalisation of the ratification process of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Having regard to differences in the scope of the tariff liberalisation under the contractual regimes which have been developed between the Union and all participants to the Stabilisation and Association process and the preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, it is suggested to prolong the duration of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 until 31 December 2020, so as to give the beneficiaries of the exceptional trade measures and the European Union sufficient time to align, where appropriate, preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 with those provided for under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements. Consequences of the enlargement of the EU to Croatia: Bosnia and Herzegovina have not yet accepted to adapt trade concessions granted under the Interim Agreement in order to take into account the preferential traditional trade between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). In case Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union do not find an agreement on the adaptation of trade concessions, preferences granted to Bosnia and Herzegovina under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 should be suspended as of 1 January 2016. Once Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union have signed and applied provisionally an agreement on the adaptation of trade concessions in the Interim Agreement, these preferences will be reestablished. Human Rights : Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 does not provide any possibility to temporarily suspend the grant of exceptional trade measures in case of serious and systematic violations of the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by its beneficiaries. It is appropriate to introduce such possibility, so as to ensure that swift action can be taken in case serious and systematic violations of the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law would occur in one of the countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process. Wine originating in Montenegro : lastly, a technical adjustment regarding Montenegro's access to the additional global quota for wine imports is included."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Regulation (EC) N° 261/2004 and Regulation (EC) N° 2027/97). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 on air carrier liability in respect of the carriage of passengers and their baggage by air have significantly contributed to protecting the rights of air passengers when their travel plans are disrupted by denied boarding, long delays, cancellations or mishandled baggage. A number of shortcomings revealed during the implementation of the rights under the Regulations have, however, prevented their full potential in terms of passenger protection from being realised. In order to ensure a more effective, efficient and consistent application of air passenger rights across the Union, a series of adjustments to the current legal framework is required. This was underlined in the Commission’s 2010 EU Citizenship Report on dismantling obstacles to EU citizens' rights, which announced measures to ensure a set of common rights, notably for air passengers, and the adequate enforcement of these rights. In its resolution of 29 March 2012, the European Parliament considered that proper application of the existing rules by Member States and air carriers, enforcement of sufficient means of redress and providing passengers with accurate information concerning their rights should be the cornerstones of regaining passengers’ trust. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission evaluated four options: Option 1 : focus on economic incentives (moderate change of enforcement); Option 2 : balance stronger enforcement policy with economic incentives: ·  Variant 2a : increasing the time threshold after which the passenger has a right to compensation in case of delays from the current three hours to at least five; ·  Variant 2b : extending the scope of ""extraordinary circumstances"" to include most technical defaults; Option 3 : focus on stronger enforcement and clarify passenger rights; Option 4 : centralised enforcement. The impact assessment concludes that option 2 is preferable to the others, as it would most effectively and efficiently enhance passengers' rights while taking into account the financial impact on the air transport sector. Variant 2a is slightly preferred to 2b. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to promote the interest of air passengers by ensuring that air carriers comply with a high level of air passenger protection during travel disruptions, while taking into account the financial implications for the air transport sector and ensuring that air carriers operate under harmonised conditions in a liberalised market. In concrete terms, the proposal: ·  clarifies the definition of ""extraordinary circumstances in line with the European Court's decision in the case C-549/07 (Wallentin-Herman) i.e. circumstances which, by their nature or origin, are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned and are beyond its actual control; ·  increases the time threshold after which the right to compensation arises from three to five hours for all journeys within the EU. For journeys to/from third countries, the threshold will be dependent upon the distance of the journey: (i) 5 hours for outside-EU journeys of 3500 km or less; (ii) 9 hours for outside–EU journeys between 3500 and 6000 km, and (iii) 12 hours for outside-EU journeys of 6000 km and more; ·  stipulates that if the air carrier cannot reroute the passenger on its own services within 12 hours, it must consider other carriers or other transport modes, subject to seat availability; ·  introduces a single time threshold for care of 2 hours for flights of all distances; ·  confirms that passengers that miss a flight connection because their previous flight was delayed have a right to care and, under certain circumstances, a right to compensation. However, such right would only apply where the connecting flights are part of a single contract of carriage; ·  confirms that passengers of flights rescheduled with a notice of period of less than two weeks in advance of the originally scheduled time have similar rights to delayed passengers; ·  clearly sets out the rights of passengers when their aircraft is delayed on the tarmac, in particular a right to disembark after five hours; ·  provides that passengers should have a right to information about the flight disruption as soon as the information is available; ·  clarifies the role of the National Enforcement Bodies (NEBs), and extends their role to the monitoring of compliance with the baggage provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2027/97, and also enhances the exchange of information and the coordination between the NEBs, and between the NEBs and the Commission; ·  requires air carriers to inform passengers, at the time of reservation, about their claim and complaint handling procedures, and provide electronic means to submit complaints. Airlines will be required to respond to passengers within two months. Lastly, the proposal ensures better enforcement of passenger rights with regard to mishandled baggage: (i) passengers with reduced mobility should have the same right to free movement, and non-discrimination as other citizens; (ii) increased liability of air carriers with regard to mobility equipment up to the actual value of the equipment; (iii) enhanced transparency with regard to baggage allowances; (iv) measures with regard to musical instruments; (v) require air carriers to issue a claim form at the airport where passengers can complain about delayed, damaged or lost baggage BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road vehicles (the Clean Vehicles Directive) makes it mandatory to account for operational lifetime energy and environmental impact in the public procurement of road transport vehicles. An ex-post evaluation carried out in 2015 showed that the Directive has serious shortcomings (e.g. limited scope, lack of definition, inaccuracy or extreme complexity of the provisions on the purchase of vehicles). So far, public bodies have only purchased small volumes of clean vehicles. Public procurement remains relevant as a demand-side stimulus, including in the field of heavy-duty transport vehicles where no legislative requirement for reducing CO2 emissions exists yet. This is why the Commission is presenting a new initiative to increase the market uptake of clean vehicles in the context of public procurement. Currently, the uptake is very low: in 2017, in 16 Member States the proportion of battery-electric vehicles in new car registrations was less than 1%, and in 10 Member States it was less than 0.5%. The proposal builds on the Commission's European strategy for low-emission mobility, adopted in July 2016. It confirms that, in order to meet the commitments made by the EU at COP21 held in Paris in 2015, the decarbonisation of the transport sector must be accelerated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is to introduce a definition of clean vehicles based on emission thresholds and setting up minimum procurement target for light-duty vehicles and combining it with a definition based on alternative fuels and setting up minimum procurement targets for heavy-duty vehicles. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to revise the Clean Vehicle Directive to ensure that the Directive covers all relevant procurement practices, provides for clear and long-term market signals and that provisions are simplified and effective. The proposal is limited to the establishment of a common policy framework with minimum requirements for the award of contracts for clean vehicles, while leaving Member States flexibility in terms of implementation, including in the choice of technology. In concrete terms, the proposed revision: extends the scope of the Directive to forms of public procurement other than purchasing, namely the leasing, rental or hire-purchase and to public service contracts for public road transport, special purpose road services, non-scheduled passenger transport and bus and coach hire; sets a definition for clean light-duty vehicles based on a combined CO2 and air pollutant emissions threshold; sets, in terms of public procurement for clean vehicles, minimum targets differentiated by Member State and segmented by vehicle category according to both CO2 emission thresholds and air pollutants (light-duty vehicles) and the use of alternative fuels (heavy-duty vehicles), as included in the Annex and set from the dates mentioned therein; introduces a framework for reporting and follow-up : the first intermediate reporting in 2023 and full reporting in 2026 on the implementation of the targets for 2025 and every three years thereafter. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to update provisions for CO2 emission standards of heavy duty vehicles once the related heavy-duty CO2 emission performance standards are in force at Union level."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the implementation of the Slot Regulation has significantly improved slot allocation at busy European airports in terms of neutrality and transparency, making a major contribution to the creation of the internal market in aviation. Nowadays, however, there is much more competition. Since 1992, the number of intra-EU routes operated has more than doubled and there has been a 150 % increase in long-haul flights departing from European airports. In 1992, just 93 European routes were served by more than two airlines. In 2010 there were 479 such routes. The slot-allocation system established in 1993 does not ensure the optimum allocation and use of slots and thus of airport capacity. As highlighted by Eurocontrol and ACI-Europe, one of the key challenges facing Europe is airport congestion. According to Eurocontrol's Long Term Forecast in December 2010, even taking into account currently planned infrastructure enhancements, as much as 10% of demand for air transport will remain unmet in 2030 due to a shortage of airport capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to review the Slot Regulation to determine to what extent it can be improved with a view to matching capacity to demand for air transport in all sectors (long-haul, regional, cargo, etc.). This initiative is one of the actions necessary for the Single European Transport Area as described in the Commission's White Paper: Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area — Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system. It is also part of the airport package of measures identified as a strategic initiative in the 2011 Commission Work Programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three packages is as follows: · the first policy package included measures to improve the effectiveness of slot allocation and the use of slots, without changing the administrative nature of the current system; · the second package incorporated the elements of the first package but added several more, including market-based mechanisms (in the form of explicit provision for secondary trading across the EU). It also included several pro-competitive proposals, such as revision of the new entrant rule and making the criteria for granting priority for allocation of a slot for the following season (so-called grandfather rights) slightly stricter; · the third package comprised all elements of the second package, but took the market-based mechanism a step further by withdrawing 'grandfather' or 'historical' slots and having them auctioned. The Commission recommended that the second package be implemented as its benefits would be considerably higher than the costs incurred. For the 2012-25 period, the package was estimated to result in an average annual increase of 1.6 % (or 23.8 million) in the number of passengers carried, a net economic benefit of EUR 5.3 billion, as well as a significant increase in employment (up to 62 000 full-time jobs). LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 (2) TFEU. CONTENT: the main points of the proposal are as follows : 1) Introduction of the possibility for secondary trade in slots and increased competition · in order to encourage greater slot mobility, the proposal expressly allows airlines to buy and sell slots ; · it is also proposed to broaden the definition of 'new entrant', to help facilitate the growth of sustainable competitors and reduce the schedule fragmentation that occurs when slots are allocated to a larger number of airlines unable to translate these slots into a viable alternative to dominant carriers. 2) Strengthening the transparency of the slot allocation process and the independence of slot coordinators: the proposal: · contains a number of provisions to ensure that the slot allocation process is supported by a sufficient degree of transparency; · will allow stricter criteria for the independence of the coordinators with regard to any interested party to be defined; · advocates enhanced cooperation between the coordinators, initially through the development of common projects covering, for instance, the development of common slot allocation software or even merging the coordination activities for airports situated in different Member States. On the basis of progress made, the Commission could eventually propose, at a later stage, the creation of a European coordinator responsible for slot allocation at all European Union airports. 3) Integration of slot allocation with the reform of the European air traffic management system (Single European Sky): the proposal aims to make an important contribution to strengthening the management of the aviation network at European level by associating the European Network Manager with the slot allocation process: · the Commission may request a capacity analysis at an airport, should the network manager deem this necessary for ensuring coherence with the airport operational plan. Such capacity analyses would be carried out in accordance with standards agreed at European level; · the Commission could make recommendations to the Member State on the capacity assessment if the network manager suggests that it does not fully take into account the needs of the European network; · the proposal also introduces a new category of airport: the 'network airport'. Such airports are not coordinated, but are identified as important since they may offer alternatives during times of network disruption. Thus, the proposal provides that coordinators gather information on the operations at these airports. 4) Amendment of the '80-20' rule and definition of a series of slots and resort to the airport charge system to discourage the late return of slots to the pool: · in order for airlines to be granted priority for the allocation of a given slot in the next corresponding scheduling season, they need to have used at least 85 % of the allocated series of slots (instead of 80 % at present); · the minimum series length (i.e. the minimum number of weekly slots required for priority allocation for the following corresponding season) is raised from 5 to 15 for the summer season and 10 for the winter season. Exceptions are provided for certain types of traffic (charter) to take the characteristics of regional airports into account; · lastly, to ensure that slots reserved prior to the start of an operating season are in fact operated as planned by airlines, the proposal would authorise airports to use an airport charge system to dissuade air carriers from belatedly returning slots to the pool. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union has been a Contracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (the ICCAT Convention) since 14 November 1997, following the adoption of Council Decision 86/238/EEC. The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation in the conservation and management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas through the establishment of an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the adoption by the latter of conservation and management measures which become binding on the contracting parties. In 1998, ICCAT adopted resolution 98-18 concerning the unreported and unregulated catches of tuna by large-scale longline vessels in the Convention area. Following the adoption of resolution 98-18, ICCAT identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels. As a consequence, ICCAT recommended that Contracting Parties take appropriate measures, consistent with provisions of the 1998 Resolution, to the effect that the import of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products in any form from the above mentioned countries be prohibited. As a consequence, imports to the Union of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating from these countries were prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 827/2004. In 2004, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations for the lifting of trade-restrictive measures against those three countries. As a consequence, Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 was amended by Regulation (EC) No 919/2005, so that it continued prohibiting such imports only from Bolivia and Georgia. At its 22nd regular annual meeting, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made and actions taken by Bolivia and Georgia and adopted recommendation 11-19 lifting the import prohibitions on Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products which had been imposed on those two countries. Regulation (EC) No 827/2004, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 919/2005 should therefore be repealed. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the lifting of the import prohibitions on Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products that were imposed on Bolivia and Georgia has been adopted by ICCAT, international body to which the European Union is a Contracting Party. In order to uphold its international commitments, the European Union should enact such decision into Union law and therefore repeal Regulation (EC) No 827/2004. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the European Union’s budget."

This proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.
3355EP7,"""""Implementation of the agreements concluded by the EU following negotiations in the framework of Article XXVIII of GATT 1994""""",0.825,0.934,0.053,0.645,0.485,0.916,0.867,0.143,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to implement the agreement on imports concluded between the European Union and Brazil and Thailand respectively in order to deal with the problem of potential substitution effects in the import of poultry. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: negotiations under Article XXVIII of GATT 1994 concluded on poultry in 2007 covered tariff lines on poultry meat under heading 0210 as well as one processed poultry line, 1602 32 19 in the EC Schedule CXL: cooked preparations containing more than 57% of poultry meat. Limiting the negotiations to the processed poultry line 1602 32 19 was considered to sufficiently prevent potential substitution effects. Subsequent import data, however, showed a dramatic import surge of processed poultry meat under tariff line 1602 32 30: preparations containing 25% or more but less than 57% by weight of poultry meat or offal. This indicated that exporters seemed to take advantage of a relative gap in the EU level of protection, substituting poultry preparations containing more than 57% of poultry meat with preparations containing less than 57%, under tariff line 1602 32 30. Comparable substitution effects were to be expected under other 1602 tariff lines in the future. In order comprehensively to address these substitution effects affecting the EU poultry industry, the Commission requested from the Council the authorisation to renegotiate the concessions on poultry meat under Chapter 16 of the CN. The Commission has negotiated with the Federal Republic of Brazil and with the Kingdom of Thailand, each holding principal supplying interests and/or substantial interests in various of the tariff lines concerned. The negotiations have resulted in Agreements in the form of exchanges of letters initialled with Thailand on 22 November 2011 and with Brazil on 7 December 2011. The agreements were negotiated on the basis of the Combined Nomenclature codes in force at the time. In the newest version of Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff as laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1006/2011 published in OJ L 282 of 28 October 2011, the tariff lines 1602 39 40 and 1602 39 80 have been merged into a new tariff line 1602 39 85. It is therefore appropriate to reflect this new situation in the present implementing regulation. The autonomous Customs duty rates for the tariff lines covered by the negotiations are currently set at levels below the new conventional duty rates resulting from the modification of concessions pursuant to Article XXVIII of GATT 1994. However, under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff, the autonomous customs duties apply when they are below the conventional duties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) TFEU. CONTENT: following the negotiations opened under Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 in mid-2009 with Brazil and Thailand, this proposal concerns the implementation of the Agreements between the European Union and Brazil and Thailand respectively in order to deal with the problem of l substitution effects in the import of poultry. The implementation of the Agreements concern : an increase in the out-of-quota rates for 7 tariff lines of processed poultry meat products, and, opening TRQs for the same 7 tariff lines of processed poultry meat products, for Brazil, Thailand and other countries. This proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a Council decision regarding the conclusion of agreements between the European Union and Brazil and Thailand respectively in order to deal with the problem of substitution effects in the import of poultry. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the import volume of the quota is similar to the quantity imported prior to this agreement. There is no effect on the internal market balance that could lead to needs for market instruments. In case of import of the total quota under this draft regulation, it can be estimated that the measure could involve a reduction of own resources of an approximated net amount of EUR 1.4 million, after deduction of 25% of collection costs by Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the EU and Norway are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) which provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. Article 19 of the EEA Agreement provides that the contracting Parties undertake to continue their efforts to achieve progressive liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. The previous agreement in the form of an exchange of letters liberalising trade in agricultural products between Norway and the European Union was signed on 15 April 2011. It provided for mutual tariff rate quotas and reductions in duty. It also included an undertaking by the Parties to resume bilateral negotiations in two years’ time. The 2011 EU-Norway bilateral agricultural trade agreement increased the duty-free access of EU agricultural products to the Norwegian market to around 60 % of trade. Therefore, the latest round of negotiations aimed at: (i) increasing the degree of liberalisation on both sides; (ii) increasing the current tariff rate quotas; and (iii) opening new tariff rate quotas for additional agricultural products; (iv) addressing certain pending trade irritants. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Norway concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products. The Agreement provides for further trade preferences for trade in agricultural products, including additional fully liberalised tariff lines. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy, vegetables and ornamental plants, additional or new tariff quotas have been agreed upon. The deepening of trade relations with Norway fits into the overall context of EU trade policy and is beneficial for the EU since the EU is a net exporter of basic agricultural products to Norway. The main products exported by the EU are wines and vinegar, animal feed, soya and colza oil, live plants and cheese. Imports into the EU from Norway are mainly soybean, animal and vegetable oils and their residues, fur skins and undenatured ethyl alcohol. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this Agreement will have no impact on the expenditure side of the EU budget. The new concessions granted on imports from Norway will likely result in a reduction of own resources through a lower collection of customs duties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since 1984, EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit when a directive (Directive 1984/253/EEC) harmonised the procedures for the approval of auditors. Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, was adopted in 2006 and considerably broadened the scope of the former Directive. The financial crisis has highlighted weaknesses in the statutory audit especially with regard to Public-Interest Entities (PIE), such as banks insurance companies and listed companies. Given that many banks revealed huge losses from 2007 to 2009 on the positions they had held both on and off balance sheet, it is difficult for many citizens and investors to understand how auditors could give clean audit reports to their clients (in particular banks) for those periods. Statutory auditors and audit firms play an important role in society. They are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits of public-interest entities with a view to enhancing the degree of confidence of the public in the annual and consolidated financial statements of such entities. In view of the public interest, better audit quality would contribute to the orderly functioning of markets by enhancing the integrity and efficiency of financial statements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment resulted in the following preferred policy options: · the scope of statutory audit should be clarified and specified and the information that the auditor provides to users, the audited entities, audit committees and supervisors improved; · the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services to the audited entities and even the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services in general would effectively address the need to reinforce independence and professional scepticism. Moreover, stricter rules in the procedure for the appointment of auditors and the introduction of mandatory audit firm rotation would contribute to higher quality audits; · in order to facilitate an objective choice of an audit provider, contractual clauses limiting audit firm choice should be prohibited, the transparency on audit quality and on audit firms should be increased and an audit quality certification should be established; · ownership restrictions should be lifted in order to increase the choice of audit providers; · national audit supervisory authorities should be strengthened and an EU-wide cooperation within the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should be set up. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal lays down conditions for carrying out the statutory audit on the financial statements of PIEs. Directive 2006/43/EC already deals with certain requirements which apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. Those requirements will no longer be comprised in the Directive, but integrated (and further developed) in this Regulation. The main points are as follows: Conditions for carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities : · an auditor should establish adequate policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Regulation regarding independence, internal quality control systems and the supervision of employees; · former auditors, key audit partners or their employees are not allowed to take up a key management position in the audited entity, to become a member of the audit committee of the audited entity, to become a non-executive member of the administrative body or to join the supervisory body of the audited entity within two years after the termination of the audit engagement; · the statutory auditor, audit firm or member of the audit firm's network will be prevented from providing certain non-audit services to their audited entities. For other non-services that are not fundamentally incompatible with the audit services, the audit committee or the competent authority will be empowered to assess whether or not they may be provided to the audited entity; · audit firms of significant size should focus their professional activity on the carrying out of statutory audit and should not be allowed to undertake non- audit services; · the content of the audit report disclosed to the public is expanded so that it: (i) explains the methodology used, especially how much of the balance sheet has been directly verified and how much has been based on system and compliance testing, the levels of materiality applied to perform the audit, the key areas of risk of material misstatements of the financial statements; (ii) explains whether the statutory audit was designed to detect fraud and, (iii) in the event of a qualified or adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, explain the reasons for such a decision; · the auditor should also prepare a longer and more detailed report for the audit committee. This report would provide more detailed information on the audit carried out, on the situation of the undertaking as such (e. g. going concern) and the findings of the audit combined with the necessary explanations; · the auditor should keep certain documents and information for a period of five years. The appointment of statutory auditors or audit firms by public-interest entities: · in order to reinforce the independence and capacity of the audit committee, the latter should be composed of non-executive members, at least one member should have experience and knowledge in auditing and another one in accounting and/or auditing; · the proposal for the appointment of the auditor to the meeting of shareholders should be based on a recommendation of the audit committee. Unless it concerns the renewal of an audit engagement, the recommendation should contain at least two choices (excluding the incumbent auditor) and the audit committee should express a justified preference for one of them. The recommendation of the audit committee should be made after the completion of a due tendering process; · the proposal introduces mandatory rotation of audit firms after a maximum period of 6 years that may be, under certain exceptional circumstances, extended to 8 years; · where a public-interest entity has appointed two or more statutory auditors or audit firms, the maximum duration of the engagements will be 9 years; on an exceptional basis, such duration may be extended to 12 years. It also provides for a cooling-off period before the audit firm is able to carry out the statutory audit of the same entity again. Surveillance of the activities of auditors and audit firms carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities: · each Member State should designate a competent authority responsible for the supervision of auditors and audit firms auditing PIEs. The proposal requires that the EU-wide cooperation between competent authorities takes place within ESMA; · a 'voluntary' pan-European audit quality certification is introduced to increase the visibility, recognition and reputation of all audit firms having capacities to conduct high quality audits of PIEs. ESMA should publish the requirements for obtaining the certificate along with any administrative and fee implications. Supervisory measures and penalties: administrative pecuniary sanctions on auditors and PIEs for identified violations are envisaged. Authorities should be transparent about the sanctions and measures they apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no direct or indirect impact on the European Union budget. In particular, tasks that would be entrusted to EU supervisory bodies as mentioned in the proposal would not entail additional EU funding. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
8195EP8,"""""Temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders""""",0.014,0.054,0.86,0.333,0.077,0.821,0.859,0.673,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to update the Schengen Borders Code to adapt the rules for the reintroduction of temporary internal border controls to the current needs to respond to evolving and persistent serious threats to public policy or internal security. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the secondary movements of irregular migrants and the increase of cross-border terrorist threats posing a serious threat to the internal security of a number of Schengen States, some Members States have been compelled to extend the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls. Based on the current Schengen rules, border controls at internal borders are possible for longer than six months when there are serious deficiencies in the external border management of a Member State, as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation. In situations where the serious threat to public policy or internal security is not related to deficiencies in the management of the external borders as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation, the reintroduction of border control at internal borders is subject to the conditions and time limits set out in the Schengen Borders Code. While the current rules for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls have proved sufficient in the vast majority of cases, the maximum periods laid down in the legislation may not be sufficient when Member States face serious and persistent threats to public order or internal security. This is why the Commission considers it necessary to adapt the maximum periods for the temporary reintroduction of border checks to current needs, while ensuring that the use of this measure remains exceptional and is decided only as a last resort. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to update the Schengen Borders Code to prolong the time limits for internal border controls. Stronger procedural safeguards are also being introduced to ensure that border controls at internal borders remain an exception - a measure of last resort - and are used only if necessary and proportionate, limiting the impact on free movement. The Commission proposes: to increase up to one year (instead of six months) the maximum time limit for temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat and to increase from up to 30 days to up to six months the limit for the length of prolongation periods; to introduce better procedural safeguards in order to ensure that the decision on temporary border control at internal borders or their prolongation is based on a proper risk assessment and is taken in cooperation with the other Member States concerned. Member States will prepare and submit a risk assessment assessing how long the identified threat is expected to persist and which sections of the internal borders are affected and how border control contributed to address the identified threat; to introduce a better follow up to the opinion of the Commission expressing concerns on the necessity or proportionality of border controls being exercised for longer than six months and the consultation procedure involving the Commission, Member States and, as now proposed, relevant Agencies; a new possibility is introduced to extend internal border controls by a maximum period of two years where the serious threat to internal security or public policy persists beyond the one-year deadline , provided that it can be attributed to the same grounds (e.g. threat related to the operation of a cross-border terrorist network) and that commensurate exceptional national measures are taken within the territory to address the threat (such as the state of emergency). Such prolongation would require a Recommendation of the Council, which would need to take into account the opinion given by the Commission, and would be strictly limited to 6 month periods with the possibility to prolong no more than three times up to a maximum period of two years."

989EP8,"""""European Fund for Strategic Investments """"",0.543,0.851,0.54,0.021,0.058,0.642,0.853,0.019,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish the European Fund for Strategic Investments aiming to mobilise funding for projects of at least EUR 315 billion to help promote growth and employment. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis, the level of investment in the EU has dropped by about 15% since its peak in 2007. General uncertainty about the economic situation, high levels of public and private debt in parts of the EU economy and their impact on credit risk limit the room for manoeuvre. However, significant levels of savings and high levels of financial liquidity exist. The President of the European Commission in his Political Guidelines for the Commission 2014-2019 identified the Investment Plan for Europe as a key policy challenge, as did the European Council on 18 December 2014. The Plan is based on three mutually reinforcing strands: 1) the mobilisation of at least EUR 315 billion in additional investment over the next three years, maximising the impact of public resources and unlocking private investment; 2) targeted initiatives to make sure that this extra investment meets the needs of the real economy; 3) measures to provide greater regulatory predictability and to remove barriers to investment, making Europe more attractive and thereby multiplying the impact of the Plan. The European Council also invited the Union legislators to agree on the necessary legal text by June, so that the new investments could be activated as early as mid-2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes comprises the following elements : Creation of a European Fund for Strategic Investments : the Commission shall conclude an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in order to support investments in the Union and to ensure increased access to financing for companies having up to 3000 employees, with a particular focus on small and medium enterprises, through the supply of risk bearing capacity to the EIB. Participation in the EFSI should be open to third parties, including Member States, national promotional banks or public agencies owned or controlled by Member States, private sector entities and entities outside the Union subject to the consent of existing contributors. Governance of the EFSI : a Steering Board shall determine the strategic orientation, the strategic asset allocation and operating policies and procedures, including the investment policy of projects that EFSI can support and the risk profile of the EFSI; an Investment Committee, consisting of independent professionals, shall be responsible for examining potential operations and approving the support for operations irrespective of the geographic location of the project concerned. European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH) : building on existing EIB and Commission advisory services, the EIAH shall provide advisory support for investment project identification, preparation and development and act as a single technical advisory hub (including on legal issues) for project financing within the EU. Granting of an EU Guarantee and Establishment of an EU Guarantee Fund : the proposal creates an initial EU guarantee of EUR 16 billion for EIB financing and investment operations. Those operations need to support: development of infrastructure; investment in education, health, research, development, information and communications technology and innovation; expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency; or infrastructure projects in the environmental, natural resources, urban development and social fields; SMEs and mid cap companies including by providing working capital risk financing. The support can be provided directly from the EIB or through the European Investment Fund. A transparent European investment project pipeline : a stumbling block to greater investment levels within the EU is a lack of knowledge of ongoing and future investment projects within the Union. The proposal also provides for the creation of a European investment project pipeline as a means to ensure that information on potential projects is transparent and available to investors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EU guarantee provided for the EFSI amounts to EUR 16 billion. The proposal establishes a guarantee fund which is intended to provide a liquidity cushion for the Union budget against losses incurred by the EFSI in pursuit of its objectives. However, for an initial period, EUR 8bn will be provided only via payments from the budget. From 2016 onwards, these payments from the budget will gradually build up the endowment of the Fund and should reach an accumulated sum of EUR 8bn by 2020 (EUR 1.35 billion in 2015, EUR 2.03 billion in 2016, EUR 2.641 billion in 2017 and EUR 1.979 billion in 2018). However, two actions will create costs for the EIB for which the beneficiaries cannot be charged: The European Investment Advisory Hub will primarily be funded from existing envelopes for EIB technical assistance under existing EU programmes (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020…). However, additional funding of up to a maximum of EUR 20 million per year (EUR 10 million in 2015) may be necessary and will be budgeted in consequence. Any potential costs for the project pipeline will also be covered; The EIB will incur administrative expenses for increasing its financing via the European Investment Fund to small and medium enterprises. This will require the payment of fees in the order of an accumulated total of EUR 105 million, around EUR 48 million of which until 2020. Operational appropriations required by this proposal are to be fully financed within the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
