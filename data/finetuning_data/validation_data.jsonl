PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid \"in beneficiary countries\", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the EIDHR and on the parallel proposal amending the DCI."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 2378EP7, ECR%:0.789, EPP%:0.842, EFD/IDG%:0.548, Greens/EFA%:0.895, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.867, S&D%:0.8, The Left%:0.057, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the consequences of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for farmers and rural businesses are unprecedented. Mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments have led to economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances. CONTENT: the proposal includes limited and targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 providing exceptional and temporary support to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, which are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Exceptional temporary support Support under this measure shall consist of temporary emergency aid to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis to ensure the continuity of their activities. It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 1353EP9, ECR%:1.016, EPP%:0.973, EFD/IDG%:0.836, Greens/EFA%:0.919, NI%:0.649, REG%:0.935, S&D%:0.929, The Left%:0.927, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUD: in a crisis where EUR 4 588.9 billion of taxpayer money was committed to support banks between October 2008 and October 2009 and where such aid accounted for 39% of EU 27 GDP in 2009, all components of the financial system need to be improved. Robust audit is key to re-establishing trust and market confidence. It contributes to investor protection by providing easily accessible, cost-effective and trustworthy information about the financial statements of companies. It also potentially reduces the cost of capital for audited companies by ensuring more transparency and reliability of financial statements. It is also important to stress that auditors are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits. EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit through Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts. However, the high degree of concentration in audit market and the multitude of approval procedures necessary to provide cross-border statutory audits prevent small and medium-sized audit firms from benefiting from the internal market. The following problems are examined: \u00a7  a high level of administrative burden resulting from fragmented national regulation; \u00a7  the provision of cross-border statutory audits is allowed only if an auditor passes an aptitude test and gets approved and registered in every Member State; \u00a7  a lack of common standards across the EU on audit practice, independence, internal control of audit firms; \u00a7  auditing standards do not take into account the size of the audited companies, in particular of SMEs; \u00a7  associated problems regarding supervision of non-PIEs. This proposal on amending Directive 2006/43/EC aims to improve the internal market on statutory audits. It will coexist with a proposal for a regulation on the specific requirements on the statutory audit of public-interest entities. The two proposals are part of the ongoing regulatory reform in various domains of the financial sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment concluded that the best options to improve the existing situation would be: \u00a7  facilitation of the cross-border recognition of audit providers' competence; \u00a7  streamlining of the standards on audit practice, independence and internal control of audit firms across the Union; \u00a7  adaptation of audit standards to the size of the audited entity by requesting Member States to ensure that a proportionate and simplified audit for SMEs is possible. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal contains amendments to the provisions on the approval and registration of auditors and audit firms, on the existing principles in Directive 2006/43/EC regarding professional ethics, professional secrecy, independence and reporting as well as the associated supervision rules that remain applicable for the audit of non-public-interest entities (non- PIEs). The main modifications to the Directive are: Articulation between the Directive and an additional legal instrument on specific requirements for the statutory audit of PIEs : the proposal deals with the applicability of the amended Directive to the statutory audit of PIEs. Certain provisions apply to statutory auditors and audit firms, irrespective of the type of audited entity. However, for the rest of the Articles of the Directive, the situation is different: clauses on independence and objectivity, audit fees, audit reporting, quality assurance, investigations and penalties would not apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. On these specific issues more detailed rules would be enacted in the Regulation. Definition of \"statutory audit\" in order to take account of the new Accountancy Directive : the new definition will continue to cover the instances where different Union legal texts impose an obligation on some undertakings to have their financial statements audited, depending on their legal form or on their activity. In order to guarantee the \u201cunicity\u201d of audit, the definition of \"statutory audit\" should also cover situations where Member States decide to impose an obligation on small undertakings to have their financial statements audited. Lastly, where a small undertaking decides voluntarily to have its financial statements audited, such audit should also be considered a statutory audit. Modification of the ownership rules : currently, the Directive requires that a majority of the voting rights in an audit firm is held by licensed accountant practitioners. This requirement is no longer stipulated in the proposed amendment and Member States are forbidden to require that a minimum of capital or of voting rights in an audit firm is held by statutory auditors or audit firms. However, the proposal maintains the existing requirement that a majority of the members of the administrative or management body of the audit firm are audit firms or statutory auditors. Passport for audit firms : the proposal for an amended Directive would allow audit firms to provide statutory audits in Member States other than the Member State in which they have been approved, provided that the key audit partner leading the audit is approved as an auditor in the Member State concerned. However, once approval is obtained in the home Member State, the host Member State may require some form of registration of audit firms from other Member States. Passport for statutory auditors and \"softening\" the conditions for a statutory auditor to be approved in a different Member State : the proposed modifications regarding the approval of statutory auditors from other Member States are aligned with the provisions of the Directive 2005/36 on the recognition of professional qualifications. \u00a7  The proposal would allow statutory auditors to provide cross-border statutory audit services on a temporary or occasional basis. The conditions set out in the Professional Qualifications Directive would apply, notably the obligation to communicate the intention to provide the services in question to the relevant competent authority. \u00a7  A Member State will be able to offer the statutory auditor who is approved in another Member State the choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test, if such auditor wants to set up a permanent establishment in that Member State. The test should be aimed at assessing the statutory auditor's knowledge of the laws and regulations of that Member State that are relevant for the carrying out of the statutory audit. \u00a7  During the adaptation period, which should be offered to the applicant as an alternative to the aptitude test, the statutory auditor would be allowed to conduct statutory audit in the Member State, other than the one in which he or she is approved, under the supervision of a local auditor. The length of the adaptation period is three years. Requirements to competent authorities to cooperate regarding educational requirements and aptitude test : in order to ensure more convergence of the educational qualifications of auditors at Union level, the competent national authorities in charge of the public oversight for statutory auditors must cooperate. Cooperation at Union level is also necessary to harmonise the requirements of the aptitude test. Auditing standards and audit reporting : the proposal requires Member States to ensure that statutory auditors and audit firms carry out audits in accordance with the international auditing standards. New rules regarding competent authorities : currently, the Directive requires Member States to organise a system of public oversight for statutory auditors and audit firms. The new amendment states that the competent authority responsible for public oversight will be a public authority that will be also responsible for approval, registration and quality assurance. The competent authority responsible for the public oversight may delegate some of its tasks to other authorities or bodies with regard to the approval and registration of the statutory auditors and audit firms. Such delegation must be subject to several conditions and the body that bears the ultimate responsibility is the competent authority. Prohibition of contractual clauses: the proposal prohibits clauses according to which a third party suggests, recommends or requires the audited entity to appoint a specific statutory auditor or audit firm. Special rules for the statutory audit of small and medium-sized undertakings : following the recent Commission proposal, small undertakings would no longer be required by EU law to have their financial statements audited, although Member States may still require it. However, the requirement will continue to apply to medium-sized undertakings. When medium-sized undertakings are audited pursuant to EU law, the amended Directive requires Member States to ensure that the way in which the auditing standards are applied are adapted to the dimension and scale of those undertakings. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the European Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6523EP7, ECR%:0.684, EPP%:0.802, EFD/IDG%:0.29, Greens/EFA%:0.018, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.771, S&D%:0.005, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: information society services and especially intermediary services have become an important part of the EU\u2019s economy and daily life of Union citizens. Twenty years after the adoption of the existing legal framework applicable to such services laid down in e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, new and innovative business models and services, such as online social networks and marketplaces, have allowed business users and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. A majority of EU citizens now use those services on a daily basis. However, the digital transformation and increased use of those services has also resulted in new risks and challenges, both for individual users and for society as a whole. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more specifically, intermediary services). It aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the EU, by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member States have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. The proposed regulation lays down harmonised rules on the provision of intermediary services in the internal market. In particular, it establishes: - a framework for the conditional exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services; - rules on specific due diligence obligations tailored to certain specific categories of providers of intermediary services; - rules on the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, including as regards the cooperation of and coordination between the competent authorities. This proposal should apply to intermediary services provided to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or residence in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment of the providers of those services. Specific provisions The proposal lays down: - measures to counter illegal goods, services or content online, such as a mechanism for users to flag such content and for platforms to cooperate with \u2018trusted flaggers\u2019; - new obligations on traceability of business users in online marketplaces, to help identify sellers of illegal goods; - effective safeguards for users, including the possibility to challenge platforms\u2019 content moderation decisions; - transparency measures for online platforms on a variety of issues, including on the algorithms used for recommendations; - obligations for very large platforms to prevent the misuse of their systems by taking risk-based action and by independent audits of their risk management systems; - access for researchers to key data of the largest platforms, in order to understand how online risks evolve; - oversight structures to address the complexity of the online space: EU countries will have the primary role, supported by a new European Board for Digital Services; for very large platforms, enhanced supervision and enforcement by the Commission.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Opening of tariff quotas : the Union negotiated tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The proposal aims therefore to open annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. Management : the Commission: should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adoption of amendments to this Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision concluding an agreement with one or more third countries; should adopt, by means of implementing acts, rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this Regulation and, as appropriate, provisions: (a) guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; (b) relating to the recognition of the document allowing the guarantees referred to in point (a) to be verified; and (c) on the issue of import licences and their period of validity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 441EP8, ECR%:0.871, EPP%:0.946, EFD/IDG%:0.438, Greens/EFA%:0.98, NI%:0.173, REG%:0.955, S&D%:0.942, The Left%:0.788, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: the scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008, carried out in 2011, stated that the cod plan has not achieved its objectives and that they are unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Furthermore, the report revealed that there are flaws in the design of the Regulation and problems with its implementation. The Commission is proposing an amendment to the Regulation in the light of this advice and of the opinions received from Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and the Member States. The proposal for the amendment of the Regulation does not cover all the problems identified since this amendment is intended as an interim solution pending the development and implementation of a mixed-fishery plan for North Sea fisheries as anticipated in the reform. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal was drawn up on the basis of consultations with the Member States and stakeholders. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENTS: the main legal action is as far as possible to improve and clarify the provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 that were identified in the evaluation as problematic, in particular: \u00b7  the changes to Article 4 (Calculation of fishing effort) aim at closing the unintended possibility for Member States to deploy higher levels of effort than the plan was meant to allow simply by changing the methods used for the calculation of effort when establishing the baselines and when calculating usage; \u00b7  Article 9 (Special procedure for setting TACs) defines a procedure for TAC setting in the absence of the necessary information to apply Article 7 or 8. Instead of automatic reductions of 25% it is proposed to take a case-by-case, and therefore a more flexible, approach though remaining firmly based on available scientific advice; \u00b7  instead of exempting groups of vessels specified by each Member State, exemptions are now based on criteria that would be generally applicable for any vessels that meet them, regardless of the Member State to which they belong. The amended Article also avoids the need for constant adjustments of the baseline by Council; \u00b7  transitional measures will ensure that vessels groups already excluded will be subject to the criteria in force at the time of exclusion; \u00b7  vessels involved in the fully documented fishery trials , where all catches are counted against quota, are exempted from fishing effort regime; \u00b7  a new proposal foresees the possibility for the Council to decide not to apply further fishing effort reductions, once the fishing-effort ceiling has been reduced for four consecutive years; \u00b7  it is now made clear that the condition that cod catch are less than 5 % of the total refers to the catch composition over the management period, not per trip; \u00b7  in Article 14, the Member State obligation to address the discard issue is strengthened since it is not the case under the current ruling, and level of control and monitoring is specified according to risk-based management; \u00b7  the Committee procedure is brought into line with the rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 4200EP7, ECR%:0.86, EPP%:0.89, EFD/IDG%:0.581, Greens/EFA%:0.07, NI%:0.606, REG%:0.831, S&D%:0.867, The Left%:0.571, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the present proposal takes into account recent legislative and political developments regarding the Financial Regulation (FR). For the sake of legal clarity and in order to facilitate the negotiations of the European Parliament and the Council, it merges and replaces two earlier Commission proposals on the revision of the FR in a single text and under a standard legislative format (no recast). These two earlier proposals concerned on the one hand, the triennial revision of the Financial Regulation and, on the other hand, the revision of the FR to align it with the Lisbon Treaty , including the obligations of Member States concerning internal control and audit and their resulting responsibilities in shared management. Therefore, these two earlier proposals are withdrawn. Additionally, the proposal also incorporates the changes to the FR due to the adoption of the Regulation No 1081/2010 regarding the creation of the European External Action Service ('EEAS'). LEGAL BASE AND PROCEDURE: since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the FR is to be revised in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure in Article 322 TFEU. In order to allow the legislative authority to have a global view of the proposed modifications, the Implementing Rules of the Financial Regulation (IR) are presented, in a Commission Staff working document, together with the FR in a single package. The IR, which contains more detailed provisions complementing the FR, will be adopted under the delegated powers of the Commission according to Article 290 TFEU. The present proposal does not contain any change of substance compared to the two earlier proposals , which are: (i) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Union; (ii) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. As a consequence, the working document of the Commission services concerning the Implementing Rules to the FR, which has been put forward by the Commission together with the triennial revision, remains entirely valid. CONTENT: in 2011 more than EUR 126 billion is planned for allocation to EU policies benefiting the Union and its citizens. In the current economic context it is even more important that the delivery mechanisms of the budget operate in the most efficient way and facilitate the implementation of EU policies, while securing sound treatment of European taxpayers' money. In particular, it is important that these mechanisms are: (i) simple and transparent (especially to final recipients of EU funds); (ii) provide the possibility for leverage of non-EU budget resources and at the same time (iii) strengthen the Commission's accountability for implementation of the budget. (1) Need for a reform : reform is necessary with a view to adapting the financial rules to the new requirements of budget implementation (co-financing with other donors, specific financial instruments, PPPs) or where the basic principles create disproportionate workload (interests on pre-financing) or may unduly impede efficiency (prohibition of budget implementation through private sector bodies). The award of small grants and contracts also needs to be facilitated. Furthermore, the new procedure applicable to the IR, as set out in the Lisbon Treaty, should lead to a new articulation between the FR and the IR, imposing a complete review of the whole set of financial rules. In this context, the Commission has based its proposal on the following objectives: \u00b7 to introduce more flexibility in the application of budgetary principles, which should better suit operational needs and alleviate unnecessary administrative burden for recipients of Union funds; \u00b7 to streamline relations with implementing partners to which the Commission entrusts the management of programmes or part of programming actions (projects), in particular taking account of the nature of the implementing partner (Member States, agencies, EIB, public and private operators, etc.) and the financial risks entailed (proportionality); \u00b7 to shift the regime of grants from a real-cost based management (inputs) towards a performance-based scheme (outputs), in order to better target policy objectives and achieve significant simplification of procedural and documentary requirements for the benefit of beneficiaries, and facilitate the use of lump sums; \u00b7 to ensure sound financial management while leaving significant room for manoeuvre for Authorising Officers so that they can adapt the means to their operational constraints and the financial risks they are faced with; \u00b7 to modernise the system of risk management and control measures so as to make them more proportional to the probability of errors and to the cost involved. (2) Alignment with the Lisbon Treaty : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union \u2013 (TFEU), which entered into force on December 1, 2009, makes important changes concerning budgetary and financial issues. These changes should be translated in the Financial Regulation and concern in particular: \u00b7 the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the Treaty, and its link to annual budgetary procedure: in this regard, as a consequence of the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the TFEU, some provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management should be introduced in the Financial Regulation; \u00b7 the new annual budgetary procedure and the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, which have an impact on the provisions relating to transfers and the provisional twelfths; \u00b7 the new provisions introduced in Article 317 TFEU concerning the control and audit obligations of the Member States in the implementation of the budget, together with Point 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. The proposal also allows for the streamlining of the Financial Regulation in line with the Lisbon Treaty, through both technical adaptations and the deletion of obsolete provisions. TIMETABLE: the present revision of the FR occurs while preparation for the post-2013 programmes is also under way. It is important that all the actors concerned in the legislative process maintain an ambitious timetable for the present revision. They should aim at an agreement on the package (Financial Regulation and Implementing Rules) so that it could enter into application on 1 January 2012."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3254EP7, ECR%:0.596, EPP%:0.813, EFD/IDG%:0.194, Greens/EFA%:0.754, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.723, S&D%:0.779, The Left%:0.029, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the international maritime safety conventions require flag States to ensure that the equipment carried on board ships complies with certain safety requirements as regards design, construction and performance, and to issue the relevant certificates. To that end, detailed performance and testing standards for certain types of marine equipment have been developed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and by the international and European standardisation bodies. The international instruments leave a significant margin of discretion to the flag administrations . Back in 1995, the Commission clearly identified the problems encountered in the Internal Market as a result of this state of affairs and in the absence of EU harmonisation in the marine equipment sector. Council Directive 96/98/EC on marine equipment (MED) thus laid down common rules to eliminate differences in the implementation of international standards by means of a clearly identified set of requirements and uniform certification procedures. Experience has shown that it is necessary to take additional measures in order to enhance the implementation and enforcement mechanisms of the said Directive and simplify the regulatory environment while guaranteeing that IMO requirements are applied and implemented in a harmonised way across the Union. Decision No 768/2008 (New Legislative Framework) constitutes a general framework of a horizontal nature for future legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products and a reference text for existing legislation. This general framework provides appropriate solutions to the problems identified in the implementation of Directive 96/98/EC. It is therefore necessary to incorporate the definitions and reference provisions of Decision No 768/2008 into this Directive by making the adaptations which are required by the specific features of the marine equipment sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on two alternatives to the baseline (statu quo) scenario, namely: (i) a maximum alignment with the new legislative framework; and (ii) conditional alignment, allowing for a number of MED-specific measures in order to cater for the sector's particular features. The analysis showed that conditional alignment was the most effective and least burdensome solution and, at the same time, it had the most positive overall economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish requirements for marine equipment to meet the safety standards laid down in the applicable international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, in order to ensure that equipment which complies with these requirements can circulate unimpeded within the Internal Market and be placed on board ships flying the flag of any Member State . Scope : the scope of the Directive is defined by reference to equipment which is (a) due to be installed on board a ship flying the flag of a Member State , and (b) for which the approval of the flag State is required by the international conventions. Requirements for marine equipment : these are defined by reference to the international conventions and instruments. As required by these, demonstration of compliance is confined to the specific applicable testing standards. Given the need to ensure continued consistency with the international regulatory framework, these requirements and standards must apply in their up-to-date version. Responsibility : the proposal provides that the flag State has the responsibility to ensure that only equipment which has been duly approved in accordance with the then applicable requirements of the international instruments is placed on board ships flying its flag. In addition, the proposed Directive: provides the basis for the free movement of marine equipment within the EU, based on the concept of mutual recognition between Member States of equipment complying with the requirements laid down in the Directive; reflects the priority given to the international regulation of maritime safety, consistent with the global nature of shipping; governs the particular case of the transfer of a ship to a Member State's register based on the principle of compliance with the Directive\u2019s requirements; established rules and conditions for affixing the wheel mark; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards the specific obligations of the economic operators; lists the conformity-checking procedures made available to manufacturers; aligns the Directive with Decision 768/2008 as regards the EU declaration of conformity; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards notification, notifying authorities, notified bodies and their respective regimes; fully aligns the Directive with the general EU market surveillance framework, including as regards the safeguard procedure. Checks on board may be necessary and are therefore regulated; contains the specific regime in exceptional circumstances, largely taken from the existing Directive. This regime concerns exemptions in cases of technical innovation or for the purpose of testing and evaluation. Lastly, as regards the implementation measures, the Commission: shall be empowered to uniformly implement the requirement for marine equipment to comply with the specific design, construction and performance requirements laid down in the international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, as defined by the Legislator; is also empowered to adopt common criteria and procedures for the application of these requirements and standards; is charged with the task of gathering and publishing a significant package of information. This codifies and expands existing practice and will facilitate the implementation of the Directive by all actors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The tasks devolved to the Commission, including those for which the assistance of the European Maritime Safety Agency is foreseen, are not expected to represent an increase in workload and will be carried out with existing resources. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6781EP7, ECR%:0.895, EPP%:0.821, EFD/IDG%:0.419, Greens/EFA%:0.93, NI%:0.303, REG%:0.783, S&D%:0.79, The Left%:0.8, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Tunisian economy has been negatively affected by the domestic unrest that followed the 2011 revolution, regional instability (notably the war in Libya). In particular, the fiscal and balance of payments situation has deteriorated quite markedly, generating important financing needs. At the same time, following the ousting of President Ben Ali on 14 January 2011, the country is taking significant steps towards the establishment of democratic mechanisms. However, the political transition has not been without difficulties and episodes of instability. Against this background, the Tunisian authorities reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion (400% of quota), which was approved by the IMF Board in June. The aim of the SBA is to support the government\u2019s economic reform programme, reduce economic vulnerabilities and foster sustainable and inclusive growth. In this context, the Tunisian government requested Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million on 28 August 2013, with a portion in the form of a grant. The European Commission submits to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal to grant a MFA to the Republic of Tunisia amounting to a maximum of EUR 250 million. The assistance would take the form of medium-term loans, with no grant component being envisaged given that Tunisia does not meet the eligibility criteria for the use of grants in MFA operations. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make available to Tunisia MFA for a total maximum amount of EUR 250 million in order to: contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2014-15; support the fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of the IMF programme; facilitate and encourage efforts of the authorities of Tunisia to implement measures identified under the EU-Tunisia ENP Action Plan, and; support structural reform efforts aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management, strengthening economic governance and transparency, and improving conditions for sustainable growth. The full amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Tunisia in the form of loans. The loans shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. The Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions and to on-lend them to Tunisia. Disbursement of assistance : the assistance is planned to be disbursed in three loan instalments: - the disbursement of the first instalment (EUR 90 million) is expected to take place in mid-2014; - the second instalment (EUR 80 million), conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed towards the end of 2014; - the third and last instalment (EUR 80 million) could be made available, provided the policy measures are met, during the first half of 2015. Implementing conditions : respects effective democratic mechanisms : a pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that Tunisia respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. Both fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission; release of the Union's macro-financial assistance : this shall be managed by the Commission in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Tunisia; implementing reforms : the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment). The proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Decreased assistance : where the financing needs of Tunisia decrease fundamentally during the period of the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance compared to the initial projections, the Commission, acting in accordance with the examination procedure, shall reduce the amount of the assistance or suspend or cancel it. Where the circumstances permit, and if Tunisia so requests, the Commission may take the steps necessary to ensure that an early repayment clause is included in the loan terms and conditions and that it is matched by a corresponding clause in the terms and conditions of the borrowing operations. Implementing conditions : in order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the Tunisian authorities under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used for operations above that threshold as well as to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the assistance. Reports : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation. Not later than two years after the expiry of the availability period, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council an ex post evaluation report, assessing the results and efficiency of the completed Union's macro-financial assistance and the extent to which it has contributed to the aims of the assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (\"the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund\"). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2014 for a total amount of EUR 170 million and the third loan disbursement in 2015 for the amount of EUR 80 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2016-17 budgets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6895EP7, ECR%:0.702, EPP%:0.736, EFD/IDG%:0.226, Greens/EFA%:0.825, NI%:0.121, REG%:0.639, S&D%:0.697, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/9/EC relating to cableway installations designed to carry persons became applicable on 3 May 2002. It sets out essential requirements with which cableway installations, their infrastructure, subsystems and safety components must comply in order to be safe. The main types of cableway installations covered by Directive 2000/9/EC are funiculars, gondolas, detachable chair lifts, fixed-grip chair lifts, aerial tramways, funitels, combined installations (made of several cableway types, such as those of gondolas and chairlifts) and drag lifts. Experience from the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC showed the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty mainly as regards the: (i) scope, in particular with regard to new types of cableway installations; (ii) lack of an appropriate range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems, which has led to divergent interpretations and implementation of the conformity assessment of subsystems. It is also necessary to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the \u201cgoods package\u201d adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008 establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an \u201calignment package\u201d adopted on 21 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred solution consists of combining two options: (i) amending Directive 2000/9/EC; (ii) providing more extensive guidance on the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC with regard to its scope and of recommending the application of specific conformity assessment procedures for the assessment of subsystems. CONTENT: the proposal intends to replace Directive 2000/9/EC on cableway installations designed to carry persons by a Regulation. It lays down rules on the design and construction of cableway installations designed to transport persons and on the making available on the market and the free movement of subsystems and safety components for such installations. The proposal intends to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the \u201cgoods package\u201d adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008. Scope : the proposal clarifies and updates the existing scope: in light of the development of new types of cableway installations, it is clarified that the exclusion of cableway installations used for leisure purposes in fairgrounds or amusement parks does not apply to cableway installations that are intended for a dual function, namely of transporting persons and for leisure activities; the exclusion of certain cableway installations intended for agricultural or industrial purposes is maintained, but it clarifies that it also covers cableway installations intended for the service of mountain shelters or huts that are not intended for the transport of the public; the current exclusion of cable-operated ferries is also updated to all cable-operated installations where the users or carriers are water-borne, such as cable-operated water ski installations; the exclusions provided for in Directive 2000/9/EC relating to rack-and-pinion railways and chain-driven installations are not reintroduced. Obligations of economic operators : the proposal contains, with regard to subsystems and safety components, the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision. Harmonised standards : Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2000/9/EC which cover the same aspects have not been reintroduced in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. Conformity assessment : the proposal keeps the requirement for a notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all subsystems and safety components. It introduces a range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems based on the conformity assessment modules of the NLF Decision. In this framework, it also introduces the CE marking for subsystems. Notified bodies : in line with the NLF Decision, the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and introduces specific requirements for notifying authorities.

However, the designation of notified bodies pursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the rule of law is one of the essential values upon which the Union is founded. As recalled by Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, these values are common to the Member States. Respect for these values must therefore be ensured throughout all Union policies. This includes the EU budget, where respect for fundamental values is an essential precondition for sound financial management and effective EU funding. The Commission considers that the European Union should be given the possibility to adopt the rules necessary for the protection of the Union\u2019s budget in the case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The proposal is based on the 2014 Commission Communication \"A new EU framework to strengthen the rule of law\", the February 2018 Commission Communication \"A new and modern multiannual financial framework for a European Union that implements its priorities efficiently beyond 2020\" and the standards and principles developed by the Council of Europe. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation establishes the rules necessary for the protection of the Union\u2019s budget in the case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. Measures : appropriate measures shall be taken where a generalised deficiency as regards the rule of law in a Member State affects or risks affecting the principles of sound financial management or the protection of the financial interests of the Union such as: (i) the proper functioning of the authorities of that Member State implementing the EU budget, in particular in the context of public procurement procedures; (ii) the proper functioning of investigative services in the context of the fight against fraud and corruption; (iii) effective judicial control by independent courts of acts or omissions of the abovementioned authorities; (iv) jeopardised the independence of the judiciary. Content of measures : the proposal lists the type of measures that could be taken and specifies that Member States receiving EU funds should receive them. This concerns in particular the suspension of payments or the implementation of the legal commitment or a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments where the Commission implements the Union budget directly or indirectly. Procedure : measures should be on the basis on a Council decision following a proposal from the Commission. The decision shall be deemed to have been adopted by the Council, unless it decides, by qualified majority, to reject the Commission proposal within one month of its adoption by the Commission. The European Parliament should also be fully involved at all stages. Proportionality : measures need to be adopted in full respect of the principles of transparency and proportionality. It is also important to ensure that the consequences of measures have a sufficient connection with the aim of the funding. This also points to the need to ensure that the consequences fall on those responsible for identified shortcomings. It should therefore reflect the fact the individual beneficiaries of EU funding, such as Erasmus students, researchers or civil society organisations, cannot be considered responsible for such breaches."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 8961EP8, ECR%:0.043, EPP%:0.629, EFD/IDG%:0.0, Greens/EFA%:0.9, NI%:0.038, REG%:0.821, S&D%:0.738, The Left%:0.231, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers it necessary to make certain amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (Rural Development Regulation) to ensure policy continuity in the final years of the programming period and to ensure a smooth transition to the next programming period. In relation to direct payments, some of the provisions in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 (Direct Payment Regulation) do not cover calendar year 2020 since expenditure relating to calendar year 2020 is made in financial year 2021, which is the first year of the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. Those Member States would be faced with important changes in their direct payments and rural development envelopes with considerable effects on the payments to farmers under both pillars. CONTENT: this proposal aims to ensure the continuity of support to European farmers in the years 2019 and 2020 by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 and direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. As regards support for rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (EAFRD), the proposal relates to financial years 2019 \u2013 2021, whereas the proposed modifications for direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 relate to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. Rural development : the proposal makes it possible for the Member States to modify the degressivity schedule for payments to areas, which had received such payments in the previous programming period, while in the ongoing period, not being classified anymore as areas facing natural constraints other than mountain areas pursuant to the Rural Development Regulation. This modification would allow calculating transitional payments for the years 2019 and 2020 based on payment levels of the 2014-2020 period. The proposal extends the use of the technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to actions related to the preparation of the future CAP. The proposal concerns exclusively the scope of technical assistance without modifying the financial support. Flexibility between pillars in year 2020 and transfer of the product of reduction of direct payments to Rural development : flexibility between pillars is an optional transfer of funds between direct payments and rural development. The proposal includes provisions regarding the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between pillars in calendar year 2020 (corresponding to financial year 2021). It calls for a transfer between pillars to remain possible in calendar year 2020 under the same conditions as currently standing and that the estimated product of reduction continues to be transferred from direct payments to rural development. In order to promptly provide the necessary flexibility to the Member States and to ensure the continuity of the rural development policy in the final years of the 20142020 programming period, this Regulation should apply from 1 March 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any financial implications in terms of increased expenditure. The effect of the proposed provisions giving Member States an option to transfer amounts between direct payments allocations in calendar year 2020/financial year 2021 and EAFRD in financial year 2021 as well as the transfer of the estimated product of reduction from direct payments in calendar year 2020 to EAFRD in financial year 2021 will depend on Member States\u2019 implementation and can therefore not be quantified at present. Such transfers will in any case remain neutral with regard to overall commitment appropriations in the way that any deductions from the direct payments allocations will be off-set by a corresponding increase in the EAFRD allocations and vice versa."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 9005EP8, ECR%:0.857, EPP%:0.851, EFD/IDG%:0.833, Greens/EFA%:0.96, NI%:0.154, REG%:0.94, S&D%:0.859, The Left%:0.654, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: during 2015, the European Union witnessed extraordinary pressures at its external borders with an estimated 1.5 million persons having crossed the borders illegally between January and November. The significant secondary movements have led several Member States to reintroduce border control at their internal borders. This has put considerable strain on the functioning and coherence of the Schengen area. Throughout the current migration crisis, it became clear that the Schengen area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected. A chain is always only as strong as its weakest link. A decisive step towards an integrated management system for external borders therefore is needed. This is only possible as a shared task among all Member States, in line with the principles of solidarity and responsibility to which all the EU\u2019s institutions have agreed as the guiding principles addressing the migration crisis The objective of this draft Regulation is to provide for a more integrated management of the EU\u2019s external borders, inter alia by providing the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences to prevent that deficiencies of external border management or unpredicted migratory flows undermine the proper functioning of the Schengen area. It responds to the calls of the European Parliament and the European Council to effectively manage the external borders of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposed Regulation is part of a package of measures presented by the Commission in order to better ensure the protection of the EU\u2019s external borders. It establishes a European Border and Coast Guard and a European Border and Coast Guard Agency built from Frontex. It seeks to provide the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences in the fields of external border management and return than Frontex currently has. This proposal sets outs out the following elements reinforcing the role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as compared to that of Frontex: a monitoring and supervisory role and liaison officers : a monitoring and risk analysis centre will be established to monitor migratory flows towards and within the European Union and to carry out risk analysis and mandatory vulnerability assessments to identify and address weak spots. Liaison officers of the Agency to be deployed to Member States so that the Agency can ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through risk analysis, information exchange and Eurosur, but also through its presence on the ground. The task of the liaison officer is to foster cooperation between the Agency and the Member States and in particular, to support the collection of information required by the Agency for carrying out the vulnerability assessment and to monitor the measures taken by Member States at the external borders; evaluation of needs : supervisory role for the Agency by establishing a mandatory vulnerability assessment by the Agency to assess the capacity of Member States to face challenges at their external borders, including by means of an assessment of the equipment and resources of Member States as well as of their contingency planning. The Executive Director, on the advice of a Supervisory Board created within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will identify the measures that need to be taken by the Member State concerned and should set a time-limit within which those measures need to be taken. The decision of the Executive Director will be binding on the Member State concerned, and where the necessary measures are not taken within the set time-limit, the matter will be referred to the Management Board for a further decision. If the Member State would still fail to act, thereby risking putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, the Commission may adopt an implementing decision for direct intervention by the Agency; urgent joint action : enhanced tasks for the Agency consisting of the setting up and deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams for joint operations and rapid border interventions, the setting up of a technical equipment pool, assisting the Commission in coordinating the activities of the migration management support teams at hotspot areas, and a strengthened role in return, risk analysis, training and research; a rapid reserve pool of border guards: mandatory pooling of human resources by establishing a rapid reserve pool which will be a standing corps composed of a small percentage of the total number of border guards in the Member States on a yearly basis. The deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams from the rapid reserve pool should be immediately complemented by additional European Border and Coast Guard Teams as appropriate. The rapid reserve pool shall be a standing corps placed at the immediate disposal of the Agency and which can be deployed from each Member State within three working days from when the operational plan is agreed upon by the Executive Director and the host Member State. For that purpose, each Member State shall, on a yearly basis, make available to the Agency a number of border guards commensurate to at least 3% of the staff of Member States without land or sea external borders and 2% of the staff of Member States with land or sea external borders, and which shall amount to a minimum of 1 500 border guards, corresponding to the profiles identified by the decision of the Management Board; return office : there will be a stronger role for the Agency on return by establishing a Return Office within the Agency to allow for the deployment of European Return Intervention Teams composed of escorts, monitors and return specialists who will work to effectively return illegally staying third country nationals. A standard European travel document for return will ensure a wider acceptance of returnees by third countries. The Agency will coordinate and organise return operations and return interventions from one or more Member States, and promote their organisation on its own initiative to reinforce the return system of the Member States which are subject to particular pressure; research : further participation by the Agency in the management of research and innovation activities, including the use of advanced surveillance technology such as remotely piloted aircraft systems; deployment of an own technical equipment pool by acquiring itself or in co-ownership with a Member State and managing a pool of technical equipment provided by the Member States, based on the needs identified by the Agency and by requiring that the technical equipment pool be completed by means of transport and operating equipment purchased by Member States under the Specific Actions of the Internal Security Fund; coast guard functions : European cooperation on coast guard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coast guard functions; increased cooperation with third countries by coordinating operational cooperation between Member States and third countries in border management, including the coordination of joint operations, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents; strengthen the mandate of the Agency to process personal data by also allowing for the processing of personal data in the organisation and coordination of joint operations, pilot projects, rapid border interventions, return operations, return interventions and in the framework of the migration management support teams, as well as in the exchange of information with Member States, the European Asylum Support Office, Europol, Eurojust or other Union Agencies; guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights by setting up a complaint mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, to be built from the existing Frontex, is tasked with the management of the external borders alongside the Member States. The subsidy for Frontex, which is to be renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency, already forms part of the Union\u2019s budget. The Agency\u2019s budgets for 2015 and 2016 have been reinforced in 2015 in order to enable it to address the migratory crisis, in particular by tripling the financial resources for joint operations Poseidon and Triton, extending the Agency\u2019s support to the Member States in the area of returns and giving to necessary resources to implement hotspots. The final EU subsidy for 2016 as adopted by the Budgetary Authority is EUR 238 686 000. However, for the Agency to adequately address its new tasks as foreseen in this proposal, in 2017 an amount of at least EUR 31.5 million will need to be added to the Agency\u2019s Union budget in addition to that one for 2016."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3662EP8, ECR%:0.543, EPP%:0.923, EFD/IDG%:0.021, Greens/EFA%:0.02, NI%:0.077, REG%:0.91, S&D%:0.911, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 provides that the Union budget should continue to support fisheries and maritime affairs policies. Europe's maritime sector employs over 5 million jobs generating almost EUR 500 billion a year, with a potential to create many more jobs. The output of the global ocean economy is estimated at EUR 1.3 trillion and this could more than double by 2030. Fisheries are vital to the livelihood and cultural heritage of many coastal communities in the EU and an essential part of their cultural heritage. Along with aquaculture, it also contributes to food security and nutrition. EU support is a key tool for sustainable fisheries and the conservation of the sea's biological resources, for food security through the supply of seafood, for the growth of a sustainable blue economy and for healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans, notably in the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) for the period 2021-2027. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall be repealed. The new Fund shall support the environmental, economic, social and employment objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), promote the implementation of the Union's maritime policy and support the Union's international commitments in the field of ocean governance. The fund's support shall be based on four priorities: 1. Fostering sustainable fisheries and the conservation of marine biological resources : support from the EMFF shall aim to achieve and maintain sustainable fishing based on the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and to minimise the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem with particular attention to small-scale fishermen. That support shall include innovation and investments in low-impact, climate resilient and low-carbon fishing practices and techniques. Support for fleet adaptation remains sometimes necessary with regard to certain fleet segments and sea basins. Such support should be tightly targeted to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and aimed to achieve balance between the fishing capacity and the available fishing opportunities. 2. Contributing to food security in the Union through competitive and sustainable aquaculture and markets : the EMFF may support the promotion and the sustainable development of aquaculture, including freshwater aquaculture, for the farming of aquatic animals and plants for the production of food and other raw material. Public health actions, aquaculture stock insurance schemes and animal health and welfare actions shall also be eligible. 3. Enabling the growth of a sustainable blue economy and fostering prosperous coastal communities : the fund shall support community-led local development under shared management to stimulate economic diversification in a local context through the development of coastal and inland fisheries, aquaculture and a sustainable blue economy. It shall also support the collection, management and use of data to improve knowledge of the state of the marine environment. 4. Strengthening international ocean governance and enabling safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans : the EU plays a leading role in particular in preventing, deterring and eradicating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, improving the international framework for ocean governance, reducing pressures on oceans and seas, creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy and strengthening international ocean research and data. The EMFF shall support these international commitments and objectives under direct management. The EMFF shall also contribute to achieving the Union's environmental objectives in the light of the Commission's proposal to increase the total share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25%. Simplification : under the proposal, the EMFF beyond 2020 shall evolve towards a simplified architecture. Its effectiveness shall be improved by (i) allowing Member States to target support based on their strategic priorities; (ii) better targeting of support for the CFP; and (iii) better alignment with other EU funds since the rules applicable to all structural and investment funds are laid down in a Common Provisions Regulation. In concrete terms, the EMFF shall co-finance projects alongside national funding streams with each Member State receiving a share of the total budget. Member States would prepare their national operational programmes indicating how they intend to spend the funds. Once these programmes have been approved by the Commission, the national authorities would decide which projects they wish to finance. Proposed budget : the proposed overall budget for the EMFF amounts, in current prices, to EUR 6.14 billion, of which (i) EUR 5.31 billion allocated to support under shared management by the Member States through EMFF programmes based on national strategies and (ii) EUR 829 million to direct management. Concerning shared management, after having deducted the value of the UK programme (EUR 243 million), Member States would retain, in nominal terms, 96.5% of their 2014-2020 allocation. In order to ensure stability in particular with regard to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, the definition of national allocations will be based on the 2014-2020 shares."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 9486EP9, ECR%:0.065, EPP%:0.038, EFD/IDG%:0.151, Greens/EFA%:0.878, NI%:0.228, REG%:0.019, S&D%:0.052, The Left%:0.805, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 defines the framework for the public governance and financing of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. In particular, it allocates EUR 3405 million for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. As provided for in the Regulation, the Commission adopted a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the mid-term review of the European satellite navigation programmes on 18 January 2011. As a result of this report, the Council, among other things, expressed its support once again for the European satellite navigation programmes as defined in Regulation (EC) No 683/2008. It also noted the overall cost estimates and the fact that the Commission would submit a proposal including changes to the governance model with a view to the next multiannual financial framework. For its part, in its resolution adopted on 8 June 2011, the Parliament also restated its support for the European satellite navigation programmes and considered that it should be principally funded by the Union budget. It asked the Commission to submit legislative proposals quickly with particular emphasis on the need to provide a long-term, stable framework, in particular for operation of the systems. In its Communication dated 29 June 2011, accompanied by a proposal for a Council Regulation of the same date, the Commission proposed to assign EUR 7 000 million to the financing of the European satellite navigation programmes during the next multiannual financial framework for the 2014-2020 period. Nevertheless, it indicated here that it is necessary to maintain efforts to control costs and that new management procedures should be planned for the long-term. It should be noted that this sum of EUR 7 000 million, at 2011 constant prices, is an absolute ceiling and corresponds to a sum of EUR 7 897 million at current prices. The Commission recalls that it should be borne in mind that the Galileo and EGNOS programmes are flagship projects of the Union and fit in perfectly with the Europe 2020 strategy and policies for sustainable development. It should also be emphasised that the European satellite navigation programmes does not only concern the Member States with the greatest involvement in the space field: they concern all the Member States of the Union directly. As part of Europe 2020's f lagship initiative 'An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era' the Commission is responsible for developing an effective space policy to provide the tools to address some of the key global challenges and in particular to deliver Galileo. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on the continued implementation of the programmes and on two particular key problems: i) firstly, the configuration of future services, given that the budget allocated for the period 2008-2013 is insufficient to complete the infrastructure of the system established under the Galileo programme and to ensure the operation of EGNOS; and ii) the definition of the operational governance model and the financing required. concerning the system established under the Galileo programme, evaluation of the various options has shown that the best option is to retain the services initially specified, with the exception of the (Safety of Life) SoL service. This solution, which requires less infrastructure on the ground, reduces the costs; with regard to EGNOS, the system is already operational and many users are enjoying its benefits. In addition, when the SoL service was declared operational, the Commission gave assurances regarding the continuity of this service to users who went on to make significant investments. Ending the EGNOS programme is not an option in this context. On the second point , the impact assessment concluded that the Commission, representing the Union, should remain responsible for the programmes while the Union continues to ensure their funding alone, as proposed by the Commission. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The proposed Regulation meets the requests of the Parliament and the Council while taking into account the contents of the Commission Communication of 29 June 2011. It is the basic act for European satellite navigation programmes for the period covered by the next multiannual financial framework, providing in particular for funding and the governance model for the programmes. Given the magnitude of the changes to be made to Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, it was deemed necessary to propose that it be replaced with a new Regulation rather than amended. The Commission proposes to earmark EUR 7 000 million (EUR 7 897 million in current prices) to guarantee the completion of the EU satellite navigation infrastructure and to ensure the exploitation of the systems until 2020, such as the operations of the space and terrestrial infrastructures, the necessary replenishment/replacement activities, certification procedures, and notably the provision of services. The proposal also recalls that the Union remains the owner of the systems. Therefore the management of the programmes' exploitation should be delegated to the European GNSS Agency while management of the programmes' deployment should be delegated to the European Space Agency. In order to enable the European Parliament and the Council to gain a full picture of the conditions under which the European GNSS Agency would be obliged to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under the new governance model, particularly concerning resources, the Commission will submit a proposal in 2012 for the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 and of the associated financial statement. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Union will continue to finance the Galileo and EGNOS programmes alone. Its contribution to the programmes for the period 2014-2020 shall not exceed EUR 7 897 million at current prices. It covers three main activities, namely, completion of the deployment phase of the Galileo programme, the exploitation phase of the same programme and operation of the EGNOS system. The latter includes ongoing improvement of the services provided by the system in order to meet the changing needs of users. Retaining the expertise acquired within the Commission is an essential factor in ensuring the continuity of the programmes. Consequently, the Commission will retain temporary agents currently in employment for periods to be determined in accordance with the various phases of the programmes and will transfer personnel to the European GNSS Agency.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: connected technologies account for 50% of productivity gains in recent years across all sectors. The Commission considers that they are the key for Europe to emerge stronger from the crisis, if impediments to growth arising from ongoing fragmentation are addressed. After over a decade of Union legislative interventions to liberalise and integrate the telecommunications market, Europe is fragmented into 28 separate national communications markets, each with a limited number of players. This patchy scenario raises barriers to entry and increases the costs for operators wanting to provide cross-border services thereby impeding their expansion. EU rules on, for example, authorisations, regulatory conditions, spectrum assignment and consumer protection are implemented in diverging ways. As a consequence, while no operator is present in more than half of the Member States, most in far fewer, overall more than 200 operators serve a market of 510 million of customers. This stands in stark contrast with the US or China who have one single market of 330 and 1400 million customers respectively, served by four to five large operators, with one legislation, one licensing system, and one spectrum policy. The untapped potential of an EU single market in electronic communications is estimated at up to 0.9% GDP, or EUR 110 billion per year. The benefits from a single market for business communication services alone amount to almost EUR 90 billion per year. In the wider economy, increasing ICT investment, improving e-skills in the labour force and reforming the conditions for the Internet economy could boost GDP by an additional 5% up to 2020, and create 3.8 million jobs. The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), one of the flagship initiatives of Europe 2020 Strategy, has already recognised the role of ICT and network connectivity as an indispensable basis for the development of our economy and society. The 2013 Spring European Council stressed the importance of the digital single market for growth and called for concrete measures, in order to establish a single market in information and communications technology (ICT) as early as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in order to tackle these sources of fragmentation, three policy options were selected for further analysis: option 1 was based on the regulatory framework for electronic communications as it stands; option 2 considered a single legislative instrument (a Regulation) adjusting the regulatory framework only where necessary for a single EU market for electronic communications, based on enhanced EU coordination; option 3 included the substance of the second option, but replaced the current governance structure by a single EU regulator in order to achieve full regulatory coordination. The impact assessment report concludes that the second option is the best available. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the general objective of the proposal is to move towards a single market for electronic communications in which: citizens and businesses can access electronic communications services wherever they are provided in the Union, without cross-border restrictions or unjustified additional costs; companies providing electronic communications networks and services can operate and provide them wherever they are established or their customers are situated in the EU. The proposal builds upon and advances the main directives of 2002 governing the provision of electronic communications, as amended in 2009, by introducing directly applicable legislative provisions which shall operate in conjunction with the provisions of the directives on subjects such as authorisation, spectrum assignment and access to networks. The main elements of this proposal are as follows: A single EU authorisation mechanism : operators wanting to provide services in several Member States must currently be authorised in each of them. The proposed Regulation introduces a single EU authorisation based on a single notification system in the Member State of main establishment of the European electronic communication provider (the home country) and sets out the conditions applicable to it. European inputs : mobile providers in Europe today lack the necessary predictability regarding spectrum availability across the EU and must deal with diverging assignment conditions. It is thus more difficult to plan long-term, to invest across borders and eventually to gain scale. Such a patchy situation means that device manufacturers design their products for other markets with greater scale and growth prospects. To put an end to this unsustainable situation, harmonisation of spectrum inputs must be ensured by: guaranteeing mobile operators predictable assignment conditions and coordinated timeframes to access spectrum for wireless broadband across the EU; harmonising ways to access European fixed networks so that providers can more easily offer their services across the single market. The proposal also ensures harmonised, high-quality virtual access to fixed networks would facilitate market entry and the provision of cross-border services both to end-users and businesses, and would help drive competition and investment. Rights of end-users : t o guarantee an appropriate level of consumer protection across the EU, rules defining the rights of end-users are harmonised, including: non-discrimination between certain domestic and intra-EU (international) communications (unless differences are objectively justified); mandatory pre-contractual and contractual information; increased transparency and facilities to avoid \"bill shocks\"; the right to terminate the contract after six months without costs (excluding the residual value of any subsidised equipment or other promotions); the obligation on providers to provide unhindered connection to all content, applications or services being accessed by end-users \u2013 also referred to as Net Neutrality - while regulating the use of traffic management measures by operators in respect of general internet access. At the same time, the legal framework for specialised services with enhanced quality is clarified. Facilitating change of provider : the proposal provides for harmonised principles applicable to switching procedures are provided, such as cost-orientation, receiving provider-led process, automatic termination of contract with the transferring provider. This proposal, together with the Commission Recommendation on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing methodologies to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment environment, forms a set of balanced measures aimed at moving towards a Single Market in Telecommunications and fostering investment.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: high-speed broadband infrastructure is the backbone of the Digital Single Market and a precondition for worldwide competitiveness, for example, in the field of e-Commerce. According to the 2010 report on the Single Market, telecommunications services and infrastructures in the EU are still highly fragmented along national borders. A recent report on the cost of non-Europe in the electronic communications sector has shown that the untapped potential of the Single Market corresponds to a yearly amount of 0.9% GDP, or EUR 110 billion. As recalled in the Communication on the Single Market Act II, a 10% increase in broadband penetration can result in a 1-1.5 % increase in the GDP annually and 1.5% labour productivity gains. Broadband-induced innovation in companies creates employment and has the potential to generate 2 million extra jobs by 2020. The Union has subscribed to ambitious broadband targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe: by 2013, basic broadband for all Europeans, and by 2020, (i) access to speeds of above 30 Mbps for all Europeans, and (ii) subscription of internet connection above 100 Mbps for 50% or more of European households. These goals will only be achieved if the infrastructure deployment costs are lowered across the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed four options: \u00b7  Option 1 (Status quo) : maintaining the current approach of monitoring, enforcement and guidance. \u00b7  Option 2 : recommending measures towards a more coherent and harmonised application by National Regulatory Authorities of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. \u00b7  Option 3 : a proposal for a Regulation aiming at unlocking the potential of cross-sector cooperation (two sub-options, 3a and 3b, discuss options regarding respectively, a regulation only and a combination of a regulation and a recommendation). \u00b7  Option 4 : a proposal for legislation complementing the current regulatory framework to mandate measures going beyond option 3, (such as infrastructure atlases, cost-oriented infrastructure access, mandated cooperation in civil engineering works even when not financed by public means, and installation of high-speed-ready infrastructure even in old buildings). The impact assessment concludes that option 3a is the best option available, given its effectiveness in achieving the objectives identified, the costs-benefits analysis, and ability to exploit the cost reduction potential efficiently and coherently with general EU policy objectives. A study estimates that if measures were taken to address the problems identified, the potential capital savings to operators are in the range of 20\u201330% of total investment costs, i.e. up to EUR 63 billion by 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the objectives of the proposed Regulation are to reduce the cost and enhance the efficiency of deploying high-speed electronic communications infrastructure by scaling up existing best practices across the EU. In order to do this, the proposal sets out a number of directly applicable rights and obligations across the various steps of infrastructure deployment, which can lead to significant cost reductions. The proposal aims to lower the barriers to investment and market entry (i) by allowing for more intensive usage of existing physical infrastructures, (ii) by enhancing cooperation on planned civil works, (iii) by streamlining procedures on granting permits and (iv) by removing obstacles to high-speed-ready in-building infrastructure. This initiative therefore addresses four main problem areas: \u00b7  inefficiencies or bottlenecks concerning the use of existing physical infrastructure (such as ducts, conduits, manholes, cabinets, poles, masts, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions); \u00b7  bottlenecks related to co-deployment; \u00b7  inefficiencies regarding the granting of administrative permits; \u00b7  bottlenecks concerning in-building deployment. In order to maximise synergies across networks, the regulation is aimed not only at electronic communications network providers but to any owner of physical infrastructures, such as electricity, gas, water and sewage, heating and transport services, which are suitable for hosting electronic communications network elements.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that, under certain conditions, field inspections carried out in the third countries listed in its Annex I on certain seed-producing crops are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that, under certain conditions, seed of certain cereal species produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law. Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022. On 29 January 2016, Bolivia submitted a request to the Commission to consider seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia as offering the same assurances as regards identity, health and quality as seed produced in the EU on the basis of official controls carried out by the competent authorities of that country. Following this request, the Commission assessed the relevant Bolivian legislation and carried out an audit of the Bolivian seed production and certification system. The Commission identified shortcomings and made recommendations to Bolivia. As Bolivia addressed these shortcomings by 30 November 2018, the Commission recognised that the Bolivian system in place offered the same assurance as the EU system. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to grant equivalence in respect of field inspections of seed producing crops of sorghum, maize and sunflower carried out in Bolivia and in respect of seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia and officially certified by its authorities. As Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022, it is proposed to extend by 7 years (until 31 December 2029) the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision, in order to avoid any risk of disruption of seed imports into the Union. The proposal will stimulate seed trade between Bolivia and the EU. Granting the EU equivalence would therefore contribute to the maintenance of the continuous supply of high quality seed in the EU.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU provides a budgetary guarantee to the EIB covering risks of a sovereign and political nature in connection with its loan and loan guarantee operations carried out outside the EU in support of EU external policy objectives. The overall scope and general conditions of the EU guarantee coverage for EIB external operations have been set out in previous Council decisions, the EIB external mandates. Most recently, the EIB external mandate for the period 2007-2011 was established by Decision No 633/2009/EC of 13 July 2009, which requires the Commission to present a mid-term report on its application accompanied by a proposal for its amendment, drawing on an external evaluation. On the basis of findings of the mid-term review, this proposal aims to ensure the continuation of the EU guarantee for EIB external financing for the remainder of the current financial perspectives 2007-2013, whilst introducing a number of new elements in the mandate. The introduction of these new elements necessitated a number of modifications to the current mandate Decision. For the sake of clarity, it was therefore chosen to replace the mandate Decision with a new decision rather than presenting a proposal for amendments. LEGAL BASES: Articles 209 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the EU. CONTENT : the proposed decision will cover EIB financing operations signed during the period beginning on 1 February 2007 and ending on 31 December 2013.The new elements to be introduced in the new decision are the following: activation of the EUR 2 billion \"optional mandate\", which was placed in reserve by the Decision. This optional mandate will be activated not as an increase of individual regional ceilings, but as a mandate dedicated to projects which contribute to the fight against climate change across all regions covered by the decision; replacing the current system of regional objectives for operations under EU guarantee with horizontal high-level objectives covering all regions under the external mandate. These high-level objectives will be included in the Articles of the proposed decision and will cover the areas of climate change, social and economic infrastructure and local private sector development; development by the Commission, together with the EIB, and in consultation with the European External Action Service (EEAS), of operational guidelines for each region under the external mandate, reflecting EU regional strategies in order to strengthen the link between the implementation of EIB activities in line with the general high-level objectives under the external mandate and EU regional priorities; strengthening of the capacity of the EIB to support EU development objectives through (i) enhancing the EIB's appraisal and monitoring of social and development aspects of projects; (ii)increasing the focus of EIB intervention in sectors which will further the development of third countries, such as environmental infrastructure including water and sanitation, sustainable transportation and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The EIB should also progressively increase its activity in support of health and education; activation of the EIB external mandate for Iceland, Belarus, Libya, Iraq and, Cambodia. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Guarantee Fund for external actions set up by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, provisioned by yearly transfers from the general EU budget, provides a buffer for the EU budget against shocks due to losses on EIB external financing operations. The forecasts take into account the impact of the EUR 2 billion \"optional mandate\" on the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund. On the basis of the 9% provisioning rate, the financial impact of the allocation of the EUR 2 billion on the provisioning of the Fund will amount to a maximum of EUR 180 million over the period 2012-2020, on the assumption that the corresponding loans are fully disbursed.

BACKGROUND : on 19 January 2009 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Member Countries of the Andean Community, which resulted in a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. The Agreement was initialled on 23 March 2011.

This is the purpose of the proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT : the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism of the EU- Colombia and Peru Free Trade Agreement. 1) Principles on the imposition of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with this Regulation where a product originating in Columbia or Peru is, as a result of tariff concessions on that product under the Agreement, being imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: a suspension of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Tariff Elimination Schedule of the European Union set out in Annex I to the Agreement; an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the most-favoured-nation (\"MFN\") applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the base rate as specified in the Tariff Elimination Schedule of the European Union set out in Annex I to the Agreement. Initiation of proceedings : an investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to above, to justify such initiation. The request to initiate an investigation shall generally contain the following information: the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment. An investigation may also be initiated in the event that there is a surge of imports concentrated in one or several Member States, provided that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the conditions for initiation are met. The proposal makes provision for the procedures for initiating an investigation and the conditions under which the latter may be done. Investigation : following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation, which shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of its initiation. That time limit may be extended by a further period of three months in exceptional circumstances such as the involvement of an unusually high number of parties, or complex market situations. Prior surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in Colombia or Peru is such that it could lead to a serious threat to the Union market, imports of that product may be subject to prior surveillance measures. Such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in the text. Prior surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in Colombia or Peru have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty. Provisional measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure, including on imperative grounds of urgency. Provisional measures shall be shall not apply for more than 200 days. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that conditions regarding a serious threat to Union industry are met the Commission shall invite the authorities of Colombia or Peru to hold consultations in accordance with the Agreement. Where no satisfactory solution has been reached within 45 days, the Commission may adopt a decision imposing definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure. The text also contains provisions on the termination of investigation and proceeding without measure. Duration and review of safeguard measures : it is provided that a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, and may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the Union industry is adjusting.. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. Confidentiality and transparency : the text contains provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information received pursuant to the Regulation. Information shall in any case be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information. At the same time, when initiating an investigation, provisions are made to ensure transparency, and interested parties and representatives of Colombia and Peru may inspect all information made available to the Commission, which shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable. There ate other provisions to ensure transparency, such as such as the Commission\u2019s obligation to ensure password-protected online access to the non-confidential file through which all information which is not confidential shall be disseminated. The European Parliament shall be granted access to this online platform. 2) Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas: for bananas originating in Colobia and Peru (fresh Bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category \"BA\" in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I to the Agreement, a stabilisation mechanism shall apply until 1 January 2020. A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports of products as indicated in the Annex to the Regulation. Once the trigger volume for either Colombia or Peru is met during the corresponding calendar year, the Commission may, in accordance with the examination procedure, temporarily suspend the preferential customs duty applied to products of the corresponding origin during that same year for a period of time not exceeding three months, and not going beyond the end of the calendar year. In case the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, the Commission shall apply the lesser of: (i) the base rate of customs duty or (ii) the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken. In case the Commission applies these actions, it shall immediately enter into consultations with the affected country y (either Colombia or Peru or both) to analyse and evaluate the situation on the basis of factual available data. These measures may be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. If no agreement on the future relationship that covers aviation safety is reached by the end of the transition period, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union will affect in particular the validity of certificates and licenses issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency on behalf of the United Kingdom, or by certain design organisations based in the United Kingdom. Regarding certain aeronautical products (\u2018type certificates\u2019) and companies (\u2018organisation approvals\u2019), the United Kingdom resumes, for its jurisdiction as of the end of the transition period, the role of \u2018State of design\u2019 under the Convention on International Civil Aviation. It is therefore necessary to develop a controlled transition mechanism, ensuring that the affected products or designs, which were certified by the Agency or a design organisation certified by the Agency before the end of the transition period, can continue to be used in Union aircraft without disruption. CONTENT: the proposal concerns aviation safety and complements Union Regulation (EC) 2018/1139 to deal specifically with the situation entailed by the end of transition period set in the withdrawal agreement in the absence of an agreement covering aviation safety matters applicable by that date. The proposal should allow EU manufacturers to continue production and operators to continue to operate these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. An interruption of these activities would cause serious economic and social difficulties. By ensuring compliance with EU law by the bodies concerned, the proposal should also ensure the protection of consumers and citizens. This Regulation should apply to the certificates listed in the Annex which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by the Agency to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom or by a design organisation having its principal place of business in the United Kingdom.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in view of the end of the transitional period provided for in the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom has submitted to the Commission a request for recognition of equivalence, from 1 January 2021, of fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of fibre and oil plants produced in the United Kingdom with fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of oil plants produced in the Union. The United Kingdom has also requested the recognition of the equivalence as regards the checks on practices for the maintenance of varieties carried out in the United Kingdom pursuant to those Directives. The Commission has carried out a review of the relevant legislation in the United Kingdom. It has concluded (i) that the requirements and the system in force are equivalent to those of the Union and offer the same guarantees as the Union system; (ii) that the checks on practices for the maintenance of such varieties carried out in the United Kingdom afford the same assurances as those carried out by the Member States. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the equivalence of field inspections, and of checks on practices for the maintenance of seed-producing crops of cereal species and the equivalence of the seed produced have been recognised. This recognition is based on an examination of the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and system in place offer the same guarantees as the Union's system.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 19 January 2009, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a trade agreement on behalf of the Union with those Member Countries of the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) which shared the aim to reach a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement. On 26 June 2012, the EU signed a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. The Trade Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 March 2013 for Peru and 1 August 2013 for Colombia. On 17 July 2014, the Union and Ecuador concluded their negotiations on the Protocol to take account of the Accession of Ecuador to the Trade Agreement. The text of the Protocol was approved by the Trade Committee of the Trade Agreement at its meeting of 8 February 2016. CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Protocol of Accession to the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Colombia and Peru on the other part, to take account of the Accession of Ecuador. The Protocol in question establishes the necessary modifications to the Trade Agreement to take account of the accession of Ecuador. The Trade Agreement establishes the conditions for EU economic operators to take full advantage of the opportunities and the emerging complementarities between our respective economies: According to the Commission, the accession of Ecuador to the existing Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru, which is a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement, reinforces the legal framework of the EU trade relations with this country and facilitates reciprocal trade and investment.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/35/EC was adopted to combat late payment in commercial transactions between businesses or between businesses and public authorities. It specifies, inter alia, that statutory interest may be charged when payment is not made within the contractual or legal deadline. There is overwhelming evidence that, despite the entry into force of Directive 2000/35/EC late payment in commercial transactions is still a general problem within the EU. In addition, there is also evidence in a number of Member States of unjustifiably long contractual payment periods in transactions involving public administrations. Given the importance of public procurement in the EU (more than 1 943 billion euro per year), late payment by public authorities has a strong negative impact on enterprises. Many public authorities do not face the same financing constraints as businesses and late payment in their case is avoidable. It should therefore be more severely sanctioned when it occurs. Moreover, diverging payment attitudes across the EU might hamper business participation in public tenders, which distorts competition and undermines the functioning of the internal market. It is therefore essential to modify Directive 2000/35/EC. While safeguarding the main elements of the Directive, it is essential to introduce additional tools to reduce the number of late payments in commercial transactions, to shorten payment periods for public administrations and to substantially reinforce the incentives for public administrations to pay in time by recasting the Directive, incorporating in a single text both the substantive amendments made to the Directive and its unchanged provisions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers the following options: Option 1: baseline option- comprises a number of recently adopted measures that will quicken the payment process and introduce new means of pursuing judicial and extra-judicial claims for the recovery of outstanding payments for commercial transactions in cross-border cases within the EU. Option 2a (non-legislative): the organisation of awareness raising activities targeted at businesses. Option 2b (non-legislative): the organisation of awareness raising activities targeted at organisations representing SMEs. Option 2c (non-legislative): Publication of information on bad debtors. Option 3a (legislative): Harmonisation of payment periods. Option 3a/1: The harmonisation of payment periods between economic operators. Option 3a/2: the harmonisation of the periods for payment by national authorities to conomic operators. Option 3b (legislative): increasing the \u201cmargin\u201d interest rate. Option 3c (legislative): the abolition of the threshold. Option 3d (legislative): the introduction of a \u201cLate Payment Fee\u201d. Option 3e (legislative): the introduction of a \u201cLate Payment Compensation\u201d. Option 3f (legislative): Extending the role of representing organisations. Only options 3a/2, 3c, 3d and 3e meet the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and consistency. Therefore, these 4 options constitute the basis of this proposal. CONTENT: this proposal is part of the Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Jobs and implements the Small Business Act which highlighted the importance of SMEs for the competitiveness of the EU economy and the Commission Communication on an European Economic Recovery Plan which called in particular for public authorities to pay invoices for supplies and services within one month. This recast of Directive 2000/35/EC aims at improving the effectiveness and the efficiency of remedies for late payment through the introduction of an entitlement to the recovery of administrative costs and compensation for internal costs incurred due to late payment. More specifically, the proposal lays down the following: the provisions of Directive 2000/35/EC on its scope (Article 1 of this proposal), interest in case of late payment (Article 3), the retention of title (Article 8) and the recovery procedure for unchallenged claims (Article 9) remain fundamentally unchanged. The various definitions and concepts are streamlined and brought together in Article 2. The reasons for the other proposed substantive amendments are the following: Article 1(2) removes the possibility that claims for interest of less than \u20ac5 may be excluded by Member States. This will clear a hurdle for claiming interest for late payments, in particular for SMEs and for late payment in smaller transactions where interest amounts to only a small sum. Article 4 specifies that, in the case of late payment, creditors will be entitled to obtain a sum for internal recovery costs related to the amount paid late. The objective is twofold: firstly, the creditor would be able to recover his internal administrative costs related to late payment and, secondly, this would have a deterrent effect on debtors, additional to the statutory interest. Article 5 of the proposal tackles late payment by public authorities which will be obliged as a general rule to pay invoices for commercial transactions leading to the delivery of goods or the provision of services within 30 days. Past this period, the creditor will in principle be entitled to compensation of 5% of the amount specified, in addition to the interest for late payment and the compensation for recovery costs. The budgetary impact for national authorities will be proportional to their capacity to ensure compliance with the provisions of the directive. In addition, the expected improvement in payment behaviour of public authorities will help reduce the number of business bankruptcies and thus reduce the social costs that they entail. Article 6 of the proposal strengthens the provisions about grossly unfair contractual clauses. It includes a provision whereby a clause which excludes interest for late payment will always be considered as grossly unfair. Article 7 obliges Member States to ensure full transparency about the rights and obligations stemming from this directive and in particular to publish the statutory interest rate. This aims at providing in the most appropriate way practical information to businesses, and especially SMEs, and will enable them to take action against debtors paying late. Article 10 lays down the monitoring and evaluation system allowing other European institutions and stakeholders an insight into the actual implementation of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications are limited to administrative expenditure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 1066EP7, ECR%:0.702, EPP%:0.857, EFD/IDG%:0.645, Greens/EFA%:0.86, NI%:0.364, REG%:0.94, S&D%:0.815, The Left%:0.571, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: public procurement plays a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. The award of works concessions is presently subject to basic rules of Directive 2004/18/EC on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts while the award of services concessions with a cross-border interest is subject to the principles of the Treaty, and in particular the principle of free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services as well as to the principles deriving therefrom such as equal treatment, non-discrimination, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency. There is a risk of legal uncertainty related to different interpretations of the principles of the Treaty by national legislators and of wide disparities among the legislations of different Member States. Such risk has been confirmed by the extensive case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union but which has only partially addressed certain aspects of the award of concession contracts. The absence of clear rules at Union level governing the award of concession contracts gives rise to legal uncertainty and to obstacles to the free provision of services and causes distortions in the functioning of the Internal Market. As a result, economic operators, in particular Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are being deprived of their rights within the Internal Market and miss out on important business opportunities, An adequate legal framework for the award of concessions would ensure effective and non-discriminatory access to the market to all Union economic operators and legal certainty, favouring public investments in infrastructures and strategic services to the citizen. Hence, a uniform concretisation of the Treaty principles across all Member States and the elimination of discrepancies in their understanding following therefrom is necessary at the Union level in order to eliminate persisting distortions of the Internal Market. The Commission announced the intention to adopt a legislative initiative on concessions in its communication \u201cThe Single Market Act Twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence\u201d of 13 April 2011. This draft is being put forward in tandem with the revision of Public Procurement Directives (COD/2011/0438 and COD/2011/0439). It will result in the adoption of a separate legal instrument regulating the award of concessions which, together with the two proposals to revise Public Procurement Directives (2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC), aims at creating a modern public procurement legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the final impact assessment report confirmed the need for new legislation. It found that economic operators are faced with an unlevel playing field, which often leads to missed business opportunities. The optimal solution identified was legislation based on the current provisions on public works concessions, adequately adjusted and supplemented with certain specific provisions. A more restrictive approach, would be to extend to concessions the provisions that apply to public contracts. This approach was considered counter-productive in that it could potentially discourage contracting authorities from using concessions. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53 (1), Article 62 and Article 114 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposed Directive is expected to guarantee transparency, fairness and legal certainty in the award of concession contracts, and thereby contribute to improved investment opportunities and ultimately to more and better quality of works and services. It will apply to concessions awarded after its entry into force. This provision is in line with rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union on modifying contracts. (1) Legal certainty : the main objective of the Directive is to provide for clarity on the legal framework applicable to the award of concessions, but another is to clearly delimit the scope of application of this framework. Definition : the present proposal for a Directive on the award of concession contracts provides for a more precise definition of concession contracts with reference to the notion of operational risk. It makes clear what types of risk are to be considered operational and how to define significant risk. It also provides references as to the maximum duration of concessions. Incorporation of Treaty obligations into secondary law : the proposal extends the majority of the obligations which currently apply to the award of public works concessions to all services concessions. . It also lays down a number of concrete and more precise requirements, applicable at different stages of the award process on the basis of the Treaty principles, as interpreted in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Moreover, it extends the application of secondary law to the award of concession contracts in the utilities sector, which is currently exempt from such legislation. Public-public cooperation : there is considerable legal uncertainty as to how far cooperation between public authorities should be covered by public procurement rules. The relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union is interpreted differently between Member States and even between contracting authorities. Hence the present proposal clarifies the cases in which contracts concluded between contracting authorities are not subject to the application of concession award rules. Such clarification is guided by the principles set out in the relevant case law of the Court of Justice. Modifications : a specific provision on modifying concessions incorporates the basic solutions developed in the case law and provides a pragmatic solution for dealing with unforeseen circumstances requiring an a concession to be modified during its term. (2) Better access to the concessions markets: the proposal provides for a fundamental improvement economic operators' access to the concessions markets. The provisions are primarily designed to increase the transparency and fairness of award procedures by restricting the arbitrariness of contracting authorities and contracting entities' decisions on such issues as prior and post-publication, procedural safeguard, selection and award criteria and the deadlines imposed on tenderers. Furthermore, they provide for a better access to justice in order to prevent or to address violations of those provisions. Publication in the Official Journal : in order to ensure transparency and equal treatment to all economic operators, the present proposal provides for compulsory publication of concession contracts with a value equal to or greater than EUR 5 000 000. Deadlines : this proposal also sets a minimum deadline for the submission of interest in any concession award procedure, amounting to 52 days, as this is currently the case for public works concessions. It has been decided to provide for concessions a longer deadline than in case of public contracts, given that concession contracts are usually more complex. Selection and exclusion criteria : the rules are less restrictive than similar provisions currently applicable to public contracts. However, they restrict the selection criteria to those related to the economic, financial and technical capacity of the bidder and limit the scope of the acceptable exclusion criteria. Award criteria : the proposal provides for an obligation to apply objective criteria linked to the subject matter of the concession, ensuring compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment, guaranteeing that tenders are assessed in conditions of effective competition allowing an overall economic advantage for the contracting authority or the contracting entity to be determined. These criteria should prevent arbitrary decisions by contracting authorities and contracting entities and must be published in advance and listed in descending order of importance. Member States or contracting authorities or contracting entities which so wish, may also provide for or apply the \u2018most economically advantageous tender\u2019 criterion for the award of concessions. Procedural guarantees : unlike the Public Procurement Directives, the proposed rules do not contain a fixed catalogue of award procedures. This solution allows contracting authorities and contracting entities to follow more flexible procedures when awarding concessions notably reflecting national legal traditions and permitting the award process to be organised in the most efficient way. However, the proposal establishes a number of clear procedural safeguards to be applied to the award of concessions notably during negotiations. These safeguards aim at ensuring that the process is fair and transparent. Remedies : this proposal provides for an extension of the scope of application of the Remedies Directives (Directives 89/665/EEC and 92/13/EC, as amended by Directive 2007/66/EC) to all concession contracts above the threshold in order to guarantee effective channels for challenging the award decision in court and provide minimal judicial standards which have to be observed by contracting authorities or entities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5527EP7, ECR%:0.86, EPP%:0.828, EFD/IDG%:0.355, Greens/EFA%:0.895, NI%:0.242, REG%:0.94, S&D%:0.897, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the European Union concluded the deal with Latin American countries (Geneva Convention) and the US in December 2009 which settles 15 years of banana disputes. It also cuts the tariff which the EU applies to bananas imported from Latin American countries. With those two agreements, years of lengthy and complex negotiations where put to an end. With the Geneva Agreement entering into force, it is necessary to abolish the existing applied EU Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate for the importation of bananas by repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas which established the currently applied rate of EUR 176/tonne. In accordance with the Geneva Agreement, the Union will gradually reduce its banana tariff from EUR 176/tonne to EUR 114/tonne. A first cut, which was applied retroactively as of 15 December 2009, the date of initialling of the Agreement, reduced the tariff to EUR 148/tonne. The subsequent cuts are to apply in seven annual instalments with a possible delay of a maximum of two years if agreement on agriculture modalities in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is delayed. The final tariff of EUR 114/tonne is to be reached on 1 January 2019 at the latest. The tariff reductions will be bound in the WTO at the moment of the certification of the EU banana schedule. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Agreements reduce progressively the tariff rates for bananas. It can be estimated that these measures will lead to smaller own resources as follows: -EUR 3.5 million in 2009, -EUR 74.8million in 2010, - EUR 88.1 million in 2011, and -EUR 106.8 million in 2012. These are net amounts after deduction of collecting costs by Member States.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the School Milk Scheme and the School Fruit Scheme have developed independently and in different time periods: the School Milk Scheme has been implemented since 1977, and the School Fruit Scheme came out of a political commitment in the context of the 2007 reform of the Common Market Organisation for fruit and vegetables. The current schemes operate within different legal and financial frameworks, and have some important differences in their design and functioning. The Commission proposes changes to the programmes in order to make them more efficient, and better respond to the overarching problems of declining fruit and vegetable and milk consumption and rising obesity. Furthermore, the Commission made a commitment in the context of the adoption of Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 to review the financing arrangements of the current schemes, namely aid for the distribution of milk as well as the co-financing of the school fruit scheme costs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three options considered, the option chosen is the \"new framework\" scenario that entails a considerable policy change in the form of a common legal and financing framework for the distribution of a restricted number of products, complemented by an orientation towards the long-term objectives through a strengthened educational dimension of the scheme. CONTENT: it is proposed to establish a common legal and financial framework for the distribution of fruit and vegetables and milk to children in schools, supported by strengthened educational measures to reaffirm the link with agriculture, as well as wider issues such as public health and environmental matters. The proposal sets out the key elements of the new scheme. 1) Distribution : it is proposed to focus the distribution of products in schools to two \"core products\": fresh fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and drinking milk only, with the fat content of drinking milk to be decided upon by national health authorities. The distribution will take place within a fixed budget, and will help reverse the declining consumption trends for these two groups of products. 2) Unify the financial provisions and improve financing conditions : in view of the differences between the products and their supply chains, as well as different consumption situation across the Member States, separate \"envelopes\" would be allocated to Member States for fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and milk. The envelope for fruit and vegetables is EUR 150 million and the envelope for milk is EUR 80 million. Certain flexibility is provided for, where Member States can transfer limited shares of their allocations between the envelopes based on their needs. Accordingly, without exceeding the global ceiling of EUR 230 million Member States may transfer up to 15% of their indicative allocations for fruit and vegetables including bananas or for milk to the other sector under conditions to be specified by the Commission by means of delegated acts Within the envelopes, thresholds are established for supporting measures and other eligible measures, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication. Based on experience gained so far, the level of EU contribution towards the price of products is limited through a maximum EU aid per portion for fruit and vegetables and for milk, and not through the EU co-financing levels, as was the case for the School Fruit Scheme. This would be a new element for fruit and vegetables, which would help alleviate the huge disparities in price for products distributed and would imply a simplification in terms of a management. The level of EU subsidy for milk is increased. Member States will be allowed to continue providing national top-ups or attract private funding in order to enlarge the scope and/or the intensity of their intervention of the school schemes. The aid will be allocated to each Member State taking into account certain criteria including (i) the number of six- to ten-year old children as a proportion of the population, (ii) the degree of development of the regions within a Member State so to ensure higher aid to less developed regions and (iii) for milk, the historical use of funds. Reinforce the educational dimension : supporting educational measures will also become a requirement for milk distribution, thus bridging the gap between the current schemes. These measures will have a focus on agricultural issues, nutrition/health (balanced diets) and environmental matters and aim to connect children with food, agricultural production and farmers. Member States could choose thematic educational measures that could occasionally include agricultural products, other than the two core products, such as yoghurts, processed fruit and vegetables, honey, or olive oil. The list of all products supplied under the scheme and their nutritional aspects have to be approved by national health authorities. Supporting educational measures would have to be directly linked to the agricultural objectives of the scheme and be in line with the objective of promoting healthy diets. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact of the proposal is budgetary neutral compared to the current situation. For fruit and vegetables , the budgetary ceiling currently set in Regulation No 1308/2013 (EUR 150 million per school year) is maintained in this proposal. For milk , the proposal includes an envelope of EUR 80 million per school year, corresponding to the expected budget execution and in line with the overall amounts for market-related expenditure and direct aids taken into account in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. As regards distribution of expenditure, the greatest support will be given to the distribution and supporting educational measures. Other costs, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication, will also be eligible to a more limited extent.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp fall in air traffic due to a significant drop in demand and the adoption by Member States and third countries of direct measures, such as border closures and flight bans, to curb its spread. Figures published by the EU Network Manager at the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (\u2018Eurocontrol\u2019), indicate a fall in air traffic of around 90% for the European region at the end of March 2020 as compared to March 2019. The aviation sector is of strategic importance to the European Union and makes a vital contribution to the EU\u2019s overall economy and employment. In 2016, for example, the aviation sector supported 9.4 million jobs in the EU and contributed more than EUR 624 billion to the EU's GDP. It also contributes to the success of SMEs and tourism. The liquidity crisis in the aviation sector may lead to insolvencies within a few months if left unaddressed. Given the contribution of aviation to the overall performance of the EU economy and the importance of its overall weight, the Commission considers it essential that the EU takes action to support the EU aviation sector. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to temporarily amend several provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to allow the Commission and national authorities to more easily address a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate of the impacts on the aviation sector for the duration of the crisis. These temporary measures include the following: Modification to air carrier licencing rules in case of financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, Member States must suspend or revoke the operating licence of any air carrier, which may not to be able to fulfil its actual or potential financial obligations for the next twelve months. Alternatively, the authorities may grant a temporary licence to such airlines. However, experience has shown that it also sends a very negative signal to the market about the ability of an airline to survive, which in turn aggravates its financial problems, in particular in terms of cash flow. Accordingly, the proposal proposes that based on assessments, carried out from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, the competent licensing authority may decide before the end of that period not to suspend or revoke the operating license of the Union carrier provided that safety is not at risk, and that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction within the following 12 months. Simplification of procedures for the imposition of restrictions on traffic rights The proposal provides for a temporary derogation to procedural requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. The derogation clarifies that a Member State may temporarily keep a justified and proportionate emergency measure in place for a period beyond 14 days \u2013 but limited to the duration of public health risks clearly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should be able to refuse, limit or impose conditions on the exercise of traffic rights to deal with problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which could be of extended duration. Such emergency measures taken in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic should respect the principles of proportionality and transparency and should be based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. At the request of any of the Member State(s) involved or on its own initiative, the Commission may suspend this action if it does not meet the requirements of the Regulation or is otherwise contrary to Union law. To this effect, Member States are obliged to inform the Commission about changes in duration and scope of their emergency measures. Improving the efficiency of ground handling contracting during the COVID-19 crisis The proposal allows the managing bodies of airport to prolong contracts of suppliers of ground handling service until 31 December 2021, in derogation of Directive 96/67/EC. It also allows the managing body of an airport to directly choose a ground handling service for a maximum period of six months.

BACKGROUND: Decision 804/2004/EC established the Hercule I programme and Decision 878/2007/EC extended this programme over the period 2007 to 2013, as Hercule II. The latter placed specific emphasis on the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting to reflect the legal obligations of the Commission stemming from the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeiting Agreement with Philip Morris International signed in 2004. It was the first of the agreements signed with international cigarette manufacturers under which, in recognition of more than US$ 2 billion to be paid by them into national and the Union Budgets over periods of up to 20 years, the Commission and Member States agreed that European efforts to suppress the illegal traffic in tobacco products would be enhanced. The annual provision for Hercule was duly increased from 2007. As the legal basis for Hercule II will expire at the end of 2013, its replacement should ensure the continuity of European support for the activities carried out by the Commission and Member States in providing better information, carrying out studies and providing training or technical and scientific assistance in the fight against fraud. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the protection of the Union's financial interests against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union is a shared responsibility between the Commission and Member States. The Hercule III programme concerns this specific sphere of activity of the Commission and its cooperation with Member States\u2019 competent authorities, as well as with the other European institutions and bodies, particularly OLAF. It is essential that there should continue to be an instrument specifically dedicated to fighting fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an impact assessment. Four options, with their impact on the budget, were considered. Option 1 : to continue the programme with the same level of funding (baseline scenario); Option 2 : to renew the Hercule programme with improved objectives and a better methodology, including in particular a higher maximum rate of co-financing for technical support such as the procurement of equipment; Option 3 : to significantly alter the distribution between the different spending objectives and put much greater support on operational and law enforcement activities; Option 4 : discontinue the Hercule programme, with the possibility of continuing some actions under other Union co-financing programmes and/or to leave other actions to the Member States. In view of the past experience, the option to renew the programme with improved objectives and a better methodology is the preferred option (option 2) with a budgetary envelope in real prices which remains similar to the current envelope (approximately EUR 15 million per year). In contrast, Option 3 would result in an imbalance to the detriment of specific support for actions of prevention and detection of fraud and it might lead to confusion with regard to the attribution of responsibilities between Member States and the European Union. Member States are primarily responsible for the fight against fraud. Discontinuing the programme would reduce expenditure at Union level, without creating real economies and offsetting resources at national level or in the framework of another Union programme. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325 TFEU. CONTENT: this proposal establishes the Hercule III programme to promote activities against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. This objective shall be measured, inter alia, through the amount of recoveries following fraud cases detected by joint actions and cross border operations, the increased percentage of successful joint operations, and the increased number of cases accepted by the criminal investigative authorities. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Purpose: the aims are to: \u00b7 target exclusively the protection of the financial interests of the Union, in the context of a long term vision which is coherent with other Union objectives, on the basis of the priorities defined each year for this specific field of expertise; \u00b7 allow the implementation of other Union programmes to focus on priorities other than the protection of the financial interests; \u00b7 fully take into account the results of the actions already co-financed in the past in this field, including in terms of targeted beneficiaries and geographical balance; \u00b7 have direct impact on not only some Member States investigations, but also on OLAF investigations. Added value: the programme in particular creates savings deriving from the collective procurement of specialised equipment and databases to be used by the stakeholders and those derived from the collective specialised training. An increased effectiveness of the cross-border operations is expected on the basis of common technical standards and joint training. The Programme shall contribute to: \u00b7 developing the activities at Union level and the Member States to counter fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, including the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting; \u00b7 an increased transnational cooperation at the Union level and in particular to the effectiveness of the cross-border operations; \u00b7 an effective prevention of fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, by offering joint specialised training for staff of national, regional administrations and to other stakeholders. Bodies eligible for funding : these are (i) national or regional administrations of a Member State or a third country which promote the strengthening of action at Union level to protect the Union's financial interests; (ii) research and educational institutes and non-profit making entities provided that they have been established and have been operating for at least one year, in a Member State or in a third country. Eligible actions : the Programme shall provide financial support for the following actions: (a) Provision of specialised technical assistance for national authorities through: \u00b7 providing specific knowledge, specialised and technically advanced equipment and effective information technology (IT) tools facilitating transnational cooperation and cooperation with the Commission; \u00b7 ensuring the necessary support and facilitating investigations, in particular the setting up of joint investigation teams and cross border operations; \u00b7 supporting Member States' capacity to store and destroy seized cigarettes as well as independent analytical services for the analysis of seized cigarettes; \u00b7 enhancing staff exchanges for specific projects, in particular in the field of the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting; \u00b7 providing technical and operational support for the law enforcement authorities of the Member States in their fight against illegal cross border activities and fraud affecting the Union financial interests, including in particular support for customs authorities; \u00b7 building information technology capacity throughout the Member States and third countries by providing specific databases and IT tools facilitating data access and analysis; \u00b7 increasing data exchange, developing and providing IT tools for investigations, and monitoring intelligence work. (b) Organisation of specialised training, and risk analysis training workshops, as well as conferences, aimed at: \u00b7 further fostering better understanding of Union and national mechanisms; \u00b7 exchanging experience between the relevant authorities in Member States, and third countries as well as representatives of international organisations, including specialised law enforcement services; \u00b7 coordinating the activities of Member States, third countries, and international public organisations; \u00b7 disseminating knowledge, particularly on better identification of risk for investigative purposes; \u00b7 developing high-profile research activities, including studies; \u00b7 improving cooperation between practitioners and academics; \u00b7 further raising the awareness of the judiciary and other branches of the legal profession for the protection of the financial interests of the Union. (c) Any other action, provided by the annual work programmes, which is necessary for attaining the general and specific objectives provided for in the text. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the programme will cover the period 2014-2020, and the overall budgetary envelope is EUR 110 000 000 in current prices. This amount is in line with the Commission's Communication on the next Multi-Annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: ''A Budget for Europe 2020''."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5548EP7, ECR%:0.912, EPP%:0.846, EFD/IDG%:0.581, Greens/EFA%:0.877, NI%:0.485, REG%:0.928, S&D%:0.877, The Left%:0.829, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU (\u2018MiFID\u2019) together with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (\u2018MiFIR\u2019) was adopted in the wake of the financial crisis. MiFID and MiFIR, collectively referred to as MiFID II, covers securities markets, investment intermediaries and trading venues. The new framework reinforces and replaces the current MiFID framework (Directive 2004/39/EC). Member States need to transpose the Directive by 3 July 2016. Both MiFID and MiFIR are scheduled to apply as of 3 January 2017. During the legislative process, the very high level of complexity of the MiFID II package and the need for a significant number of implementing measures were recognised. To this end, a period of 30 months was foreseen between the adoption and the entry into application, instead of the usual 18-24 months. Despite this unusually long period, ESMA has made clear to the Commission that the technical implementing challenges are of such magnitude that essential data infrastructures will not be in place in time for 3 January 2017. This is a result of significant challenges in collecting the data that is necessary for the operation of the MiFID II rules. The absence of data has ramifications across multiple areas of MIFID II. As regards market regulation, it is clear that without the foundation of reference data (instrument ID) and the additional data infrastructures for transparency calculations and position reporting in place, it will not be possible to apply the majority of the market rules. In order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption, urgent action is therefore needed to adjust the date of entry into application for MiFID II Changing the date of applicability of MiFID II does however have consequences for the applicability of other legislation, in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014 ('MAR' \u2013 market abuse) and Regulation (EU) 909/2014 ('CSDR' - central securities depositories regulation). CONTENT: the purpose of the draft proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 on markets in financial instruments is to extend the entry into application of both instruments that are comprised in the MIFID II package as a result of the technical implementation challenges met by the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), national competent authorities ('NCAs') and stakeholders. In order to enable ESMA, NCAs and stakeholders to complete the operational implementation, the Commission considered it appropriate to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 by 12 months until 3 January 2018. Reports and reviews should be deferred accordingly. The Commission stated that an extension of one year should provide sufficient and reasonable time for ESMA, NCAs and operators to put in place the infrastructure for data collection, reporting and the transparency threshold calculations. In order to ensure that references in Regulation (EU) 596/2014 to organised trading facilities, small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 ('SME') growth markets, emission allowances or auctioned products based thereon do not apply until the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU, Article 39(4) of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 stating that references to them are read as references to Directive 2004/39/EC should be adjusted taking into account the extension of the date of application of those acts. In order to ensure that Directive 2004/39/EC is referenced in Regulation (EU) 909/2014 until the extended date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU and that the transitional provisions for MTFs applying for registration as SME growth markets under Regulation (EU) 909/2014 are maintained so as to provide sufficient time for MTFs to apply for such registration under Directive 2014/65/EU, it is proposed that Regulation (EU) 909/2014 should be amended."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3384EP8, ECR%:0.786, EPP%:0.896, EFD/IDG%:0.188, Greens/EFA%:0.0, NI%:0.154, REG%:0.955, S&D%:0.89, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

BACKGROUND : the Common Aviation Area Agreement between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part has been negotiated under a mandate received from the Council in June 2009. Air services between the EU and Georgia presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Georgia. It is part of the EU neighbourhood policy to replace this network of bilateral agreements through the establishment of a Common Aviation Area between the EU and its neighbours. The negotiating mandate set the objective of establishing a Common Aviation Area (CAA) between the EU and Georgia. This would extend the rules and provisions of the single market for air transport in the EU to a large extent to Georgia in which European and Georgian airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, a draft Agreement with Georgia was initialled by the two sides on 5 March 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Agreement ensures the gradual establishment of an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area. A report prepared for the Commission in 2008 by consultants, estimated that an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area would generate 25,000 extra passengers and consumer benefits of up to EUR 17 million in the first effective year of market opening. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee which will be responsible for reviewing the implementation of the Agreement and its effects. LEGAL BASE : CONTENT : The Agreement aims at: - gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; - non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators based on the principles of the EU Treaties; - Alignment of the Georgian aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement provides for the possibility for Georgia to join the main multilateral aviation agreement with European countries, the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) signed in 2006.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member States. It was complemented by several instruments providing specific data protection rules in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (ex-third pillar), including Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA has a limited scope of application , since it only applies to cross-border data processing and not to processing activities by the police and judiciary authorities at purely national level. The Framework Decision leaves a large room for manoeuvre to Member States' national laws in implementing its provisions. Additionally, it does not contain any mechanism or advisory group similar to the Article 29 Working Party supporting common interpretation of its provisions, nor foresees any implementing powers for the Commission to ensure a common approach in its implementation. Due to the specific nature of the field of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, it was acknowledged in Declaration 21 (annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon) that specific rules on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data in the fields of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation based on Article 16 TFEU may prove necessary. In 2010, the European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative initiatives. In its resolution on the Stockholm Programme , the European Parliament welcomed a comprehensive data protection scheme in the EU and among others called for the revision of the Framework Decision. The Commission stressed in its Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme the need to ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is consistently applied in the context of all EU policies. In its Communication on \u201c A comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union \u201d, the Commission concluded that the EU needs a more comprehensive and coherent policy on the fundamental right to personal data protection. This proposal further details the approach for the new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the EU as presented in its Communication on this issue. The legal framework consists of two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and this proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of: (i) improving the internal market dimension of data protection, (ii) making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and, (iii) creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence, including police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. As regards this latter objective in particular, two policy options were assessed: a first one basically extending the scope of data protection rules in this area and addressing the gaps and other issues raised by the Framework Decision, and a second more far-reaching one with very prescriptive and stringent rules, which would also entail the immediate amendment of all other \"former third pillar\" instruments. A third \"minimalistic\" option based largely on interpretative Communications and policy support measures, such as funding programmes and technical tools, with minimum legislative intervention, was not considered appropriate to address the issues identified in this area in relation to data protection. The analysis of the overall impact led to the development of the preferred policy option which is incorporated in the present proposal. According to the assessment, its implementation will lead to further strengthening data protection in this policy area in particular by including domestic data processing, thereby also enhancing legal certainty for competent authorities in the areas of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 16(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive repeals Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. It defines the rules relating to processing of personal data for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal offences, and sets out the Directive's two-fold objective, i.e. to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of public safety, and to ensure the exchange of personal data between competent authorities within the Union. It defines the scope of application of the Directive. The scope of the Directive is not limited to cross-border data processing but applies to all processing activities carried out by 'competent authorities' as defined in the Directive. Principles : the proposal sets out the principles relating to processing of personal data and requires the distinction, as far as possible; between personal data of different categories of data subjects. It sets out the grounds for lawful processing, when necessary for the performance of a task carried out by a competent authority based on national law, to comply with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person or to prevent an immediate and serious threat to public security. The proposed Directive sets out a general prohibition of processing special categories of personal data and the exceptions from this general rule. It establishes a prohibition of measures based solely on automated processing of personal data if not authorised by law providing appropriate safeguards. Rights of the data subject : the proposal introduces the obligation for Member States to ensure easily accessible and understandable information, and to oblige controllers to provide procedures and mechanisms for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights. This includes the requirement that the exercise of the rights shall be in principle free of charge. It specifies the obligation for Member States to ensure the information towards the data subject. It also provides the obligation for Member States to ensure the data subject's right of access to their personal data. The proposal provides that Member States may adopt legislative measures restricting the right of access if required by the specific nature of data processing in the areas of police and criminal justice, and on the information of the data subject on a restriction of access. Provisions on the rectification, erasure and restriction of processing in judicial proceedings provide clarification based on Article 4(4) of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Controller and processor : the proposal sets out that the Member States must ensure the compliance of the controller with the obligations arising from the principles of data protection by design and by default. It clarifies the position and obligation of processors, and adds new elements, including that a processor that processes data beyond the controller's instructions is to be considered a co-controller. It introduces the obligation for controllers and processors to maintain documentation of all processing systems and procedures under their responsibility. Data security : the Article on the security of processing is based on the current Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46 on the security of processing, and Article 22 of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, extending the related obligations to processors, irrespective of their contract with the controller. The proposal introduces an obligation to notify personal data breaches, inspired by the personal data breach notification, clarifying and separating the obligations to notify the supervisory authority and to communicate, in qualified circumstances, to the data subject. It also provides for exemptions on reasons set out in the Directive. Data Protection Officer : the proposal introduces an obligation for the controller to appoint a mandatory data protection officer who should fulfil the tasks listed in the Directive. Where several competent authorities are acting under the supervision of a central authority, functioning as controller, at least this central authority should designate such a data protection officer. Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations : transfers to third countries may take place only if the transfer is necessary for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. The proposal lays down that transfers to a third country may take place in relation to which the Commission has adopted an adequacy decision of the level of protection or, in the absence of such decisions, where appropriate safeguards are in place. It furthermore sets out the criteria for the Commission\u2019s assessment of an adequate or not adequate level of protection, and expressly includes the rule of law, judicial redress and independent supervision. It also provides for the possibility for the Commission to assess the level of protection afforded by a territory or a processing sector within a third country. In addition, the proposed Directive: defines the appropriate safeguards needed prior to international transfers, in the absence of a Commission adequacy decision. These safeguards may be adduced by a legally binding instrument such as an international agreement. Alternatively, the data controller may on the basis of an assessment of the circumstances surrounding the transfer conclude that they exist; spells out the derogations for data transfer; obliges Member States to provide that the controller informs the recipient of any processing restrictions and takes all reasonable steps to ensure that these restrictions are met by recipients of the personal data in the third country or international organisation; explicitly provides for international co-operation mechanisms for the protection of personal data between the Commission and the supervisory authorities of third countries. Independent national supervisory authorities : the proposal obliges Member States to establish supervisory authorities and to enlarge the mission of these authorities to contribute to the consistent application of the Directive throughout the Union, which may be the supervisory authority established under the General Data Protection Regulation. It clarifies the conditions for the independence of supervisory authorities, implementing case law of the Court of Justice. It sets out the competence of the supervisory authorities. It obliges Member States to provide for the duties of the supervisory authority, including hearing and investigating complaints and promoting the awareness of the public on risk, rules, safeguards and rights. A particular duty of the supervisory authorities in the context of this Directive is, where direct access is refused or restricted, to exercise the right of access on behalf of data subjects and to check the lawfulness of the data processing. Co-operation : the proposal introduces rules on mandatory mutual assistance. It provides that the European Data Protection Advisory Board, established by the General Data Protection Regulation, exercises its tasks also in relation to processing activities within the scope of this Directive. Remedies, liability and sanctions : the proposal provides: (i) for the right of any data subject to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (ii) that the bodies, organisations or associations which may lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject and also in case of a personal data breach independently of a data subject's complaint; (iii) for the right to a judicial remedy against a supervisory authority; (iv) the data subject may launch a court action for obliging the supervisory authority to act on a complaint; (v) the right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor; (vi) for the introduction of common rules for court proceedings, including the rights of bodies, organisations or associations to represent data subjects before the courts, and the right of supervisory authorities to engage in legal proceedings; (vii) for the Member States to provide for the right to compensation and lay down rules on penalties, to sanction infringements of the Directive, and to ensure their implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Data Protection Supervisor as specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. These implications require reprogramming of Heading 5 of the Financial Perspective. The total appropriations are estimated at EUR 24.339 million for 2014-2020. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6158EP7, ECR%:0.018, EPP%:0.077, EFD/IDG%:0.29, Greens/EFA%:0.93, NI%:0.333, REG%:0.892, S&D%:0.872, The Left%:0.914, General Majority:0, Left Majority:1, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extended for a period of 6 months (or 7 months in some cases) the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and postponed the completion of certain periodic checks and continuing training which, under the relevant EU legislation, should have taken place during the period between 1 March 2020 (or 1 February 2020 in some cases) and 31 August 2020. Some Member States have submitted reasoned requests to the Commission for authorisation to extend certain periods again. The Commission has adopted six decisions authorising such extensions. Despite some improvements in the situation during the summer of 2020, the persistence of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2020 forced Member States to maintain or even reinforce the measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. As a consequence, transport operators may not be able to complete the formalities or procedures necessary to comply with certain provisions of EU law on the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or approvals, or on the completion of periodic checks and continuous training, or to take other necessary steps to maintain their validity, as was the case in spring 2020. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to adopt measures to remedy these problems and to ensure both legal certainty and the proper functioning of the legal acts concerned. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and to the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in response to the exceptional situation arising from the spread of COVID-19 in the fields of road, rail and inland waterway transport and maritime security during reference periods subsequent to those referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698. The proposal provides for adaptations, in particular for certain time limits, as well as the possibility for the Commission to authorise extensions on the basis of a request submitted by any Member State by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Such extensions should be limited to what is necessary in view of the period during which the completion of formalities, procedures, checks and training are likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, should not exceed six months. The proposal concerns specific provisions which affect the application of several directives and regulations concerning in particular: - the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers for driving licences; - tachographs in road transport; - the periodic technical inspection of motor vehicles and their trailers; - the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; - access to the international road haulage market and access to the international market for coach and bus services; - railway safety, the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union and the rules establishing a single European railway area; - the conditions for obtaining boatmasters' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the Union, technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and the improvement of ship and port facility security. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency so that the situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors are minimised."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6125EP9, ECR%:1.032, EPP%:0.934, EFD/IDG%:0.863, Greens/EFA%:0.932, NI%:0.579, REG%:0.944, S&D%:0.883, The Left%:0.244, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR Regulation) implements in the EU the G20 commitment made in 2009 to increase the stability of the OTC derivatives market. The main objective of EMIR is to reduce systemic risk by increasing the transparency of the OTC derivatives market, through core requirements. They include: (i) central clearing; (ii) margin requirements; (iii) operational risk mitigation requirements; (iv) reporting obligations for derivative contracts; (v) requirements for central counterparties (CCPs); and (vi) requirements for trade repositories. In November 2016, the Commission adopted the EMIR report, which pointed to the need to eliminate disproportionate costs and burdens on small companies and to simplify rules without compromising financial stability. Accordingly, the proposal sets out a series of targeted amendments to the EMIR Regulation, in order to simplify the rules and ensure that the latter are more proportionate. At the same time the proposal maintains all key elements of the framework that have proved to allow achieving the objectives of EMIR. It is related to and consistent with the ongoing initiative to establish a Capital Markets Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment analysis the costs and benefits of areas of EMIR where targeted action could ensure fulfilment of the EMIR objectives in a more proportionate, efficient and effective manner. The analysis shows that it would be possible to obtain a reduction of costs and restrictions, and at the same time, simplify the Regulation. It is estimated that the combined effect of all preferred options, calculated solely for the purpose of the impact assessment, amount to cost reductions ranging from EUR 2.3 billion to EUR 6.9 billion in fixed (one-off) costs and from EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 2.66 billion in operational costs. Overall, businesses, SMEs, and micro-enterprises will, in particular, benefit from (i) reducing regulatory requirements in cases where disproportionate compliance costs appear to outweigh prudential benefits and (ii) improving access to clearing. There should be no significant relevant social and economic cost. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in order to simplify the rules applicable to over the counter derivatives and make them more proportionate in order to reduce costs and regulatory burden weighing on market participants, without putting at risk financial stability. The proposal simplifies reporting requirements for all counterparties. It re-focuses the scope of the clearing obligation for financial counterparties to include some additional relevant market players while exempting the smallest financial counterparties. Specifically the proposal: removes the requirement to report historic transactions, i.e. transactions that were not outstanding on the starting date of the reporting obligation on 12 February 2014; introduces improvements to ensure the quality of reported data for trade repositories; establishes single-sided reporting by the central counterparties for exchange-traded derivatives transactions ('ETDs'); provides that, for transactions other than ETD transactions, the responsibility for reporting transactions between a small non-financial counterparty (i.e. not subject to the clearing obligation) and a financial counterparty should be on the financial counterparty to the trade; exempts intragroup transactions involving any non-financial counterparties from the reporting obligation; provides, with regards to non-financial counterparties, that only non-hedging contracts are counted towards the thresholds triggering the clearing obligation; introduces a new three\u2013year temporary exemption for pension funds from central clearing; increases the upper limit of basic amount of fines for infringements of EMIR requirements by trade repositories; clarifies the interaction between EMIR default management tools and national insolvency laws to ensure the insolvency remoteness of client assets; requires observance of the principle to provide clearing services under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms ('FRAND' principle). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 7407EP8, ECR%:0.943, EPP%:0.873, EFD/IDG%:0.125, Greens/EFA%:0.9, NI%:0.096, REG%:0.761, S&D%:0.895, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 setting up the European GNSS Agency. PARLIAMENT\u2019S ROLE: BACKGROUND: security requirements play an essential role in the design, implementation and operation of the infrastructures emerging from the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. The provisions of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 expressly lay down the terms under which the Agency must perform its task concerning security accreditation of the systems. In order to ensure that the security accreditation activities are performed in an independent manner, including, to a large extent, the Regulation provides the Agency with an independent body, the Security Accreditation Board, which constitutes one of the three separate roles of the Agency along with the Executive Director and the Administrative Board. On 30 November 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on the implementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems. This future GNSS Regulation will replace Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 as of 1 January 2012 and determine the governance framework during the 2014-2020 period. In particular, it stipulates that most of the tasks associated with the operation of both the Galileo and EGNOS systems will be entrusted to the European GNSS Agency. The commitment expressed by the Commission in its proposal to delegating these tasks to the Agency is shared by the European Parliament and the Council. In this new context, it is essential to ensure that the Security Accreditation Board is able to carry out the task entrusted to it with complete independence, in particular vis-\u00e0-vis the other bodies and activities of the Agency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission's proposal was not subject to an impact assessment; nor did it follow formal consultation of the parties concerned. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 with a view ensuring the independence of the exercise of activities relating to security systems accreditation as well as the separation between these activities and other activities of the European GNSS Agency. To do so, the proposal provides mainly for an increase in the powers of the Security Accreditation Board and those of the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board, by partly aligning them with those of the Administrative Board and the Executive Director respectively, while providing for a cooperation requirement between the various bodies of the Agency. Security Accreditation Board: it is proposed that this Board, and not the Administrative Board prepares and approves the part of the Agency work programmes describing the operational activities associated with security accreditation of the systems as well as the part of the annual report concerning the activities and prospects of the Agency with regard to the systems' security accreditation activities and submits them in good time to the Administrative Board so that they can be incorporated in the Agency's work programme and annual report. Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board: it would be desirable to assign a role in relation to security accreditation activities to the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board comparable to that of the Executive Director in other Agency activities. Therefore, in addition to the function of representing the Agency, already provided for under Regulation (EU) No 912/2010, the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board should: manage the security accreditation activities under the direction of the Security Accreditation Board and ensure the implementation of the part of the Agency work programmes associated with accreditation; at the request of the Parliament or the Council, submit a report on the performance of its tasks and make a declaration before these institutions. Furthermore, given the involvement of a number of third countries in the European GNSS programmes, including in security matters, express provision should be made for representatives of third countries to be able to participate under conditions to be specified in the work of the Security Accreditation Board. Lastly, Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 must be made consistent with the principles contained in the shared approach of the Parliament, Council and Commission to the decentralised agencies, adopted by the three institutions on 5 July, 26 June and 12 June 2012 respectively. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the legislative financial statement associated with Regulation (EU) No 912/2010, which accompanies the proposal and incorporates the new staff requirements of the Agency relating to the new tasks which may be entrusted to it, such as the exploitation of the European GNSS systems, translates these requirements in financial terms. In budgetary terms, the amounts required are already included in the Commission's proposal for the next financial framework 2014-2020. They will be financed by redeployment within the budget headings of the GNSS programmes in the same way as the additional requirements for 2013. It should be noted that the expenditure associated with the new staff requirements of the Agency will be partially offset by a reduction of 30 posts in the Commission's establishment plan during the same period, i.e. from 2014 to 2020. The total estimated impact on the Agency\u2019s budget (operational and administrative expenditure) amounts to EUR 204.318 million for the period 2013-2020. This estimate is provisional because it is dependent on the adoption of the next multiannual finanancial framework 2014-2020 by the budgetary authority."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6181EP7, ECR%:0.86, EPP%:0.872, EFD/IDG%:0.548, Greens/EFA%:0.965, NI%:0.485, REG%:0.892, S&D%:0.908, The Left%:0.343, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Jordan relations are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Jordan signed an Association Agreement with the Union on 24 November 1997, which entered into force on 1 May 2002. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan. The Jordanian economy has been particularly affected by the conflict that has been raging in Syria since 2011. This regional unrest has caused a considerable deterioration in external revenues and strained public finances. They have affected tourism and foreign direct investment. Regardless of these conflicts, the supply of natural gas from Egypt has been disrupted for several years. In addition, the Jordanian economy has faced a massive influx of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on public finances, public services and infrastructure. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Union has made available more than EUR 2.1 billion to Jordan under different instruments (including EUR 380 million under the two aforementioned MFA programmes) to help the country preserve economic stability, sustain political and economic reform and address its related humanitarian, development and security needs. In addition, the European Investment Bank has allocated around EUR 486 million in project loans to Jordan. A recent evaluation of the implementation of MFA operations concluded that the first MFA programme was adapted to Jordan's economic challenges and in line with EU priorities. The evaluation also found that the programme had been implemented efficiently and in close coordination with the Jordanian authorities, had contributed to preserving macroeconomic stability and has had a positive social impact. In July 2019, given its still difficult economic situation and prospects, Jordan requested further macro-financial assistance from the Union. In this context, the Commission considers that the continued support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Jordan's international partners, of which the EU remains essential. CONTENT: the European Commission proposes to provide Jordan with additional macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 500 million in three instalments in the form of medium and long-term loans. The EU MFA is an exceptional emergency aid instrument designed to respond to serious balance of payments difficulties in third countries. The objective of the proposed MFA is to help Jordan cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2020-2021, reducing the economy\u2019s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities as well as contributing to the debt sustainability. In addition, EU assistance would encourage Jordan to step up its reform efforts through a Memorandum of Understanding, to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities and shall include a package of measures to promote economic adjustment and the implementation of structural reforms. MFA funds shall be made available in the form of low-interest and long-term loans. Disbursements under the proposed programme shall be strictly conditional on the implementation of specific conditions, to be agreed between the EU and Jordan and set out in a Memorandum of Understanding. These conditions should be in line not only with the priorities of the EU-Jordan Partnership, as confirmed at the Brussels III Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region, held from 12 to 14 March 2019, and at the EU-Jordan Association Council on 17 July 2019, but also with the adjustment programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 458EP9, ECR%:0.903, EPP%:0.885, EFD/IDG%:0.836, Greens/EFA%:1.0, NI%:0.421, REG%:1.009, S&D%:0.935, The Left%:0.61, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Tonga were opened on 19 November 2014 in Brussels. During that meeting the entire draft text could be reviewed and agreement was reached on all its aspects. After a number of subsequent informal exchanges, the agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 29 May 2015 (Tonga) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Tongo on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Tongo when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Tonga may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Tonga to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Tongo remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Tongo to stay only in those Member States\u2019 European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3418EP8, ECR%:0.543, EPP%:0.896, EFD/IDG%:0.5, Greens/EFA%:0.92, NI%:0.173, REG%:0.91, S&D%:0.89, The Left%:0.942, General Majority:0, Left Majority:1, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stability and Growth Pact has been further strengthened by Regulation No 1175/2011 and Regulation (EU) No 1177/2011 on the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Regulation (EC) No 1173/2011 on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area added a system of effective, preventive and gradual enforcement mechanisms in the form of financial sanctions for the Member States whose currency is the euro. These provisions have created a more robust framework at the level of the Union for the surveillance of national economic policies. The Treaty allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area that go beyond the provisions applicable to all Member States in order to ensure the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. Strong public finances are best ensured at the planning stage and gross errors should be identified as early as possible . Setting-up a common budgetary timeline for Member States whose currency is the euro should better synchronize the key steps in the preparation of national budgets, thus contributing to the effectiveness of the European semester for budgetary policy coordination. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136 in conjunction with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed regulation builds on what has already been agreed in the \u2018Six Pack\u2019 set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December 2011. It contains provisions to enhance both the coordination and the surveillance of budgetary processes for all euro area Member States: \u00b7 complementing the European semester with a common budgetary timeline; \u00b7 complementing the multilateral surveillance system of budgetary policies with additional monitoring requirements in order to ensure that Union policy recommendations in the budgetary area are appropriately integrated in the national budgetary preparations; \u00b7 complementing the procedure for correction of a Member State's excessive deficit by a closer monitoring of budgetary policies of Member States subject to an excessive deficit procedure in order to secure a timely durable correction of excessive deficits. The proposed regulation would require Member States whose currency is the euro to present their draft budgets at the same time each year (by 15 April) and gives the Commission the right to assess and, if necessary, issue an opinion on them. The Commission could request that these drafts be revised, should it consider them to be seriously non-compliant with the policy obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. All of this would be done publically to ensure full transparency. The Eurogroup shall discuss opinions of the Commission on the national budgetary plans and the budgetary situation and prospects in the euro area as a whole on the basis of the overall assessment made by the Commission The proposal also contains new monitoring requirements \u2013 based on an obligation to communicate information to the Commission \u2013 to allow assessments to be made about the content and direction of fiscal policy at any point while a Member State is under an Excessive Deficit Procedure. Member States of the euro area must have in place an independent fiscal council for monitoring the implementation of national fiscal rules and base their budgets on independent macroeconomic forecasts. In order to enhance the dialogue between the Union institutions, in particular the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and to ensure greater transparency and accountability, the competent committee of the European Parliament may offer the opportunity to the Member State concerned by a Commission recommendation to participate in an exchange of views.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates - a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges - are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6625EP7, ECR%:0.246, EPP%:0.857, EFD/IDG%:0.258, Greens/EFA%:0.947, NI%:0.242, REG%:0.904, S&D%:0.872, The Left%:0.771, General Majority:0, Left Majority:1, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is ensured. Currently citizens face different practical problems with asset planning when they are in an international marriage or partnership. The problem is that it is very difficult for people to know which courts have jurisdiction and which laws are applicable to their personal situation and the situation of their property. As a result, they face unintended, and disadvantageous, consequences not only in the daily management of their assets but also when the couple separates or a member of the couple dies. On 16 March 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of matrimonial property regimes and a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions regarding the property consequences of registered partnerships. The European Parliament delivered its favourable opinion and comments on the two proposals on 10 September 2013. However, the Council concluded at its meeting of 3 December 2015 that it would not be possible to reach an EU-wide agreement in relation to both regulations within a reasonable period of time. To date, the Commission has received requests from 17 Member States indicating their wish to establish enhanced cooperation: Sweden, Belgium, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, Malta, Luxembourg, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria and Finland. The Commission concluded that all the legal conditions set by the Treaties for the authorisation of the establishment of enhanced cooperation are fulfilled. It considered that the benefits of establishing enhanced cooperation are numerous compared to the option of keeping the status quo and that the advantages of establishing enhanced cooperation in this area outweigh any possible disadvantage. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision \u2013 based on Article 329(1), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) \u2013 seeks to authorise enhanced cooperation between 17 requesting Member States in the area of jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the property regimes of international couples, covering both matters of matrimonial property regimes and the property consequences of registered partnerships. Proposals for specific measures implementing the enhanced cooperation are submitted together with this proposal. According to the Commission, enhanced cooperation would bring citizens the following benefits: Enhanced cooperation shall be open at any time to all Member States, in accordance with Article 328 of the TFEU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3381EP8, ECR%:0.086, EPP%:0.855, EFD/IDG%:0.458, Greens/EFA%:0.92, NI%:0.173, REG%:0.925, S&D%:0.89, The Left%:0.885, General Majority:0, Left Majority:1, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal aims at enabling Greenland to participate in the Kimberley Process certification scheme on rough diamonds through its cooperation with the European Union. The scheme set out in the proposal would allow for the import and export of rough diamonds from Greenland to the Union as well as to other participants of the certification scheme, provided that all imports and exports of rough diamonds are verified and, for exports, certified by Union authorities pursuant to the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the international trade in rough diamonds. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Greenland and Denmark undertake to transpose and implement in the legislation applicable to Greenland the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the conditions and formalities for importing and exporting rough diamonds, their transit to a participant other than the Union, the participation of the Union, including Greenland, in the Kimberley Process certification scheme and associated obligations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal extends the territory of the Union to also cover the territory of Greenland for the purposes of the Kimberley Process certification scheme. Accordingly, Greenland will be prohibited to accept imports or exports of rough diamonds to or from outside of the territory of the Union without a valid Kimberley Process (KP) certificate. The amendments will allow for the export of rough diamonds from Greenland to third countries as long as they are accompanied by an EU KP certificate. The conditions for certification previously required evidence that the rough diamonds were lawfully imported into the Union. For diamonds mined and extracted in Greenland that have never been exported before, an alternative condition is introduced by this proposal, notably to demonstrate proof in this regard. In addition, the proposal: sets out the modalities of submitting rough diamonds to Union authorities for verification, extends the special rules for transit to Greenland. enables Greenland's participation in the Committee for the implementation of the Regulation, and enables Greenland's representation in the Kimberley Process and cooperation with other Member States through the Commission. The proposal is closely connected to a proposal for a Council Decision setting out specific rules for the circulation of rough diamonds between the Union and Greenland.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Ukraine continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. An Association Agreement between the Union and Ukraine, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), entered into force on 1 September 2017. Since spring 2014, Ukraine has embarked on an ambitious reform programme aiming to stabilise its economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens. In addition to its political support, the Union pledged over EUR 11 billion financial package in March 2014 to support economic stabilisation and reform implementation in Ukraine, including 1.6 billion of macro-financial assistance pursuant to Council Decision 2002/639/EC, Decision No 646/2010/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and pursuant to Council Decision 2014/215/EU. In view of Ukraine's substantial external financing needs, an additional EUR 1.8 billion of macro-financial assistance (MFA) was made available to the country in April 2015 pursuant to Decision (EU) 2015/601 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Since May 2014, Ukraine has received EUR 2.81 billion of macro-financial assistance from the Union , including EUR 1.2 billion out of the EUR 1.8 billion available under Decision (EU) 2015/601. Ukraine fulfilled 17 of the 21 policy commitments attached to the third tranche of EUR 600 million that could have been made available to Ukraine under the third MFA operation. Although four measures were not implemented by the time the availability period of the assistance expired in January 2018. Under these circumstances, the Commission was not in a position to disburse the last tranche under the third MFA operation. Given that a residual external financing gap remains in Ukraine\u2019s balance of payments over and above the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Ukraine is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Ukraine\u2019s request for support to its economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. The Union\u2019s macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Ukraine, supplementing resources made available under the IMF\u2019s financial arrangement. CONTENT: under the proposed Decision, the European Union shall make MFA available to Ukraine for a total amount of up to EUR 1 billion, provided in the form of medium- to long-term loans. The objective of the proposed AMF is to: help Ukraine cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2018-2019 , reducing the economy\u2019s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities; provide incentives to step up Ukraine's reform efforts by agreeing with the Ukrainian authorities a Memorandum of Understanding setting out an appropriate package of measures supporting economic adjustment and structural reforms. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments. Provided the policy measures attached to each tranche have been implemented in a timely manner, the first instalment is expected to be disbursed in the second half of 2018, while the second instalment could be released in the first half of 2019. All disbursements under the proposed programme, including the first, would be conditional on the implementation of reform measures designed to address vulnerabilities identified in the Ukrainian economy. These reforms, established in a Memorandum of Understanding, will have to take into account the measures of the previous MFA operation that have not yet been implemented, namely the establishment of a system for verifying asset declarations of public officials and a verification of data to be provided by companies on their beneficial owners. The issue wood export ban shall also be examined. The MFA may only be completed if major reforms in the fight against corruption and governance are well implemented. In addition, the Memorandum for the new programme will also include other measures to be implemented by Ukraine in order to receive the first and second disbursement. These will comprise actions in the area of public finance management. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of loans and should be financed through borrowing operations that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed into the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (\u201cProvisioning of the Guarantee Fund\u201d). Assuming that the first loan disbursements will be made in 2018 for a total amount of EUR 500 million and the second loan disbursement in 2019 for the amount of EUR 500 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the budgets for 2020 (EUR 45 million) and 2021 (EUR 45 million). The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 90.997 million for the period 2017-2021."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 7428EP8, ECR%:0.857, EPP%:0.851, EFD/IDG%:0.042, Greens/EFA%:0.9, NI%:0.096, REG%:0.896, S&D%:0.864, The Left%:0.038, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for investigational medicinal products intended to be used in clinical trials in the Union. According to the Regulation, read in conjunction with the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol to the UK Withdrawal Agreement, the importation of investigational medicinal products from third countries into the Union or Northern Ireland is subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021), including for import requirements for investigational medicinal products, in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it is still proving very difficult for some operators currently based in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland to adapt as required by the Protocol. An interruption in the supply of investigational medicinal products would present a potential risk to the safety and well-being of participants in ongoing clinical trials and would hamper the establishment of new clinical trials in these Member States and Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 aims to provide for exemptions for medicinal products distributed in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta that are used as investigational medicinal products in clinical trials in those countries. Specifically, the proposal provides that the importation of investigational medicinal products from other parts of the United Kingdom into Northern Ireland and, until 31 December 2024, into Cyprus, Ireland and Malta is not subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation, provided that the following conditions are met: - the investigational medicinal products have undergone certification of batch release either in the Union or in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to verify compliance with the requirements set out in Article 63(1); - the investigational medicinal products are only made available to clinical trial participants in the Member State into which the investigational medicinal products are imported or, if imported into Northern Ireland, are only made available to clinical trial participants in Northern Ireland. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to introduce exemptions from certain obligations relating to medicinal products for human use available in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland, as well as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 12523EP9, ECR%:0.774, EPP%:0.797, EFD/IDG%:0.562, Greens/EFA%:0.851, NI%:0.456, REG%:0.824, S&D%:0.734, The Left%:0.732, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:1"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2017/2397 lays down transitional measures concerning the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued before 18 January 2022 (the day following the expiry of the period for the transposition of the Directive). In general, the documents concerned remain valid on the EU inland waterways for which they were valid before that date, for a maximum of 10 years. However, apart from the Rhine navigation licences referred to in Directive 96/50/EC, those transitional measures do not apply to the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries that are currently recognised by Member States under their national requirements established before the entry into force of the Directive or their international agreements. Consequently, from 17 January 2022, third country documents will be recognised in the EU only once the Commission has adopted an implementing act under the Directive granting recognition in the EU to the documents issued by that third country. Given that the procedure for recognition of third country documents is based on the assessment of the certification systems in the requesting third country, it is unlikely that the recognition procedure will be completed before 17 January 2022. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to introduce transitional provisions applicable to third country documents recognised in certain Member States before 18 January 2022, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the system of recognition of third country documents provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and to avoid any disruption of the labour market in the inland waterway transport sector. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States to continue to recognise third country documents based on their national requirements established before the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 (16 January 2018). The recognition should be limited to inland waterways situated in the territory of the Member State concerned and should not apply beyond 17 January 2032. The scope of this transitional measure could only cover documents issued by a third country before the cut-off date (18 January 2023). The proposed amendment clarifies that certificates of qualification issued by a third country in exchange for the certificates covered by the transitional arrangements should be valid on all inland EU waterways, provided that the third country concerned has obtained recognition in accordance with Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and that the requirements for the exchange applied by that third country have been found to be identical to those laid down in the Directive with regard to the Member States."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 9419EP9, ECR%:1.016, EPP%:0.951, EFD/IDG%:0.37, Greens/EFA%:0.932, NI%:0.526, REG%:0.954, S&D%:0.922, The Left%:0.951, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: uncertainty about the scope of the Directive, lack of clarity on legal provisions and definitions as well as disparities in Member States' approaches to product compliance and potential duplication of procedure with other pieces of EU legislation such as REACH, generate unnecessary administrative costs. If the RoHS Directive is not reviewed, environmental benefits reaped from the legislation will remain sub-optimal. Uncertainty among manufacturers about legal requirements for demonstrating compliance with the RoHS Directive and about enforcement methodologies in the 27 Member States will persist, maintaining or increasing administrative burden. The RoHS recast will enhance its complementarity and coherence with other relevant Community legislation, such as the \"Marketing of Products Package\" (regarding definitions and enforcement), REACH (regarding the use of substances), the Energy-using Products (EuP) Directive regarding the design of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), and legislation related to management of waste from EEE. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden and make the RoHS Directive more cost effective. CONTENT: the basic objectives and mechanisms of this Directive have not been changed. The ultimate aim is the elimination of certain hazardous substances from electrical and electronic equipment; where this is temporarily not possible, exemptions are granted. No new substances are proposed to be banned. The main proposed modifications are as follows: Harmonisation of the scope : two new annexes describing the Directive\u2019s scope are added, the first describing the broad product categories and the second, amendable by the Commission, providing binding product lists within each category. Medical devices and control and monitoring instruments are included to reap the environmental and health benefits from the reduction of use of hazardous substances in such equipment, but in a gradual manner so that adverse socioeconomic impacts are avoided. Definitions : the definitions for economic operators are aligned to the \"Marketing of products\" package and new definitions, such as for \"medical devices\" and \"homogeneous material\" are added. Harmonised definitions, coherent with related Community legislation, enhance legal clarity and reduce administrative cost. Substance ban : maximum concentration values for the banned substances are set (incorporation in the Directive of a Commission Decision) and permission to use non-compliant spare parts is extended to equipment benefiting from an exemption when placed on the market, to prevent premature withdrawal of equipment from use. A new annex with exemptions specific to the new product categories (medical devices and control and monitoring instruments) is added for cases where substitution is currently not feasible. A mechanism for introducing new substance bans in line with the REACH methodology is inserted to ensure coherence and maximise synergy with the work carried out under the chemicals' legislation. Detailed rules of this process will be developed through comitology. When developing these detailed rules, the Commission will give priority to using the expertise available at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The Commission will invite ECHA to evaluate the substances concerned as a priority. Exemptions mechanism : a 4-year maximum validity period for the exemptions is set to stimulate substitution efforts, provide legal security and shift the burden of proof to the applicant, in line with REACH. New criteria such as availability and reliability for granting exemptions are introduced to take into account broader socio-economic aspects. A mandate is given to the Commission for establishing detailed rules for the applicants to apply when requesting an exemption for facilitating them and speeding up the scrutiny process. Evaluation of product conformity and market surveillance mechanisms : new provisions introduce product conformity assessment requirements and market surveillance mechanisms in line with the \"Marketing of products\" package. Reducing the number of non-compliant products through strengthened and harmonised market surveillance is a cost effective way of increasing the environmental benefit of the Directive. Harmonised conformity assessment requirements increase legal certainty and reduce the administrative cost for Member States and manufacturers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 1144EP7, ECR%:0.842, EPP%:0.901, EFD/IDG%:0.323, Greens/EFA%:0.877, NI%:0.303, REG%:0.88, S&D%:0.892, The Left%:0.829, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was signed on 20 December 2013. Illicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than \u20ac10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries. Since the illicit products mostly originate from countries outside the EU, international cooperation, in particular also based on clear legislative procedures, is key to addressing the problem of illicit trade. The FCTC Protocol currently constitutes the only multilateral regulatory initiative in the area. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. This Decision applies to the provisions of the Protocol which do not fall within the scope of Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Freedom, Security and Justice). The Protocol contains a complex set of measures, rules and policy in the field of fighting illicit trade in tobacco products. The Protocol provisions fall into different areas of EU activity which may be subdivided as follows: The Protocol: Those articles are complemented by provisions on: (i) record-keeping and security and preventive measures, including anti-money-laundering measures and reporting of suspicious transactions; (ii) sales by Internet; (iii) duty free sales of tobacco products and the obligation to implement effective controls on tobacco and tobacco products in the free zones, including not mixing tobacco products with non-tobacco products at the time of removal from a free zone. Part IV of the Protocol defines the conduct to be established as unlawful under the Parties\u2019 legislation and obliges the Parties to ensure that natural and legal persons are held liable for such unlawful conduct, including criminal offences. Further provisions concern seizure payments, the handling of confiscated tobacco and special investigative techniques. Part V of the Protocol contains provisions for the exchange of relevant information between the Parties, cooperation and mutual assistance (both administrative and legal in relation to criminal matters), jurisdiction and extradition. In parallel to this proposal, the Commission presented a separate proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol, on behalf of the European Union, as regards provisions which fall under Title V of Part III of the TFEU."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3378EP8, ECR%:0.729, EPP%:0.851, EFD/IDG%:0.896, Greens/EFA%:0.86, NI%:0.327, REG%:0.851, S&D%:0.864, The Left%:0.846, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: Article 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as \"delegated acts\" (Article 290(3)). Article 291 of the TFEU allows Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as \"implementing acts\" (Article 291(4)). As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred upon the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 774/94 need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t here was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact analysis since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) 774/94 with the TFEU is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal consists in aligning Council Regulation (EC) No. 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty. Regulation (EC) No 774/94 confers powers on the Commission allowing it to adopt the necessary implementing measures. It also confers powers on the Commission to adopt adjustments to that Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular by a decision to approve an agreement with one or more third countries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 774/94, the relevant implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Commission adopted, on Tuesday 6 November, a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. This proposal has been subject to in-depth discussions with the Working Groups in the Council and the \u201cJustice and Home Affairs\u201d Council reviewed, in January, July and November 2008, the work carried out on this issue. The discussions enable a consensus to be reached on many of the provisions. Following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the 1 December 2009, the 2007 draft framework proposal, which had not yet been adopted by the Council, became obsolete. This new proposal replaces it and is based on the provisions of the TFEU. It takes into account the views expressed by Member States in Council discussions on the draft Framework decision, as well as the recommendations of the European Parliament as stated in its Resolution of 20 November 2008 and the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Over the last decade the EU and other parts of the world have seen an increase in serious and organised crime, such as trafficking in human beings and drugs. This proposal responds to a request for increased cooperation on organised crime and terrorism. As a response to the threat posed by serious crime and terrorism, and the abolition of internal border controls under the Schengen Convention, the EU adopted measures such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), and the anticipated Entry/Exit System are examples of such measures. The \u2018Stockholm Programme\u2019 also calls on the Commission to present a proposal for the use of PNR data to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorism and serious crime. PNR data is unverified information provided by passengers, and collected by and held in the carriers\u2019 reservation and departure control systems for their own commercial purposes. It contains several different types of information, such as travel dates, travel itinerary, ticket information, contact details, the travel agent at which the flight was booked, means of payment used, seat number and baggage information. More systematic collection, use and retention of PNR data with respect to international flights, subject to strict data protection guarantees, would strengthen the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and is necessary to meet those threats to security and reduce the harm they cause. Given that the use of PNR data is not currently regulated at EU level, it is necessary to harmonise Member States\u2019 provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal does not require air carriers to collect any additional information from passengers or to retain any data, nor does it require passengers to provide any data in addition to that already being provided to air carriers. In order to ensure compliance with the principle of proportionality, the proposal is therefore carefully limited in scope and contains strict data protection guarantees. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four main options were examined in the Impact Assessment, each containing two variables: Option A : refraining from addressing the issue at EU level and maintaining the status quo. Option B : addressing the structure of a system for collecting and processing PNR data: with option B.1: Decentralised collection and processing of data by Member States; with option B.2: Centralised collection and processing of data at EU level. Option C : addressing limitation of the purpose of the proposed measures: with option C.1: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime only; with option C.2: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and other policy objectives. Option D : addressing the modes of transport to be covered by the proposed measures: with option D.1: Air carriers only; with option D.2: Air, sea and rail carriers. The options were assessed against the following criteria: security in the EU, protection of personal data, costs to public authorities, costs for carriers/competition in the internal market and encouraging a global approach. The Impact Assessment concluded that a legislative proposal applicable to travel by air with decentralised collection of PNR data for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and other serious crime was the best policy option (combination of B1, C1 and D1). This would enhance security in the EU, while limiting the impact on the protection of personal data to the minimum and keeping costs at an acceptable level. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Directive contains several chapters which may be summarised as follows: Chapter I - General provisions : t he proposal aims to harmonise Member States\u2019 provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Passenger Name Record data as set out in the annex of the proposal include, inter alia: PNR record locator; date of reservation/issue of ticket; date(s) of intended travel; name(s); addresses; billing information; seat numbers; etc. Other general remarks are also made including all available information on unaccompanied minors under 18 years, such as name and gender of the minor, age, name and contact details of guardian on departure and relationship to the minor, name and contact details of guardian on arrival and relationship to the minor, departure and arrival agent). Chapter II - Responsibilities : On Member States :e ach Member State shall set up or designate an authority competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime or a branch of such an authority to act as its \u2018Passenger Information Unit\u2019 responsible for collecting PNR data from the air carriers, storing them, analysing them and transmitting the result of the analysis to the competent authorities. The PNR data transferred by the air carriers in relation to international flights which land on or depart from the territory of each Member State shall be collected by the Passenger Information Unit of the relevant Member State. Should the PNR data transferred by air carriers include data beyond those listed in the Annex, the Passenger Information Unit shall delete such data immediately upon receipt. Member States shall ensure that the assessment criteria are set by the Passenger Information Units, in cooperation with the competent authorities. The assessment criteria shall in no circumstances be based on a person\u2019s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. The Passenger Information Unit of a Member State shall transfer the PNR data or the results of the processing of PNR data of the persons identified for the purpose of further examination to the relevant competent authorities of the same Member State. Such transfers shall only be made on a case-by- case basis. Obligations on air carriers :M ember States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that air carriers transfer ('push') the PNR data to the extent that such data are already collected by them, to the database of the national Passenger Information Unit of the Member State on the territory of which the international flight will land or from the territory of which the flight will depart. Air carriers shall transfer PNR data by electronic means using the common protocols and supported data formats to be adopted, or in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means ensuring an appropriate level of data security: (a) 24 to 48 hours before the scheduled time for flight departure; and (b) immediately after flight closure, that is once the passengers have boarded the aircraft in preparation for departure and it is no longer possible for further passengers to board. Member States may permit air carriers to limit the transfer to updates of the transfers. On a case-by-case basis, upon request from a Passenger Information Unit in accordance with national law, air carriers shall transfer PNR data where access earlier than that mentioned is necessary to assist in responding to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or serious crime. Transfer of data to third countries : it is explicitly stated that a Member State may transfer PNR data to a third country under strict and limited conditions and with express authorisation from the Member States for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. Period of data retention : Member States shall ensure that the PNR data provided by the air carriers to the Passenger Information Unit are retained in a database at the Passenger Information Unit for a period of 30 days after their transfer to the Passenger Information Unit of the first Member State on whose territory the international flight is landing or departing. Upon expiry of the period of 30 days after the transfer of the PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the data shall be retained at the Passenger Information Unit for a further period of five years. During this period, all data elements which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR data relate shall be masked out. Access to the full PNR data shall be permitted only by the Head of the Passenger Information Unit for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of a terrorist offence or serious crime, and to provide the competent authorities with the results of such processing; and where it could be reasonably believed that it is necessary to carry out an investigation or prosecution. Penalties against air carriers : penalties are provided for against air carriers which, do not transmit the data required under this Directive, to the extent that they are already collected by the them, or do not do so in the required format or otherwise infringe the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Protection of personal data : the proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Each Member State shall provide that, in respect of all processing of personal data pursuant to this Directive, every passenger shall have the same right to access, the right to rectification, erasure and blocking, the right to compensation and the right to judicial redress as those adopted under national law in implementation of Articles 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. The draft Decision lays down a number of provisions which aim to: prohibit any processing of PNR data revealing a person\u2019s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life; ensure the traceability of all processing of PNR data by air carriers, all transfers of PNR data by Passenger Information Units and all requests by competent authorities or Passenger Information Units of other Member States and third countries; ensure that air carriers, their agents or other ticket sellers for the carriage of passengers on air service inform passengers of international flights at the time of booking a flight and at the time of purchase of a ticket in a clear and precise manner about the provision of PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the purposes of their processing, the period of data retention, their possible use to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime, the possibility of exchanging and sharing such data and their data protection rights, in particular the right to complain to a national data protection supervisory authority of their choice; lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to be imposed in case of infringements of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Chapter IV - Implementing measures : this chapter concerns common protocols and supported data formats. All transfers of PNR data by air carriers to the Passenger Information Units for the purposes of this Directive shall be made by electronic means or, in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means, for a period of one year following the adoption of the common protocols and supported data formats. The technical provisions of comitology are also provided to this effect. Chapter V - Final provisions : Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive at the latest two years after the entry into force of this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive. There will be a transitional period for the proposal in the form of a two year implementation period. There will also be a transitional collection of PNR data, aiming to achieve collection of data on all flights within 6 years from the entry into force of the Directive. The proposal includes a review clause providing for a review of the operation of the Directive four years after its transposition date and a special review of the potential extension of the scope of the Directive to cover PNR data of passengers on flights internal to the EU. Member States shall prepare a set of statistical information on PNR data provided to the Passenger Information Units. Territorial application : the application of the Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols Nos 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the need to rapidly achieve the Banking Union to ensure financial stability and growth in the euro area as well as throughout the single market was underlined by the Commission in its communications entitled \u201cA Roadmap towards a Banking Union\u201d (September 2012) and \u201cA blueprint for a deep and genuine economic and monetary union: Launching a European Debate\u201d (November 2012). In March 2013, the European Council committed to complete the Banking Union via the following steps. the remaining legislative procedures to set up the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) conferring powers on the ECB to supervise Euro Area banks should be concluded as a priority; agreement should be reached in the summer of 2013 on how the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could, following the establishment of the SSM and a review of bank balance sheets including the definition of \u201clegacy assets\u201d, recapitalise banks directly; likewise, in summer 2013, agreement should be reached on the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms; lastly, the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) together with appropriate and effective backstop arrangements should be examined as a matter of priority with the intention of adopting them during the current parliamentary cycle. It was agreed that the Banking Union would cover all Euro Area Member States and those non-Euro Area Member States that choose to join. As recognised by the European Council, in the Banking Union, bank supervision and resolution need to be exercised by the same level of authority. The same EU-wide single rulebook of prudential requirements 6 and rules on bank resolution will apply within the Banking Union and in all other Member States. The swift agreement on a Single Supervisory Mechanism in April 2012 has laid the ground for a Banking Union, as integral part of the Economic and Monetary Union. The Single Supervisory Mechanism is set to enter into force in mid-2014. The ECB will assume ultimate responsibility for the supervision of all Euro Area banks. The Single Resolution Mechanism meanwhile should commence operations in January 2015, when the Directive which will provide the rulebook governing bank resolution across the internal market is set to enter into force IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has taken into account the analysis carried out in the Impact Assessment conducted for the adoption of the proposal for Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms which assessed operational and legal aspects relevant to the establishment of a single resolution mechanism (SRM). With regard to the ability of the SRM to produce efficient decisions, it is considered that a central decision-making level will contribute to minimizing the costs of resolution both since it can attain significant advantages in terms of economies of scale over a network, and because it is instrumental to the enforceability and optimality of the resolution decision. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to preserve the integrity of the Member States banking markets participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) by the putting in place of a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to deal with failing banks. The SRM would permit the application of uniform rules to any bank in difficulty in a participating Member State and to proceed effectively towards the resolution of bank failures in such a way as to minimise the cost for the taxpayer and for the real economy. Structure of the SRM: the composition of the SRM ensures that its decision-making structures are legally sound and effective, including in times of crisis. The decision-making structures of the Single Resolution Mechanism include the Single Resolution Board, the national resolution authorities of participating Member States and the European Commission. The tasks of the SRM are shared between Single Resolution Board and the national resolution authorities. The European Commission will participate in the SRM only in so far as needed to perform specific tasks provided for in this proposed Regulation and in relation to State aid scrutiny under the Treaty. Resolution - operation and procedure: to ensure that all participating Member States have full confidence in the quality and impartiality of the bank resolution process, resolution decisions will be prepared and monitored centrally by a Single Resolution Board to ensure a coherent and uniform approach is applied. The objective of resolution is to ensure the continuity of the bank\u2019s critical functions, to protect financial stability, to minimise reliance on taxpayers\u2019 money, and to protect depositors. Resolution is triggered by means of the following process : the ECB, as bank supervisor, notifies that a bank is failing to Commission, to the Resolution Board and to the relevant national authorities and ministries; the Resolution Board assesses if there is a systemic threat and no private sector solution and, if so, the Resolution Board recommends to the Commission to initiate resolution; on the basis of the Resolution Board\u2019s recommendations, or of its own initiative, the Commission will have the power to initiate the resolution procedure; in this case, it would also indicate to the Resolution Board the framework of the resolution tools that will be applied in each case and on the use of the Fund; the national resolution authorities execute the resolution measures decided by the Board according to the national law. If the national resolution authorities do not comply with the decisions of the Board, the Board has the power to supersede the national resolution authorities and address certain decisions for the implementation of the resolution measures directly to the banks. Single Bank Resolution Fund: to support the resolution process and enhance its effectiveness, the proposed Regulation establishes a Single Bank Resolution Fund. This Fund will be able to pool significant resources from bank contributions and therefore protect taxpayers more effectively than national funds, while at the same time providing a level playing field for banks across participating Member States. The primary objective of the Single Resolution Fund is to ensure financial stability, rather than to absorb losses or provide capital to an institution under resolution. The Fund should not be considered as a bailout fund. On the basis of 2011 data on banks and an estimated amount of covered deposits held in banks in the euro-area, the 1% target level for the Single Resolution Fund would correspond to around EUR 55 billion. A transitional period of 10 years is foreseen before the Fund reaches its full target level. If no disbursements are made from the Fund during the initial build-up phase, the banking industry would annually contribute around one tenth of the target amount or in absolute terms around EUR 5.5 billion. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Resolution Board will be fully financed from contributions from the financial institutions. Around 6 000 Eurozone banks, in addition to their annual contributions to the Single Bank Resolution Fund, will pay a fixed pro rata of this amount to fully cover the Boards\u2019 budgetary expenses. However, there will be some minor implications on the Union\u2019s budget in the start-up phase of the Board. The incidence on the Commission\u2019s administrative expenditure is estimated at EUR 10.575 million for the period 2014-2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 establishes the Union fleet capacity policy for vessels used to carry goods on inland waterways in the Member States. In line with their fleet capacity policies, Member States with inland waterways linked to those of another Member State and total fleet tonnage of over 100 000 tonnes set up an Inland Waterway Fund (the \u2018Reserve Fund\u2019) on the basis of the aforementioned Regulation. The funds are administered by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned under their national legislation and with their own administrative resources. National organisations representing inland waterway carriers are involved in this administration. The reserve funds may be used in only two situations: In the event of a \u2018serious market disturbance\u2019 in the inland waterway transport market, as referred to in Directive 96/75/EC, the Commission may, at the request of a Member State, take suitable measures, in particular measures designed to prevent any new increase in the transport capacity on offer on the market in question. If unanimously requested by the organisations representing inland waterway transport. In such as case, any Member State may take the measures as referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. The reserve funds, consisting solely of financial contributions from the industry, have never been used. The EU-level representative organisations approached the Commission once, in 2003, to enquire about possibilities for using the funds. However, the envisaged measures were considered to be outside the scope of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. The measures referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 only cover social aspects. However, these measures could be extended in particular to broaden the scope of training schemes, to strengthen the organisation of the sector and to create a context favourable to innovation and improved environmental performance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The Commission consulted the representative organisations on 11 April 2013 on the reasons for the reserve funds never having been used, even though the sector was experiencing a decline, and on possible solutions.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2001 International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly endorsed the application of open emissions trading systems to international aviation. The Union is endeavouring to secure a future international agreement to control greenhouse gas impacts from aviation and, in the meantime, is limiting climate change impacts from aviation activities to and from aerodromes in the Union by autonomous action. In line with the outcome of the 38th ICAO Assembly held in September 2013, there should be a single global market-based measure (MBM) applying to international aviation emissions from 2020 onwards. In response to this progress and to promote further momentum towards the successful establishment of a global MBM, the Commission proposes to make amendments to the aviation activities covered by the EU ETS. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment has shown that adapting the EU ETS to accord with what was expected to be ICAO's MBM Resolution for the period up to 2020 is feasible at low administrative costs. The environmental benefit of this proposal comes from two key elements: it gives impetus to the global MBM that will cover the total emissions from international aviation from 2020 onwards. Depending on the ambition level agreed for the global MBM, total international aviation emissions will be capped at their 2020 level and even be halved by 2050 below 2005 levels; the EU ETS will continue to achieve substantial emission reductions that are expected to be up to 250 million tons CO2 in the period from 2013 to 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposed amending the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) so that aviation emissions would be covered for the part of flights that takes place in European regional airspace. The adjustment in the legislation would apply from 1 January 2014 and until a planned global market-based mechanism (MBM) becomes applicable to international aviation emissions by 2020. The key features of the revised ETS system resulting from this proposal would be as follows: flights between aerodromes in the EEA remain fully covered, as under the original Directive and Decision No. 377/2013/EU; flights to and from third countries which are not developed countries and which emit less than 1% of global aviation emissions would be exempted; fights to and from third countries are responsible for emissions taking place not beyond EEA countries, as from 2014. A simplified procedure is proposed to determine the relevant proportion of emissions of a given flight which is covered by the ETS; overflights of EEA countries are exempt, as are emissions from flights between airports in third countries and EEA airports as regards European dependencies and territories, and flights to and from EEA airports and those territories. As a simplification and to in order to lighten administrative tasks for the smallest aircraft operators, the proposal provides that action should not be taken against non-commercial aircraft operators in respect of emissions from small aircraft operators emitting less than 1000 tonnes CO2 per annum. This is expected to reduce the number of aircraft operators regulated by Member States by around 2200 representing 0.2% of emissions. All other obligations in respect of flights remain unaffected. The Commission calls for this proposal to be adopted rapidly by the European Parliament and Council, so as to provide clarity for aircraft operators, who would otherwise have to surrender allowances.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, pet dogs, cats and ferrets travelling with their owner to another Member State must be accompanied by a passport, or when imported by a certificate, providing proof of a valid anti-rabies vaccination (\u201cgeneral regime\u201d). As of 3 July 2011 electronic identification of dogs, cats and ferrets will be mandatory. In order to take account of the particular situation of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom with regard to rabies, Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides for a transitional period during which the entry of pet dogs and cats into those Member States is subjected to more stringent requirements. The Regulation grants a period of five years starting from the date of its entry into force, i.e. until 3 July 2008 (extended to 30 June 2010), to Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom to make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with certain additional requirements to prevent the risk of introducing rabies, echinococcus and ticks (\"transitional regime\"). In order to determine the regime to be applied with effect from 1 July 2010, the Commission carried out an impact assessment based on various recent consultations and on the report that was adopted on 8 October 2007 that took into account the recommendations made by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA identified that in 2005 certain Member States had a non negligible prevalence of rabies in their pet population, which is related to the rabies situation in wildlife (foxes are the main reservoir of rabies in Europe). In view of the EFSA opinions and of the Community-supported programmes, the transitional measure provided for in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should be extended until 31 December 2011. Moreover, from the opinions adopted by EFSA with regard to echinococcosis and ticks, it results that the data available did not allow EFSA to demonstrate a particular status of the five Member States applying the transitional regime with regard to certain ticks and the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis and to quantify the risk of pathogen introduction through the non-commercial movement of pet animals. For reasons of consistency, it is appropriate to extend the transitional measure provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 until 31 December 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers four policy options: Option 1 : no action - this option means that after 30 June 2010, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the UK will no longer make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to additional requirements regarding rabies, echinococcus and ticks. Option 2 : extension of the transitional regime \u2013 this option means a further temporary extension of the transitional period until the end of 2011. This option would require a Commission proposal to the European Parliament and the Council extending the transitional period for the five Member States that currently apply special rules and clarifying the regime that would apply as from 1 January 2012. Option 3 : adjustment of the current rules applicable to all Member States. Option 4 : continuation of the transitional regime on a permanent basis. Following on from the impact assessment, preference has been given to options 1 and 2, which are similar in principle. Either would entail removing, sooner or later, the unjustified disparities, discrimination and burden felt by citizens including citizens from the five Member States who are affected by additional requirements when returning from abroad. At the same time, both options would maintain a high level of safety for pet movements within and into the EU, by applying the general regime, which has proved to be effective in preventing human and pet animal cases of rabies caused by lawful movement of pets between and into Member States. However, the Commission concludes that there is a slight advantage in selecting option 2 as it lowers the public health risk. CONTENT: the overall objectives of this Regulation are to be seen in the light of the free circulation of people and the new Animal Health Strategy. The specific objectives are: to harmonise requirements to remove disproportionate obstacles to the movement of pets for non-commercial purposes across the EU or entering the EU from third countries, while properly protecting public and animal health , in particular with regard to rabies; to provide EU rules that are proportionate, avoid causing difficulties and give clear benefits in terms of clarity and simplification for travelling pet owners. The proposal foresees that special science based rules could be adopted by the Commission under the comitology procedure if a Member State demonstrates that they are necessary to effectively protect itself against the introduction and spread of disease agents that do not occur in their territory. Lastly, two new Annexes, Annex Ia and Annex Ib, the texts of which are set out in the Annex to the present Regulation, shall be inserted. Part C of Annex I, Annex Ib and parts B and C of Annex II may be amended by the Commission to take account of developments in the situation within Community territory or in third countries as regards diseases affecting the species of animals covered by this Regulation, in particular rabies.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland annexed to the Withdrawal Agreement reiterates that Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom, and that nothing in the Protocol prevents the United Kingdom from including Northern Ireland in the territorial scope of its Schedules of Concessions annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (\u2018GATT 1994\u2019). This means that despite Northern Ireland being formally in the United Kingdom\u2019s customs territory, the United Kingdom, in respect of Northern Ireland, is obliged to apply the Union\u2019s customs legislation as if Northern Ireland were still in the Union\u2019s customs territory. The bilateral arrangements between the Union and the United Kingdom under the Protocol do not give rise to rights and obligations for third countries. Consequently, any imports pursuant to Union import tariff rate quotas or other import quotas applying to goods originating in a third country brought into Northern Ireland could not be counted towards that third country\u2019s rights vis-\u00e0-vis the Union, unless agreed by the third country. That situation poses a risk to the proper functioning of the Union\u2019s Single Market and the integrity of the Common Commercial Policy through the possible circumvention of the Union\u2019s tariff rate quotas or other import quotas. To address that risk, the Union\u2019s import tariff rate quotas and other import quotas should be available only for goods imported and released into free circulation in the Union and not in Northern Ireland. Any agreement of the Union with a third country providing for export tariff rate quotas applies only to goods imported within the Union. Therefore, that third country could refuse to issue export licenses for direct imports into Northern Ireland. By virtue of the Protocol, this Regulation also applies to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland. CONTENT: under the proposed Regulation, the Union\u2019s tariff rate quotas and other import quotas on imports should be available only for goods imported from outside of the Union and released into free circulation in the Union. The proposal lists the relevant customs territories, which make up the Union customs territory. This list does not include Northern Ireland, which has the effect that the Union\u2019s tariff rate quotas and other import quotas would not be available for imports into Northern Ireland.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since early 2011, the Jordanian economy has been significantly affected by the ongoing regional unrest, notably in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Combined with a weaker global environment, this regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. The Syrian conflict has impacted Jordan not only by disrupting trade with and through Syria but also by causing an inflow of around 1.3 million of Syrian refugees into Jordan that has increased pressure on Jordan's fiscal position, public services and infrastructure. In 2012, Jordan and the IMF agreed on a first adjustment programme, which was supported by a three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 2 billion. This programme was successfully completed in August 2015. The IMF programme was complemented by a first Macro-Financial Assistance from the European Union (the EU) in the amount of EUR 180 million (MFA-I), which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in December 2013 and was disbursed in two tranches of EUR 100 million and EUR 80 million in February 2015 and in October 2015, respectively. While the country made progress with macroeconomic stabilisation and reform under the first programme supported by the IMF, the EU and other donors, the persistence of the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq continued to disrupt Jordan's foreign trade and undermine investor and tourist confidence, with the economic situation deteriorating again in 2015. In this context, the Jordanian government has called for increased support from the international community to address the economic consequences of the Syrian crisis, and in particular the presence of a large number of Syrian refugees in Jordan. At the conference 'Supporting Syria and the Region', held in London on 4 February 2016, the international community pledged about USD 10 billion to help the countries most affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. Of this amount, the EU pledged EUR 2.39 billion for the countries affected by the Syrian refugee crisis including a EUR 200 million loan for the purpose of a second Macro-Financial Assistance operation for Jordan (MFA-II). This is the aim of this proposal. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Jordan for a total maximum amount of EUR 200 million, provided in the form of a medium-term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2016-2017, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments of EUR 100 million each. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place towards the end of 2016. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the second quarter of 2017. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable? The loans shall have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Conditions granting assistance : the Union's macro-financial assistance should support Jordan's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the respect for human rights. Disbursements : the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. The Commission and the Jordanian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding aiming to improve the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth. These reform measures would support the authorities\u2019 reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF, the World Bank and other donors, as well as the policy programmes associated with the EU\u2019s budgetary support operations. They would be consistent with the economic reform priorities agreed between the EU and Jordan in the context of the Single Support Framework for 2014-2017 and other strategic documents (including the future Partnership Priorities and the Jordan Compact). They would also build upon the structural reforms implemented under MFA-I. Availability of assistance : the proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Implementing powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used in this context. Follow-up and reporting : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and would be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning of the EU's Guarantee Fund for external actions, at a rate of 9 % of the amounts disbursed, from budget line 01 03 06 (\"Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund\"). Assuming that the first loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) will be made in 2016 and the second loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) in 2017 in accordance with the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-19 budgets.

However, significant levels of savings and high levels of financial liquidity exist. The President of the European Commission in his Political Guidelines for the Commission 2014-2019 identified the Investment Plan for Europe as a key policy challenge, as did the European Council on 18 December 2014. The Plan is based on three mutually reinforcing strands: 1) the mobilisation of at least EUR 315 billion in additional investment over the next three years, maximising the impact of public resources and unlocking private investment; 2) targeted initiatives to make sure that this extra investment meets the needs of the real economy; 3) measures to provide greater regulatory predictability and to remove barriers to investment, making Europe more attractive and thereby multiplying the impact of the Plan. The European Council also invited the Union legislators to agree on the necessary legal text by June, so that the new investments could be activated as early as mid-2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes comprises the following elements : Creation of a European Fund for Strategic Investments : the Commission shall conclude an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in order to support investments in the Union and to ensure increased access to financing for companies having up to 3000 employees, with a particular focus on small and medium enterprises, through the supply of risk bearing capacity to the EIB. Participation in the EFSI should be open to third parties, including Member States, national promotional banks or public agencies owned or controlled by Member States, private sector entities and entities outside the Union subject to the consent of existing contributors. Governance of the EFSI : a Steering Board shall determine the strategic orientation, the strategic asset allocation and operating policies and procedures, including the investment policy of projects that EFSI can support and the risk profile of the EFSI; an Investment Committee, consisting of independent professionals, shall be responsible for examining potential operations and approving the support for operations irrespective of the geographic location of the project concerned. European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH) : building on existing EIB and Commission advisory services, the EIAH shall provide advisory support for investment project identification, preparation and development and act as a single technical advisory hub (including on legal issues) for project financing within the EU. Granting of an EU Guarantee and Establishment of an EU Guarantee Fund : the proposal creates an initial EU guarantee of EUR 16 billion for EIB financing and investment operations. Those operations need to support: development of infrastructure; investment in education, health, research, development, information and communications technology and innovation; expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency; or infrastructure projects in the environmental, natural resources, urban development and social fields; SMEs and mid cap companies including by providing working capital risk financing. The support can be provided directly from the EIB or through the European Investment Fund. A transparent European investment project pipeline : a stumbling block to greater investment levels within the EU is a lack of knowledge of ongoing and future investment projects within the Union. The proposal also provides for the creation of a European investment project pipeline as a means to ensure that information on potential projects is transparent and available to investors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EU guarantee provided for the EFSI amounts to EUR 16 billion. The proposal establishes a guarantee fund which is intended to provide a liquidity cushion for the Union budget against losses incurred by the EFSI in pursuit of its objectives. However, for an initial period, EUR 8bn will be provided only via payments from the budget. From 2016 onwards, these payments from the budget will gradually build up the endowment of the Fund and should reach an accumulated sum of EUR 8bn by 2020 (EUR 1.35 billion in 2015, EUR 2.03 billion in 2016, EUR 2.641 billion in 2017 and EUR 1.979 billion in 2018). However, two actions will create costs for the EIB for which the beneficiaries cannot be charged: The European Investment Advisory Hub will primarily be funded from existing envelopes for EIB technical assistance under existing EU programmes (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020\u2026). However, additional funding of up to a maximum of EUR 20 million per year (EUR 10 million in 2015) may be necessary and will be budgeted in consequence. Any potential costs for the project pipeline will also be covered; The EIB will incur administrative expenses for increasing its financing via the European Investment Fund to small and medium enterprises. This will require the payment of fees in the order of an accumulated total of EUR 105 million, around EUR 48 million of which until 2020. Operational appropriations required by this proposal are to be fully financed within the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 989EP8, ECR%:0.543, EPP%:0.851, EFD/IDG%:0.021, Greens/EFA%:0.54, NI%:0.058, REG%:0.642, S&D%:0.853, The Left%:0.019, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: First subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: a number of acts which were adopted over the last decades have exhausted all their effects, but remain technically in force. They have become obsolete because of their temporary character or because their content has been taken up by successive acts. Several measures linked to the accession of new Member States provided for transitory measures following directly the time of their accession and by now have become obsolete. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in their inter-institutional agreement on better law making that Community law should be updated and condensed by repealing acts which are no longer applied. Acts which have no continued relevance should be removed from the 'acquis communautaire', in order to improve transparency and certainty of Union law. The Commission has carried out several exercises to remove obsolete legislation from the acquis, partly trough the traditional repeal procedure, partly by declaring the relevant Commission acts obsolete. The Commission also identified a number of Council acts related to the Common Agricultural Policy, which are based upon Article 42 and 43 of the Treaty (former Articles 36 and 37) and two Acts of Accession, which have exhausted all practical effects, but are formally still in force. It is not within the Commission's powers to declare obsolete acts which were adopted by the Council.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may only adopt the act if Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) is the International Commodity Body (ICB) for cotton. Its mission is to assist governments in fostering a healthy world cotton economy. ICAC acts as a statistical observer and brings together producing, consuming, and trading countries and all segments of the cotton industry. It has an overall facilitating role. To date, the ICAC is one of the few ICBs1 where the European Union is not a member, whereas nine Member States have been members of the ICAC in their own right (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain). Membership of ICAC is in the interest of the Union, owing to the significance of cotton to the Union's economy. On various occasions (namely in its conclusions of 2004, 2008 and 2010), the Council of the European Union has requested the European Commission to consider EU membership of ICAC. It authorised the Commission in 2013 to negotiate, on behalf of the European Union and on the basis of negotiating directives, the accession of the Union to ICAC. CONTENT: with this draft decision, the Council is called upon to permit the EU to accede to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, on behalf of the Union. The Union will pay a contribution in line with the ICAC Rules and Regulations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: ICAC membership is based on the payment of an annual contribution. It is calculated on an annual basis as a function of the number of ICAC's members (fixed part) and the volume of raw cotton traded by each member (variable part). A first contribution of maximum EUR 400 000 would be required, which will give the EU an appropriate influence in ICAC affairs and allow broad EU involvement in ICAC's activities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5361EP8, ECR%:0.843, EPP%:0.914, EFD/IDG%:0.479, Greens/EFA%:1.0, NI%:0.154, REG%:0.925, S&D%:0.895, The Left%:0.808, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 on measures that the Community may take in relation to the combined effect of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard measures. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Regulation establishes specific provisions to enable the Commission, where it considers it appropriate, to take action to avoid that a combination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff measures on one and the same product could place an undesirably onerous burden on certain exporting producers seeking to export to the Union, which may have the effect of denying them access to the Union market. The Commission may consider it appropriate to: (i) amend, suspend or repeal antidumping and/or anti-subsidy measures or: (ii) provide for exemptions in whole or in part from any anti-dumping or countervailing duties which would otherwise be payable, or: (iii) adopt any other special measures.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2001, all the rules on production, marketing, distribution and use were consolidated in a veterinary medicines code (Directive 2001/82/EC); this was followed by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The current EU legislation on veterinary medicinal products provides the legal environment on authorisation, production, marketing, distribution and use of veterinary medicinal products. It brought some harmonisation to the procedures and rules required to place veterinary medicinal products on the EU market. However, the Commission considers that there is evidence that the existing provisions do not deliver a functioning internal market: diverging or incomplete transposition of the rules and the existence of numerous national requirements imply that companies are confronted with different rules and interpretation in countries and have also led to different levels of public and animal health protection; that needs of the veterinary sector differ substantially from those of the human sector in relation to medicines: in the veterinary sector there are many different animal species, which creates both a fragmented market and the need for major investments in order to extend the authorisation of medicines existing for one animal species to another; the price-setting mechanisms in the veterinary sector follow a completely different logic. Consequently, prices for veterinary medicines are typically substantially lower than for medicinal products for human use; the size of the animal pharmaceutical industry is only a small fraction of the size of the pharmaceutical industry for human medicines. The Commission considers that it is critically important to have a single market for veterinary medicinal products. The current confined and fragmented markets do not allow the pharmaceutical sector to have a positive return on investments for developing new products for certain animal species. The ambition to improve the availability of medicines in the Union and the functioning of the internal market and market competition can only be carried out at EU level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013. CONTENT: the revision of Directive 2001/82/EC and other legislation on veterinary medicinal products seek to put in place, while safeguarding public health, animal health, food safety and the environment, an up-to-date, proportionate body of legislation tailored to the specificities of the veterinary sector. Specific objectives aim to: expand the market beyond the top four animal species, simplify procedures for obtaining a marketing authorisation in multiple national markets, review data requirements in marketing authorisation procedures, simplify post authorisation requirements, review incentives for breakthrough medicines. The proposal also tackles the issue of antimicrobial resistance and introduces provisions to minimise risks to public health arising from the use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU. The additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of implementing acts.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to amend Council Directive 92/65/EEC laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC. (1) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down inter alia the animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Union of dogs, cats and ferrets. Those requirements refer to the relevant animal health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC. The repeal of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by a new Regulation on the non-commercial movement of pet animals makes it necessary to amend Directive 92/65/EEC in order to delete and replace the references to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by references to the new Regulation. (2) In addition, Directive 92/65/EEC should also be amended to take account of the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97, which applies to the transport of dogs, cats and ferrets carried out within the Union. Moreover, experience in the application of Directive 92/65/EEC has shown that operators find it difficult to comply with the requirement laid down in that Directive that a clinical examination is carried out on animals 24 hours before their dispatch. The recommendations of the World Organisation for Animal Health for imports of dogs and cats provide for a clinical examination to be carried out 48 hours before shipment of the animals. It is therefore appropriate to extend the time limit laid down in Directive 92/65/EEC to 48 hours and to amend that Directive accordingly.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may only adopt the act with Parliament\u2019s approval. BACKGROUND: the EU and Iceland are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement), which provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. Article 19 of the EEA Agreement provides that the Parties will review efforts on the further reduction of any type of barriers to trade in the agricultural sector. The previous agreement in the form of an exchange of letters entered into force on 1 January 2007. It provided for mutual tariff rate quotas and reductions in duty. It also included an undertaking by the Parties to resume bilateral negotiations under Article 19 of the EEA Agreement in two years\u2019 time. The bilateral agricultural trade agreement of 2007 increased the duty-free access of Icelandic agricultural products to the EU market to 51.9 % of trade and increased the duty-free access of EU agricultural products to the Icelandic market to 66.4 % of trade. These figures demonstrate that there was ample room for further trade concessions. Therefore, the latest round of negotiations that took place on 4 July 2012, aimed at: (i) increasing the degree of liberalisation on both sides; (ii) increasing the current tariff rate quotas; and (iii) opening new tariff rate quotas for additional agricultural products. The Agreement was initialled by the Parties on 17 September 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Iceland concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products. The Agreement provides for further trade preferences for trade in agricultural products, including additional fully liberalised tariff lines. As a result almost 90 % of EU agricultural products will enter Iceland duty-free. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy, fruit, vegetable and ornamental plants, additional tariff quotas or tariff reductions have been agreed upon. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Agreement will have no impact on the expenditure side of the EU budget. The new concessions granted on imports from Iceland will likely result in a reduction of own resources through a lower collection of customs duties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5644EP8, ECR%:0.957, EPP%:0.919, EFD/IDG%:1.0, Greens/EFA%:0.62, NI%:0.327, REG%:0.866, S&D%:0.937, The Left%:0.654, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:1, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 19 May 2010 on a Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), the Commission stressed that interoperability is essential to maximise the social and economic potential of ICT and that, consequently, the Digital Agenda can take off only if interoperability is ensured. As mentioned in its 2013 annual growth survey, the Commission considers the cross-border interoperability of online services and the digitisation of European public administrations to be important contributors to growth and increased efficiency. To enable efficient and effective interaction with citizens and businesses, Member States should modernise their administrations and provide interoperable digital services at national and European level. However, because it takes place at national level and lacks European-level interoperability, such change very often throws up electronic barriers (\u2018e-barriers\u2019) that prevent citizens and businesses from using public services efficiently and impede the smooth functioning of the internal market. Activities under the programmes put in place by the Commission since 1995 (IDA, IDABC and ISA) have contributed significantly to ensuring interoperability in the electronic exchange of information between European public administrations. In its Resolution of 20 April 2012, the European Parliament recognised the contribution and overarching role of the ISA Programme in defining, promoting and supporting the implementation of interoperability solutions and frameworks for European public administrations. It also called for an increase in the financial allocations for interoperability solutions between the EU public administrations for 2014-2020. With the ISA Programme coming to an end on 31 December 2015, a new EU programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens is needed. On 24 and 25 October 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions stressing that the modernisation of public administrations should continue, with the swift implementation of services, such as e-government, e-health, e-invoicing and e-procurement that rely on interoperability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the 2012 interim evaluation for the ISA Programme, the Commission considers that the adoption of the new programme will help reduce the cost and administrative burden of cross-border interaction for all concerned, further improve the internal market and freedom of movement in the EU without administrative e-barriers, and contribute to the swift implantation of ICT systems supporting EU legislation. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to establish, for 2016-2020, a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (\u2018the ISA2 programme\u2019). The proposed programme succeeds the ISA Programme and will consolidate, promote and expand its activities. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: improve, operate and re-use existing cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; develop, operate and re-use new cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; assess the ICT implications of proposed or adopted Union legislation and identify areas in which new legislation could promote interoperability; create a European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) to be used as the tool for building and assessing interoperability solutions; create an instrument to facilitate the re-use of existing interoperability solutions and to identify the areas in which such solutions are still missing; assess and promote existing common specifications and standards and develop new common specifications and standards; introduce a mechanism that will measure and quantify the benefits of interoperability solutions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for implementation of the new ISA2 Programme for the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 is EUR 130 928 000.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the interests of clarity and transparency of EU law, the aim of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers, which has been substantially amended several times. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed Directive incorporates into EU law the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), (STCW Convention), which was the subject of a major revision at a Conference of the Parties to the STCW Convention held in Manila in 2010. Further amendments to the Convention were adopted in 2015 and 2016. As all Member States are Parties to the STCW Convention, the harmonisation of EU regulations on the training and certification of seafarers with the STCW Convention aims to ensure consistent implementation of their international commitments. Specifically, the proposal: - sets out the training rules and standards of competence to be met by candidate seafarers in order to obtain or revalidate a certificate enabling them to perform the duties for which the certificate of competency or proficiency is issued. Training for seafarers should cover proper theoretical and practical training so as to ensure that seafarers are qualified to meet security and safety standards and are able to respond to hazards and emergencies; - obliges Member States to adopt and enforce specific measures to prevent and penalise fraudulent practices related to certificates of competency or certificates of proficiency; - lays down criteria for the inspection of maritime training establishments, training programmes and courses; - contains provisions on minimum rest periods for watchkeeping personnel to improve maritime safety and the prevention of pollution at sea; - provides for measures to ensure communication between crew members of ships sailing in EU waters; - establishes common criteria for the recognition by the Member States of seafarers\u2019 certificates issued by third countries, based on the training and certification requirements as agreed in the framework of the STCW Convention; - improves the effectiveness of the centralised mechanism for the recognition of seafarers\u2019 certificates from third countries and enhances legal clarity with regard to the mutual recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by Member States.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: energy efficiency is one of the key features of the flagship initiative \u201c A resource-efficient Europe \u201d announced in the Europe 2020 strategy. Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and fastest way to increase security of supply, and is an effective way to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions responsible for climate change. As outlined in the Commission Communication \u201c A Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 \u201d, energy efficiency can help the EU achieve and even outperform its greenhouse gas emission reduction target. The EU has set itself the objective of achieving 20% primary energy savings in 2020. The Commission\u2019s latest estimations suggest that the EU will achieve only half of the 20% target in 2020. The current framework which governs energy efficiency, in particular Directive 2006/32/EC on energy services and Directive 2004/8/EC on cogeneration, has failed to fully tap the energy saving potential. The measures already adopted at Member State level are also insufficient to overcome the remaining obstacles on markets and in regulation. The European Council and the European Parliament have called on the Commission to adopt a new ambitious strategy in the area of energy efficiency for determined action to tap the considerable potential. To give fresh momentum to energy efficiency, on 8 March 2011 the Commission put forward a new Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) setting out measures to achieve further savings in energy supply and use. This legislative proposal transforms certain aspects of the EEP into binding measures. It also looks beyond the 20% target and seeks to set a common framework to promote energy efficiency in the Union beyond 2020. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment explores a series of options broken down into three levels: First-level policy options analyse ways to improve the current policy framework. This analysis focuses primarily on issues of whether the current approach of the ESD to target setting should be extended until 2020, whether national energy savings targets should be added to achieve the EU 20 % target and if so, whether they should be binding or merely indicative. The analysis concludes that the ESD targets should be maintained for end-use sectors until their deadline in 2016, but to reach the 20 % energy efficiency target they need to be complemented with more ambitious energy savings targets under the Europe 2020 process. Second-level policy options explore different measures to tackle the remaining economic potential on the demand and supply side. The IA looks at energy savings obligation schemes as a possible option for yielding energy savings in end-use sectors. Another set of policy options examine measures involving the public sector. Other options with a considerable positive impact compared to their costs are those that aim to promote the energy services market, provide improved and more frequent information to households and companies on their actual energy consumption through billing and smart meters, and mandatory energy audits for large companies. Other options to promote energy efficiency via voluntary measures are assessed as insufficient to tap all the available potential for savings. The IA also analyses which measures could help tap energy efficiency potential in energy transformation and distribution, as well as options for national reporting and monitoring of implementation. Third-level policy options assess the legal form of the selected first- and second-level measures. It concludes that, in order to reach the level of ambition of the EU 20% energy efficiency target, EU policies need to reap the energy saving potential in every sector, including in those sectors excluded from the scope of the ESD. This is why it is proposed to adopt a new legislative proposal that covers the scope of the two Directives and extends it to all sectors with energy saving potential. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive establishes a common framework for promoting energy efficiency in the Union to ensure the target of 20 % primary energy savings by 2020 is met and to pave the way for further energy efficiency afterwards. It lays down rules designed to remove barriers and overcome some of the market failures that impede efficiency in the supply and use of energy. End-use sectors : the proposed Directive focuses on measures that lay down requirements on the public sector, both as regards renovating the buildings it owns and applying high energy efficiency standards to the purchase of buildings, products and services. requires Member States to establish national energy efficiency obligation schemes; requires regular mandatory energy audits for large companies and lays down a series of requirements on energy companies regarding metering and billing. Energy supply sector : the proposal requires Member States: to adopt national heating and cooling plans to develop the potential for high-efficiency generation and efficient district heating and cooling, and to ensure that spatial planning regulations are in line with these plans; to adopt authorisation criteria that ensure that installations are located in sites close to heat demand points and that all new electricity generation installations and existing installations that are substantially refurbished are equipped with high-efficiency CHP units. Member States should however be able to lay down conditions for exemption from this obligation where certain conditions are met; to establish an inventory of energy efficiency data for installations undertaking the combustion of fuels or the refining of mineral oil and gas. The proposal also sets requirements on priority/guaranteed access to the grid, priority dispatch of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration and the connection of new industrial plants producing waste heat to district or cooling networks. Other measures proposed include efficiency requirements for national energy regulatory authorities, information and awareness-raising actions, requirements concerning the availability of certification schemes, action to promote the development of energy services, and an obligation for Member States to remove obstacles to energy efficiency, notably the split of incentives between the owner and tenant of a building or among building owners. Lastly, the proposal provides for the establishment of national energy efficiency targets for 2020 and requires the Commission to assess in 2014 whether the Union can achieve its target of 20% primary energy savings by 2020. The Commission is required to submit its assessment to the European Parliament and the Council, followed, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal laying down mandatory national targets. It should be noted that the scope of two Directives: the Cogeneration Directive (2004/8/EC, CHP Directive) and the Energy Services Directive (2006/32/EC, ESD) overlap with this proposal. It is therefore proposed that these two Directives are repealed when the new Directive enters into force, except for Articles 4(1) to (4) and Annexes I, III and IV to the ESD. These provisions concern the achievement by 2017 of an indicative energy saving target of 9% of the final energy consumption of each Member State in the 5 years before the implementation of the ESD. This target \u2013 albeit different in scope and level of ambition - contributes to the realisation of the EU's 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, and should therefore remain applicable until 2017. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Directive will be implemented using the existing budget and will not have an impact on the multi-annual financial framework.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: total freight transport in the EU has increased by almost 25 % over the last 20 years, and is projected to further increase by 51 % during 2015-2050. All this movement of goods is accompanied by a large amount of information being exchanged among a variety of parties, in both the private and the public domain. Today, this information is mostly printed on paper, in a variety of standard format documents. The fragmented legislation and the resulting lack of acceptance by authorities discourage investment in digital solutions for electronic documents. Yet the digitalisation of information exchange has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of transport and therefore to contribute to the smooth functioning of the single market. The Commission has acknowledged the need to foster acceptance and use of electronic transport documents in a number of policy initiative. The case for intervention has also been recognised by a wide range of stakeholders. This initiative is part of the third \u2018Europe on the Move\u2019 Package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017, and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a full obligation for Member State authorities to accept regulatory cargo transport information or documentation, with partially harmonised implementation. The main expected benefits are of an economic and environmental nature. The industry is expected to make savings worth EUR 20-27 billion over 2018-2040, compared to a scenario where no policy intervention at EU level is made (the baseline), thanks to reduction in administrative costs (i.e. costs related to the management and exchange of transport information and documentation). This is equivalent to 75-102 million hours saved yearly. Road transport operators, 99% of which are SMEs, are expected to benefit of about 60% of all industry administrative costs savings. Positive environmental impacts are also expected, due to a decrease in road transport\u2019s modal share in 2030 relative to the baseline. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation contains measures to: ensure that the obligation for all competent public authorities to accept electronic freight documents/information is in place in all EU Member States; ensure that the authorities implement the obligation of acceptance in a uniform manner; ensure the interoperability of the IT systems and solutions used for the electronic exchange of freight transport information, and in particular for business-to-administration (B2A) regulatory information communication. Concretely, the proposal: lays down requirements relative to the electronic format in which regulatory transport information (eFTI) should be made available by the economic operators concerned; establishes the obligation of the Member States\u2019 competent authorities of regulatory information made available electronically by the economic operators concerned in compliance with the conditions provided that such information meets the requirements guaranteeing its authenticity, integrity, security, etc; requires the competent authorities, eFTI services providers and economic operators concerned to take measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information processed and exchanged in accordance with this Regulation; establishes the obligation of the Commission to adopt implementing acts establishing a common data set and subsets in relation the regulatory requirements under the scope of this Regulation, and laying down common procedures and rules for access to and processing by the competent authorities of regulatory information provided electronically; sets out the functional requirements for the eFTI platforms by the means of which the regulatory information could be made available by the economic operators concerned, and empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts laying detailed rules for their implementation.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/28/EC (the \"Renewable Energy Directive\") established mandatory targets of 20% overall share of renewable energy in the EU by 2020 and a 10% share for renewable energy in the transport sector. At the same time, an amendment to Directive 98/70/EC (\"the Fuel Quality Directive\") introduced a mandatory target of a 6% reduction by 2020 in the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used in road transport and non-road mobile machinery. The contribution of biofuels towards these targets is expected to be significant. Whilst both Directives include sustainability criteria including minimum greenhouse gas saving thresholds, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with changes in the carbon stock of land resulting from indirect changes in land use (ILUC) are not subject to reporting requirements under the current legislation. The Commission was invited to review the impact of indirect land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions and, if appropriate, propose ways to minimise it whilst respecting existing investments made in biofuels production. The Commission Communication of 2010 identified a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the available numerical models used to quantify indirect land-use change, whilst acknowledging that indirect land-use change can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions savings associated with biofuels and bioliquids, and as such, recommended that this issue was to be addressed under a precautionary approach. Scientific work indicates that emissions from indirect land-use change can vary substantially between feedstocks and can negate some or all of the greenhouse gas savings of individual biofuels relative to the fossil fuels they replace. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to amend the existing legislation with a view to limiting the contribution that conventional biofuels (with a risk of ILUC emissions) make towards attainment of the targets in the Renewable Energy Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this Commission proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: in order to ensure an increased use of sustainable biofuels to meet the necessary targets, the Commission is proposing to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive. 1. Introduction of limits on the contribution that conventional biofuels and bioliquids produced from food crops, such as those based on cereals and other starch rich crops, sugars and oil crops, to the Renewable Energy Directive targets to current consumption levels, without foreseeing any limits on their overall consumption. The Commission is proposing to limit to the current level of consumption, i.e. 5%, the volume of biofuels and bioliquids produced from crops used for food and feed that can be included in the EU\u2019s 10% target for renewable energy target for 2020 for the transport sector, while maintaining the overall renewable energy and carbon intensity reduction targets. 2. An increase to 60% of the minimum greenhouse gas saving threshold for biofuels and bioliquids produced in new installations, with effect from 1st July 201,4 in order to improve the EU\u2019s overall greenhouse gas balance, as well as discouraging further investments in installations with low greenhouse gas savings performance. 3. The introduction of the reporting of estimated emissions from carbon stock changes caused by indirect land-use change, based on the best available scientific evidence, for the purposes of the calculation of the life cycle greenhouse gas emission savings from biofuels and bioliquids, in the reports required to be provided by fuel suppliers and the Member States on greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels and bioliquids. 4. A strengthened incentive mechanism to further promote sustainable and advanced biofuels from feedstocks that do not create an additional demand for land. 5. The simplification of the calculation of greenhouse gas savings for European biofuel producers, levelling the playing field between EU producers and producers in third countries. The proposal also seeks to protect existing investments until 2020. The Commission is of the view that, in the period after 2020, biofuels which do not lead to substantial greenhouse gas savings (when emissions from indirect land-use change are included) and are produced from crops used for food and feed should not be subsidised.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement represented a significant change in transatlantic aviation relations, providing broad new commercial freedoms for airlines and a comprehensive framework for regulatory cooperation with the United States on a wide range of issues. The 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement created substantial benefits for airlines, airports and air transport users in Europe. However, the EU was seeking additional investment and market access opportunities. Therefore, Article 21 of the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement established a non-exhaustive list of 'items of priority interest' for the second stage negotiations, including additional investment and market access opportunities, as well as environmental issues. After eight rounds of second stage negotiations, agreement was reached on 25 March 2010 on a draft Protocol to Amend the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement. The Protocol aims at: launching a process towards additional foreign investment opportunities in the airline industry, further opening market access, including further access by EU airlines to US Government-financed air transportation, and further strengthening the regulatory cooperation in all fields of aviation policy, particularly on addressing the environmental impact of aviation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Protocol further increases the benefits for consumers, airlines, labour, and communities in the Union: (1) in a study carried out for the Commission, the economic benefits of a fully Open Aviation Area between the EU and the United States have been estimated at several billion Euros per year; (2) another study estimates that further regulatory convergence in the field of air transport could significantly reduce costs for the industry. The same study concluded that the second stage negotiations have the potential to change the structure of the market in the EU and in the US, increasing profitability in the airline industry; (3) the inclusion of an article on the social dimension ensures that the further market opening will be accompanied by high labour standards and that labour-related rights will not be undermined by the new opportunities created by the Protocol; (4) lastly, the Protocol includes firm commitments from both Parties to limit or reduce the impact of international aviation on the environment. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2) and (5), as well Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reasons: (i) an amendment of an international treaty at Union level can only be done at Union level; (ii) the objectives of the Protocol can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. CONTENT: the Protocol amends the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement with the following provisions: a legal obligation to reciprocally recognise the regulatory determinations of the other Party with regard to airline fitness and citizenship; an enhanced cooperation to limit the impact of international aviation on the environment. The cooperation on addressing the environmental impacts of international aviation will include the areas of research and development, air traffic management innovation, coordination in international fora; an explicit recognition of the importance of the social dimension and the benefits of high labour standards as well as an enhanced cooperation on the social effects of the agreement; a strengthened role of the Joint Committee, enabling it to address incompatible regulatory approaches, allow for reciprocal recognition of decision-making, and promote cooperation across a number of additional fields, including air traffic management, facilitation, safety and cooperation with other countries; a process towards further market access and investment opportunities. Both sides commit to continuing to remove market access barriers. The Joint Committee will regularly review progress in that respect. Both sides will establish a process of cooperation in the Joint Committee towards the shared goal of removing market access barriers; further access of EU airlines to air transport funded by the US Government that is restricted currently to US airlines (\"Fly America\"). EU airlines will be able to sell air transportation to contractors of the US Government on any route, with exception of transport financed by the US Department of Defence. The Protocol is accompanied by a Memorandum of Consultations that includes additional new elements, in order to further enhance the existing cooperation in the areas of aviation security, competition policy, and the joint efforts to address the environmental impact of international aviation.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the challenges that need to be tackled by external action have increased in recent years: regional conflicts, terrorism, economic inequalities and growing migratory pressures, demographic growth and environmental degradation. At the same time, while poverty levels have declined globally, the number of people living in poverty continues to be a major problem, including in emerging economies. For the next long-term EU budget for the period 2021-2027, the European Commission proposes to increase investment in external actions, to restructure the Union's external action instruments and to integrate the European Development Fund (EDF) into the EU budget in order to ensure greater coherence, to benefit from effective cooperation, to simplify procedures and to achieve economies of scale. The proposed neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument (NDICI) is designed to uphold and promote the Union\u2019s values and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of its external action. It shall be the EU's main instrument for assisting its partners in their political and economic change towards sustainable development, stability, consolidation of democracy, socio-economic development and poverty eradication. The proposal provides a framework for the implementation of external action policies and international obligations that include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and UN Security Council Resolution 2282 (2016) on sustaining peace. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument programme for the period 2021-2027. It also establishes the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (the EFSD+) and an external action guarantee. The neighbourhood and international cooperation instrument shall be based on three pillars: a geographical pillar to cover planned cooperation with neighbouring countries and all other third countries. This component shall bring together geographical programmes for the European Neighbourhood, for sub-Saharan Africa, for Asia and the Pacific, and for the Americas and the Caribbean to jointly address global challenges such as human development, including gender equality, climate change; a thematic pillar (achieving common goals), which addresses global issues and/or policy flagship initiatives through specific programmes focusing on human rights and democracy, civil society organisations, stability and peace. a \u2018rapid response\u2019 pillar which is dedicated to quick response capacity for crisis management and conflict prevention, as well as strengthening the resilience of states, societies, communities and individuals, the link between humanitarian aid and development actions, and early action to meet other foreign policy objectives. Flexibility reserve : building on the successful experience of the European Development Fund (EDF), an amount should remain unallocated as an emerging challenges and priorities cushion. The cushion shall be used primarily to address migration pressures, but also stability and security needs, unforeseen events and new international initiatives and priorities. New European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) : the EFSD+ shall be an integrated financial mechanism providing financing capacity worldwide in the form of grants, budget guarantees and financial instruments. The EDFD+ shall support the external investment plan and combine blending and budget guarantee operations covered by the external action guarantee, including those covering sovereign risks associated with lending operations previously carried out under the external lending mandate to the European Investment Bank. General principles : the following principles shall apply to the instrument as a whole: democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, rights-based approach, cooperation, dialogue, partnership, development effectiveness, consideration of climate change, environmental protection and gender equality. The proposal also provides for an obligation to inform the European Parliament and to exchange information regularly with it. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the instrument for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 89.2 billion in current prices. EUR 7 billion for thematic programmes : (i) EUR 1.5 billion for human rights and democracy; (ii) EUR 1.5 billion for civil society organisations; (iii) EUR 1 billion for stability and peace; (iv) EUR 3 billion for global challenges; The cushion for emerging challenges and priorities amounting to EUR 10.2 billion may also be used."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 9914EP8, ECR%:0.571, EPP%:0.633, EFD/IDG%:0.271, Greens/EFA%:0.0, NI%:0.038, REG%:0.94, S&D%:0.848, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 8 July 2019, the Council adopted the mandate authorising the European Commission to open negotiations for the renewal of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement, which expires on 15 November 2019. On 8 November 2019, the Protocol was extended for a period of one year by an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters, until 15 November 2020 by means of Council Decision (EU) 2020/742. Due to the current health context (COVID -19 pandemic) the ongoing negotiations for the renewal of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol will not be concluded in time to avoid a disruption of fishing activities at the end of this extension. In this context, on 26 June 20203 the Council therefore authorised the Commission to negotiate a further extension to the Protocol for a maximum duration of one more year. CONTENT: in order to prevent an interruption of fishing activity for the European fleet operating in Mauritanian waters, the Council Decision endorsing this agreement in the form of an exchange of letters must be adopted in due time to allow for signature by both Parties before 15 November 2020, when the current Protocol expires. The aim of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters is to enable the European Union and Mauritania to continue working together to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and a sound exploitation of fishery resources in Mauritanian waters and to allow EU vessels to fish in those waters. Fishing opportunities The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 25 vessels; -Black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers targeting black hake: 3 500 tonnes of hake, 1 450 tonnes of squid, 600 tonnes of cuttlefish for 6 vessels; - Vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Tuna seiners: 12 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 25 vessels; - Pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners: 7 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers: 225 000 tonnes and 19 vessels; - Non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from volume under category 6 if used) and 2 vessels. Financial contribution The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 61 625 000, based on: (a) an annual amount for access to fishery resources for the categories provided for in the Protocol, set at EUR 57 500 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol; (b) support for the development of Mauritania\u2019s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 4 125 000 per year for the duration of the extension to the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of Mauritania\u2019s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) is the only legally binding multilateral agreement in the field of personal data protection. Convention 108 requires the Parties to incorporate into their respective national laws the necessary measures to ensure respect for the human right of all individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. At present, 51 States have ratified Convention 108, including all 28 EU Member States. Convention 108 was opened for signature in 1981, long before the era of the internet and electronic communications. The development of technology and globalisation of information poses new challenges in the field of protection of personal information. On 31 May 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to participate on behalf of the Union in the negotiations on the modernisation of the Council of Europe Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data (EST 108) and the conditions and modalities of accession of the Union to the modernised Convention. The Protocol amending Convention 108 (the amending Protocol) was adopted by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 18 May 2018 and will be open for signature as of 25 June 2018. The amending Protocol aims to widen the scope, increase the level and improve the effectiveness of data protection afforded under Convention 108.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the collection of data by type of goods is mandatory for road (Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/98), rail (Regulation (EC) No 91/2003), and inland waterways (Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006) transport European statistics. European statistics on all modes of transport should be collected according to common concepts and standards, with the aim of achieving the fullest practicable comparability between transport modes. More particularly, the provision of comprehensive and homogeneous statistics by type of goods for all the modes of transport will provide a general framework for monitoring policies for promoting co-modality, i.e. the possibility of combining various modes of transport within the same transport chain in the best way, and the modernisation of freight transport logistics. More generally, the proposed amendment, in combination with other initiatives, will adapt the statistical output to current and foreseeable users' needs. Under current legislation, (Directive 2009/42/EC, Annex VIII, data set B1), data are collected on a voluntary basis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: two options were considered: Option 1 : the current legislation is maintained Option 2 : the current legislation is amended. The second option was selected, in order secure a complete and continuous provision of statistical data on maritime transport by type of goods. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of this proposal, namely the establishment of a common framework for the systematic production of European statistics on seaborne goods using the same classification by type of goods as for the other relevant transport statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States via a voluntary collection. They can be achieved more readily at European level since only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at European level, whereas the collection of data and compilation of comparable statistics on maritime transport can be organised by Member States. CONTENT: the objective of the Regulation is to ensure a complete and continuous provision of statistical data on maritime transport by type of goods, consistent and harmonised with the statistics already available for the other relevant modes of transport. According to the second paragraph of Annex VIII of Directive 2009/42/EC, the conditions for collecting data set B1 (data concerning \"Seaborne transport in the main European ports, by port, type of cargo, goods and relation\") shall be decided by the Council in the light of the results of the pilot study carried out during a three-year transitional period, as provided for in Directive 95/64/EC. Subsequently, the Commission reported that the collection of detailed information appeared feasible and at reasonable cost for bulk and semi-bulk cargo. Remaining difficulties have been solved since more experience has been gained with collecting the current variables and by the introduction of the NST 2007 (Standard Goods Classification for Transport Statistics, 2007) as the unique classification for transported goods in maritime, road, rail and inland waterways transport, applicable from the reference year 2008, covering the 2008 data. The proposal states that the first reference year for the obligation to provide data set B1 will be 2011, covering the 2011 data. Accordingly, the second paragraph of Annex VIII to Directive 2009/42/EC is deleted.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning of each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation. Article 25 of this regulation determines that the total amount of the reserve for crises in agricultural sector shall be EUR 2 800 million with equal annual instalments of EUR 400 million (at 2011 prices) for the period 2014-2020 and shall be included under Heading 2 of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget.

Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure, the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely to be exceeded. Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is only to apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the corresponding calendar year. Furthermore, it provides that as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustment rate is only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia from 1 January 2022. The Commission has to present a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate no later than 31 March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustment rate applies. CONTENT: this proposal aims to implement the provisions of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. It seeks to set the percentage rate of the financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015. The proposed Regulation lays down the amounts of direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be reduced by 1.393041%. The reduction shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 913EP8, ECR%:0.5, EPP%:0.824, EFD/IDG%:0.312, Greens/EFA%:0.82, NI%:0.154, REG%:0.821, S&D%:0.859, The Left%:0.846, General Majority:0, Left Majority:1, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Liberia with a view to concluding a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and an Implementation Protocol thereto between the European Union and Liberia. Following these negotiations, a new Agreement and Protocol were initialled on 5 June 2015. It is now appropriate to conclude that Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the draft decision calls on the Council to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia and the Implementation Protocol. Objectives: the new Agreement will provide for a framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and Liberia. The main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Liberian fishing zone, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and respecting the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), where applicable within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Liberia to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Liberia\u2019s fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the recommendations presented in February 2009 of a group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009 (COM(2009)0114). The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 (COM(2009)0252) which proposed the establishment of : a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees into a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), thereby combining the advantages of an overarching European framework for financial supervision with the expertise of local micro-prudential supervisory bodies that are closest to the institutions operating in their jurisdictions; and a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. To this end, the ESRB would provide an early warning of system-wide risks that may be building up and, where necessary, issue recommendations for action to deal with these risks. The European Council, in its conclusions of 19 June 2009, recommended that a European System of Financial Supervisors, comprising three new European Supervisory Authorities, be established. The system should be aimed at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision, strengthening oversight of cross border groups and establishing a European single rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to proposals on: \u00b7 a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), \u00b7 a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), \u00b7 a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanies these proposals, examining the options in more detail (see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: in order to take account of sectoral specificities, three separate Regulations are needed to establish the Authorities for banking, insurance and occupational pensions, and securities. The broad thrust of these proposals is, however, identical. The proposal discusses the common elements and briefly touches upon the differences between the three Regulations. Objectives of the ESAs : these shall be to contribute to: (i) improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular a high, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision, (ii) protecting depositors, investors, policyholders and other beneficiaries, (iii) ensuring the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, (iv) safeguarding the stability of the financial system, and (v) strengthening international supervisory coordination. The ESAs will be Community bodies with a legal personality and a key element of the proposed ESFS. The latter shall function as a network of supervisors and comprise the national authorities in the Member States, a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities, to cover cross-sectoral issues, and the European Commission. While the ESAs should enjoy maximum independence to objectively fulfil their mission, the Commission has to be involved where institutional reasons and the responsibilities under the Treaty so require. The main decision-making body of each ESA will be its Board of Supervisors, consisting of the heads of the relevant national supervisors as well as the Chairperson of the respective Authority. The Chairperson will preside over meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Management Board. The day-to-day management of each Authority will be in the hands of an Executive Director. Tasks and powers : the ESAs will take on all the tasks of the existing European supervisory committees, but also have significantly increased responsibilities, defined legal powers and greater authority. Develop technical standards : a single EU rule book should be established, applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. To this end, differences in the national transposition of Community law stemming from exceptions, derogations, additions or ambiguities must be removed, so that one harmonised core set of standards can be defined and applied. To contribute to this, the Authorities will develop draft technical standards. These standards constitute an effective instrument to strengthen Level 3 of the Lamfalussy structure, which currently is limited to the adoption of non-binding guidelines. Powers to ensure the consistent application of Community rules : a mechanism will be put in place to address behaviour by national supervisory authorities who are considered to be diverging from the existing Community legislation (including technical standards). The proposal describes the steps of the mechanism. Action in emergency situations : whilst ESAs will have a coordination role between national supervisory authorities, in some emergency situations coordination may not be sufficient, notably when national supervisors alone lack the tools to respond rapidly to an emerging cross-border crisis. The ESAs should thereforehave the power to require national supervisors to take specific action jointly. The determination of a cross-border emergency situation will be left to the Commission. This is subject to the safeguard clause. Settlement of disagreements between national supervisory authorities : a mechanism is proposed to ensure that relevant national supervisory authorities take due account of the interests of other Member States, including within colleges of supervisors. This mechanism consists of three possible steps which are set out in the text. Colleges of supervisors : the latter are central to the EU supervisory system and play an important role in ensuring a balanced flow of information between home and host authorities. The ESAs will contribute to promoting the efficient and consistent functioning of colleges of supervisors and may participate as observers in colleges of supervisors and receive all relevant information shared between the members of the college. Common supervisory culture: the ESAs shall play an active role in building a common European supervisory culture and ensuring uniform procedures and consistent supervisory practices throughout the Community. The common supervisory culture may increasingly create opportunities for supervisors to delegate certain tasks to one another. The ESAs shall periodically conduct peer review analysis of national supervisory authorities. Assessment of market developments : although the proposed ESRB will be responsible for macro-prudential analysis of the EU financial sector, the ESAs should continue the work of the existing European supervisory committees in this area as: (i) the focus of their analysis is different, i.e., micro-prudential analysis provides a bottom-up analysis, rather than macro-prudential analysis which is top-down, and (ii) their analysis may serve as helpful input into the work carried-out by the ESRB. International role : through these proposals the Commission is responding to the weaknesses identified during the crisis as well as to the G20 call to take action to build a stronger, more globally consistent, regulatory and supervisory system for financial services. The ESAs could serve as helpful contact points for supervisory authorities from third countries. They may enter into administrative arrangements with administrations of third countries and may also assist in preparing equivalence decisions pertaining to supervisory regimes in third countries. They may provide advice to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission or publish opinions, including with respect to the prudential assessments of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Collection of information : at the request of the Authority, supervisory authorities and other public authorities of the Member States shall provide the Authority with all the necessary information to carry out the duties assigned to it by this Regulation. In principle, all information should be transferred to the ESAs by the national supervisory authorities. Relationship with the ESRB: the framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate closely. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB would need a timely flow of micro-prudential information, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities would benefit from the ESRB\u2019s insights on the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more national supervisory authorities. Safeguard: in view of the fact that decisions by the ESAs should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States, a safeguard clause is introduced which ensures that, where a Member State considers that a decision taken under provisions concerning emergency decisions or settlement of disagreements of these Regulations impinges on its fiscal responsibility, it may notify the Authority and the Commission that the national supervisory authority does not intend to implement the Authority's decision, clearly demonstrating how the decision by the Authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities. Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities : a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities will ensure mutual understanding, cooperation and consistent supervisory approaches between the three new ESAs. Board of Appeal : an appeal system will ensure that any person, including national supervisory authorities, may in first instance appeal to a Board of Appeal against a decision by the ESAs to ensure the coherent application of Community rules, action in emergency situations, and the settlement of disagreements. The Board of Appeal shall be a joint body of three ESAs, i.e., it will deal with issues related to banking, insurance and securities. Key differences between the three Regulations : the main differences between the three proposed Regulations concern the objectives of the Authorities, the scope of action, and the definitions, which are adapted to the specificities of the relevant sector and existing Community legislation. Moreover, the European Council concluded that the ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. ESMA would be responsible to register credit rating agencies. ESMA would also be empowered to take supervisory measures such as withdrawing the registration or suspending the use for regulatory purposes of credit ratings. Supervisory powers could include the power to request information and to conduct investigations or on-site inspections. The responsibilities and powers of ESMA with regard to credit rating agencies will be defined in an amendment to the Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: for the transformation of the existing European supervisory committees into effective ESAs, enhanced resources are needed - both personnel and budgetary. For the EBA, the total operational expenditure from the Community budget in commitment and payment appropriations for the years 2011-2013 is EUR 21.527 million. In addition, Member States (national supervisory authorities or ministries of finance) will contribute EUR 32.290 million over the three year period. This gives a total of EUR 53.816 million from 2011 to 2013."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 936EP7, ECR%:0.632, EPP%:0.89, EFD/IDG%:0.29, Greens/EFA%:0.86, NI%:0.273, REG%:0.892, S&D%:0.851, The Left%:0.029, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

BACKGROUND: on the basis of negotiating directives adopted by the Council, the Commission has negotiated the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with a view to establishing a state of the art and privileged economic relationship with Canada. Canada is a strategic partner of the European Union and they have reached an ambitious agreement which will open up new opportunities for trade and investment for economic actors on both sides of the Atlantic. Both sides have also underlined through this agreement the importance of economic activity taking place within a framework of clear and transparent regulation defined by public authorities, and that they consider the right to regulate in the public interest as a basic underlying principle of the Agreement. The CETA negotiations were completed and initialled at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 1 August 2014. It is now necessary to conclude this comprehensive agreement on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt a Decision to conclude the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part. Aim of the Agreement: the CETA is a comprehensive trade and investment agreement which contains provisions on: Specific trade aim: CETA will significantly improve business opportunities for European companies in Canada. With CETA, European companies will receive the best treatment that Canada has ever offered to any trading partner, thus levelling the playing field on the Canadian market for EU companies. By opening markets, CETA should support growth and jobs in the EU and bring further benefits for European consumers. It has the potential to keep prices down and provide consumers with greater choice of quality products. CETA will not change EU standards. Standards and regulations related to food safety, product safety, consumer protection, health, environment, social or labour standards etc. will remain untouched. All imports from Canada will have to satisfy all EU product rules and regulations \u2013 without exception. Institutional component of the Agreement: the Agreement establishes a CETA Joint Committee that will continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of this agreement. The CETA Joint Committee is comprised of representatives of the European Union and representatives of Canada who will meet once a year or at the request of a Party and will supervise the work of all specialised committees and other bodies established under this Agreement. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the CETA will be the first to incorporate the new Investment Court System (ICS) in the context of the Investment Dispute Resolution System. Accordingly, an amount of EUR 500 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2017 onwards (subject to ratification) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU\u2019s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States \u2013 seeks to establish the rights and values programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the justice programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The general objective of the proposed rights and values programme is to protect and promote rights and values as enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by supporting civil society organisations, in order to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies. The programme has three specific objectives: (1) Promotion of equality and rights (equality and rights strand) : preventing and combating inequalities and discrimination on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and supporting comprehensive policies to promote gender equality and anti-discrimination and their mainstreaming as well policies to combat racism and all forms of intolerance; protecting and promoting the rights of the child, the rights of people with disabilities, Union citizenship rights and the right to the protection of personal data. (2) Promoting citizens' engagement and participation in the democratic life of the Union (citizens\u2019s engagement and participation strand) : increasing citizens\u2019 understanding of the Union, its history, cultural heritage and diversity; promoting exchange and cooperation between citizens of different countries and citizens\u2019 civic and democratic participation. (3) Combating violence (Daphne strand) : preventing and combating all forms of violence against children, young people and women and violence against other groups at risk; and supporting and protecting the victims of such violence. The programme shall provide for and accelerate the synergies between its different specific objectives in order to increase their potential to reach citizens. To be effective, the programme shall take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. Proposed budget : the programme\u2019s overall budget is set at EUR 641.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount shall be allocated as follows: EUR 408.7 million for the \u2018equality and rights\u2019 and \u2018fight against violence\u2019 strands; EUR 233 million for the citizen engagement and participation strand."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 8968EP8, ECR%:0.014, EPP%:0.661, EFD/IDG%:0.0, Greens/EFA%:0.9, NI%:0.038, REG%:0.851, S&D%:0.843, The Left%:0.269, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: over the past 50 years organ transplantation has become an established worldwide practice, bringing immense benefits to hundreds of thousands of patients. Organ transplantation is now the most cost-effective treatment for end-stage renal failure, while for end-stage failure of organs such as the liver, lung and heart it is the only available treatment. The shortage of organs is a major factor affecting transplantation programmes. Nearly 56 000 patients are now on waiting lists in the EU. Mortality rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15 to 30%. Donation rates and availability of organs varies considerably across Europe with achievable good practice delivering far greater benefits in some Member States than in others. On 31 May 2007, the Commission adopted a Communication on organ donation and transplantation based on that analysis. This Communication proposes what activities the EU should undertake in the field of organ transplantation. In December 2007, the Council adopted conclusions on organ donation and transplantation which recognised the importance of having high standards with respect to the quality and safety of organs for transplantation, so as to ensure a high level of protection for patients throughout Europe. The Council called on the Commission to consult the Member States, and continue its examination of the need for an EU framework on quality and safety for human organs. The European Parliament resolution adopted on 22 April 2008 recognised that it is vitally important to improve the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation to reduce transplant risks. It invited the Commission to present a proposal for a directive stipulating requirements to ensure the quality and safety of organ donation across the EU. CONTENT: this proposal for a Directive covers human organs, that are used for transplantation, during all the phases of the process \u2013 donation, procurement, testing, preservation, transport and use \u2013 and aims to ensure their quality and safety and hence a high level of health protection. Organs that are transplanted into the human body in clinical trials should comply with the quality and safety standards laid down in this Directive. The added value of the Directive: Ensuring quality and safety for patients at EU level : this Directive sets out the basic quality and safety requirements needed in every transplant system. More specifically, the proposal: provides for the creation or designation of a competent national authority in each Member State which will ensure compliance with the requirements of the Directive; establishes a system for the authorisation of programmes of organ procurement and transplantation based on common quality and safety criteria. This system would provide a complete list of authorised centres throughout the European Union, accessible to the public and professionals alike; establishes common quality and safety standards for the processes of evaluating donors and human organs, thus ensuring the health of recipients; proposes the introduction of national quality programmes to ensure continuous monitoring of performance and improvement and learning; ensures that Member States put in place organ traceability systems. The Commission will adopt procedures for guaranteeing full traceability of organs exchanged between Member States; includes measures to capture serious adverse events related to the procurement, testing and transport of organs, as well as any serious adverse reactions observed during or after transplantation which may be connected to the procurement, testing and transport of the organ in the European Union. The Commission will adopt procedures for ensuring interoperability between the reporting systems on adverse events and reactions. Ensuring the protection of donors : the proposed Directive contains a number of measures to protect living donors. These include correct evaluation of the health of the donor and comprehensive information about the risks prior to donation, the introduction of registers for living donors to follow up their health and measures to ensure the altruistic and voluntary donation of organs by living donors. Facilitating cooperation between Member States and cross-border exchanges : the Directive will: i) put in place the quality and safety conditions needed to facilitate cross-border exchanges; ii) standardise the collection of the relevant information on the characteristics of the organ needed to make a proper risk assessment; iii) establish a mechanism for transmission of the information; iv) provide for the necessary mechanisms to be put in place for cross-border exchanges of organs to ensure traceability of the organ and pre-empt serious adverse reporting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 643EP7, ECR%:0.772, EPP%:0.883, EFD/IDG%:0.613, Greens/EFA%:0.877, NI%:0.455, REG%:0.94, S&D%:0.867, The Left%:0.771, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Tripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment (TSS) was set up by Council Decision 2003/174/EC, which formalised the practice of holding highlevel, informal meetings since 1997 in the framework of the European Employment Strategy, and subsequently the Lisbon Strategy. This Decision was proposed to institutionalise the practice of high-level consultation between the EU institutions and the EU social partners. The proposal meant abolishing the former Standing Committee on Employment, which was set up in 1970 and reformed in 1999. Since 2003, the TSS has been a separate event from the European Council meetings and has broadly fulfilled its aim of facilitating the exchange of views at the highest level between the Commission, the EU Presidency and the EU social partners on employment and social aspects of the Lisbon Strategy (since 2010, and then of the Europe 2020 Strategy). Until the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the meetings were co-chaired by the Council Presidency and the President of the Commission. The 2003 Decision also gave a role to the two subsequent Presidencies. In its Communication of 2 October 2013 on the social dimension of the EMU, the Commission announced that it will present a proposal to revise the 2003 Council Decision. This is the aim of this proposal. The amendment of the 2003 Council Decision is also needed as a result of the institutional changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon. In addition, the overall policy framework needs to be revised, replacing the Lisbon Strategy with the Europe 2020 Strategy and specifying how the TSS for Growth and Employment contributes to the overall governance. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to revise the 2003 Council Decision. The main provisions may be summarised as follows: Task: its tasks shall be to: Membership: the main amendments concern the membership of the TSS. The Summit shall consist of the: President of the European Council, The ministers from those three presidencies and the Commissioner responsible for employment and social affairs shall also be present. The social partners\u2019 representatives shall be divided into two delegations of equal size comprising 10 workers\u2019 representatives and 10 employers\u2019 representatives, taking into account the need to ensure a balanced participation between men and women. Each delegation shall consist of representatives of European cross-industry organisations, either representing general interests or more specific interests of supervisory and managerial staff and small and medium-sized businesses at European level. Technical coordination shall be provided for the workers\u2019 delegation by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and for the employers\u2019 delegation by the Confederation of European Business (BUSINESSEUROPE). Technical provisions are set out as regards: Presidency and organisation: the Summit shall be chaired jointly by the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission. The meetings of the Summit shall be convened by the joint chairmen on their own initiative, in consultation with the social partners."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3854EP8, ECR%:0.929, EPP%:0.923, EFD/IDG%:0.354, Greens/EFA%:0.88, NI%:0.173, REG%:0.925, S&D%:0.927, The Left%:0.923, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Bonn Agreement aims to combat pollution in the North Sea Area and safeguard coastal areas from maritime disasters and chronic pollution from ships and offshore installations. The European Union is a Contracting Party to the Agreement. Amendments were made to the agreement in 1989. These amendments entered into force on 1 April 1994. On 7 October 2019, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an amendment to extend the scope of the Bonn Agreement with a view to improving cooperation on surveillance with regard to the requirements of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the \"MARPOL Convention\") and the extension to the Kingdom of Spain under Article 20 of the Agreement. The amendments are now submitted for conclusion by the Union. CONTENT: the proposed Decision provides that the Council authorises the Commission to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the envisaged amendments to the Bonn Agreement relating to the extension of the material scope of the Agreement as regards Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention and the accession of the Kingdom of Spain to the Agreement. The amendments envisaged are the following: The \u2018MARPOL amendment\u2019 \u2013 amending the substantive scope of the Agreement This amendment seeks to improve cooperation and coordination between the Contracting Parties in combating unlawful air emissions caused by shipping in order to limit the negative consequences of the combustion of marine fuels with high sulphur or nitrogen content for human health, biodiversity and the entire marine environment. The adoption of the decision to conclude the amendment on the extension of the mandate of the Bonn Agreement in relation to Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention would improve joint surveillance, monitoring and reporting of ship emissions in the North Sea area. The \u2018Spain amendment\u2019 \u2013 amending the geographical scope of the Agreement This amendment extends the geographical scope of the Agreement to cover the area between the zone of joint responsibility of France and the United Kingdom and the new zone of responsibility of Spain in order to close any gaps between the old boundary of the Bonn Agreement and the new zone of responsibility of Spain.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of targeted contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the basic Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy), Union fishing vessels enjoy equal access to EU waters and resources subject to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. From the end of the transitional period, the Common Fisheries Policy would no longer apply to the United Kingdom. The UK waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will then no longer be part of EU waters. To ensure sustainable fisheries and given the importance of fishing for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the authorisation procedures for fishing vessels. CONTENT: the proposal would amend EU Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 in order to create the appropriate legal framework valid until 31 December 2021, or until the date of conclusion of a fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom - whichever is earlier - on the continued reciprocal access of EU and UK vessels to each other's waters after 31 December 2020. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following the end of the transition period. The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of \"reciprocity\", i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters on a basis satisfactory to the Union. Consequently, authorisations would only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5215EP9, ECR%:1.032, EPP%:0.967, EFD/IDG%:0.836, Greens/EFA%:0.946, NI%:0.614, REG%:0.926, S&D%:0.916, The Left%:0.951, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the instrument of the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon and was made operational on 1 April 2012 by Regulation No 211/2011. The aim of this instrument is to enhance citizens' involvement in the democratic life of the European Union, by allowing them to directly address the Commission with a request to submit a proposal for legal acts of the Union for the purpose of implementing the Treaties. Since its first report on the application of the Regulation adopted in 2015, the Commission has implemented a series of non-legislative measures to facilitate the use of the instrument by organisers and citizens and to mitigate the main problems identified, namely: the difficulties encountered by the organisers in the registration phase including the high rate of refusals to register proposed citizens\u2019 initiatives; the complexity for organisers of initiatives to collect statements of support, as evidenced by the low rate of successful initiatives; differences in requirements for personal data of signatories; low number of initiatives reaching the one million threshold and the limited impact so far generated by citizens' initiatives. The resolution of the European Parliament of 28 October 2015 highlighted a number of problems and called for the revision of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 and the adoption of a package of amendments to improve the functioning of the ECI. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been carried out. The Commission notes, however, that technical and practical measures to simplify the ECI should reduce the administrative burden for both organisers and Member States. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to replace Regulation No 211/2011 with a view to improving the way the ECI operates, with the main policy objectives of: making the ECI more accessible, less burdensome and easier to use for organisers and supporters; achieving the full potential of the ECI as a tool to foster debate and participation , including that of young people, at European level and to bring the EU closer to its citizens. Concretely, the proposal: stipulates the right of every citizen of the Union of at least 16 years of age to support an initiative by signing the statement of support; introduces the requirement to make available an online collaborative platform for the ECI providing a discussion forum as well as information and advice to organisers, support to organisers with regard to the translation of the main elements of their initiatives into all official languages \u200b\u200bof the Union for publication in the Register; provides for the requirements for the organisers of initiatives, including the formation, composition and responsibilities of the group of organisers composed by at least seven citizens of the Union entitled to vote in the elections to the European Parliament and residents of at least seven Member States; provides that statements of support may only be collected after an initiative has been registered and establishes the requirements for the registration or refusal of initiatives; clarifies that statements of support for initiatives may be collected online or in paper form and that only forms which comply with the models set out in Annex III of the Regulation may be used to collect statements of support. Personal data to be provided by the signatory would be reduced; introduces the requirement for the Commission to set-up and operate, by 1 January 2020, a central online collection system made available free of charge to organisers of registered initiatives and allowing citizens to provide support to initiatives online; stipulates the possibility for organisers to set up their own individual online collection systems, the security and technical features for these systems and the procedure for the verification by the competent national authorities in the Member States; provides that each Member State shall verify and certify the statements of support signed by their nationals; lays down the conditions and time limits for the submission of initiatives to the Commission; sets out the publication and public hearing phase for initiatives submitted to the Commission and sets out the conditions for the public hearing at the European Parliament within three months from the submission of the initiative by the organisers; obliges the Commission to receive the group of organisers at an appropriate level as well as to set out in a Communication its legal and political conclusions on the initiative, the actions it intends to take, if any, and its reasons for taking or not taking action; provides for awareness-raising and communication activities on the ECI to be carried out by the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to a number of online systems for the European citizens\u2019 initiative which the Commission will put in place and make available free of charge to citizens and organisers. The estimated impact on expenditure (in commitment appropriations) is estimated at EUR 2.050 million for 2019 and EUR 2.140 million for 2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the conditions for the granting of the Union operating licence to air carriers and establishes the freedom to provide intra-EU air services. In the absence of any provisions to the contrary in a withdrawal agreement, air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulation upon withdrawal. Moreover, certain air carriers, by reason of their holding an operating licence issued by the United Kingdom, or their principal place of business being located in the United Kingdom, or their being majority owned or effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or its nationals, would cease to meet the conditions laid down in the said Regulation to qualify as Union carriers. The carriers in any of the situations described above would lose their Union operating licence and, as a consequence, no longer enjoy the right to provide intra-Union air services. Direct air transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States are almost entirely in the hands of United Kingdom and Union air carriers. The loss by those air carriers of their right to provide air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would therefore result in serious disruption. Most, if not all, air routes between the Union and the United Kingdom would cease to be served. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The Commission considers it necessary to establish a temporary set of measures enabling carriers licensed in the United Kingdom to provide air transport services between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down provisional measures to govern air transport between the Union and the United Kingdom following the latter's withdrawal from the Union. This proposal complements Union Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. Although the approach followed in the Union's air transport agreements with third countries has been respected in some areas (e.g. operating authorisations), the specific purpose and context of this Regulation, as well as its unilateral nature, necessarily require a more restrictive approach in the grant of rights, as well as specific provisions intended to preserve equality of rights and a level playing field. Maintain basic connectivity The proposed Regulation provides for the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories. No distinction is made between passenger and cargo operations, or scheduled and non-scheduled services. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a short transition period ending 30 March, 2020. Reciprocity and fair competition The measures would enter into force subject to the United Kingdom granting equivalent rights to EU air carriers and ensuring fair competition. Otherwise, the Commission would be empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts, including the limitation or withdrawal of operating authorisations of United Kingdom air carriers. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high standards in the area of air transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) non-discrimination of EU carriers in the United Kingdom."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 9258EP8, ECR%:0.629, EPP%:0.796, EFD/IDG%:1.25, Greens/EFA%:0.84, NI%:0.231, REG%:0.776, S&D%:0.796, The Left%:0.731, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner. To tackle climate change effectively and achieve the EU's long-term decarbonisation objectives to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, an important step was taken when the European Council agreed in October 2014 the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy. A centrepiece of the 2030 policy framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically below 1990 levels by 2030. To achieve this target cost-effectively, the sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) will have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 while non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions by 30% compared to 2005. The European Council confirmed that a well-functioning, reformed EU ETS with an instrument to stabilise the market would be the main European instrument to achieve this target. This proposal is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the Strategic Framework for the Energy Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment is largely based on the findings of the comprehensive impact assessment on the 2030 framework, focusing on certain ETS-specific methodological elements not already assessed. It includes (i) addressing the potential risk of carbon leakage, (ii) the establishment of a Modernisation and an Innovation Fund, (iii) optional free allocation to modernise the electricity sector in lower income Member States, as well as (iv) aspects building on the lessons learnt since 2013, such as the validity of emission allowances, guaranteeing a robust and secure registry and the continuation of the optional exclusion of small emitters. CONTENT : technological progress realised over time in the relevant sectors. Sectors deemed to be exposed to a risk of carbon leakage would continue to receive a higher allocation than others who have a higher ability to pass on relevant costs in product prices. maintains the Innovation Fund as a stepped-up effort to rapidly introduce new low-carbon technologies to the market enabling the EU to reach its long-term decarbonisation goals. Existing EU-level support for innovation is supplemented through dedicating 400 million allowances for these purposes. An extra 50 million allowances is added to this amount from the allowances that remain unused in 2013 to 2020 and would otherwise be placed in the Market Stability Reserve in 2020. establishes the Modernisation Fund and optional free allocation to the energy sector to contribute to the modernisation of the energy systems in lower income Member States. The Modernisation Fund is created with 2% of the overall quantity of allowances. These will be auctioned in accordance with the rules provided for in the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation to generate the necessary funds for projects to be carried out. The Commission also proposes that auction revenues should be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate.

Moreover, the mandate referred to provisions for effective cooperation between customs or any other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues. The 9th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Bali on 3-6 December 2013 adopted the Ministerial Decision on Trade Facilitation, which concluded negotiations on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation subject to the legal review of the text. At its meeting on 26 November 2014, the WTO's General Council adopted the Protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and opened it for acceptance by the WTO Members. The Protocol should now be concluded on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to conclude the protocol amending the Marrakesh agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. The protocol includes the Agreement on Trade facilitation and the commitments will become an integral part of the Agreement. The Agreement contains a set of measures designed to improve the cross-border movement of goods by improving transparency, streamlining customs procedures and eliminating red tape. For developing countries, it also contains innovative flexibilities which may become standard in future rules type agreements. The Agreement is divided into two sections: The OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators estimate that comprehensive implementation of all measures of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation would reduce total trade costs by 10% in developed countries and by 13-15.5% in developing countries."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 1404EP8, ECR%:0.886, EPP%:0.914, EFD/IDG%:0.521, Greens/EFA%:0.72, NI%:0.115, REG%:0.866, S&D%:0.937, The Left%:0.019, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

LEGISLATIVE ACT: amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020, proposing among other things, a new Fiscalis 2020 programme. The smooth functioning of taxation systems in the internal market is dependent on effective and efficient processing of cross-border transactions by national tax administrations, the prevention of and fight against tax fraud and protection of tax revenues. This implies exchange of large quantities of information between tax administrations, but also tax administrations working more efficiently and at the same time reducing the administrative, economic and time burden for tax payers involved in cross-border activities. This can only be achieved on the basis of cooperation between tax administrations of the Member States and third parties. Given the increasing globalisation, an efficient fight against fraud should equally have an international dimension. Therefore, the programme will also support the exchange of information with non-Member States in the realm of the international agreements concluded with the non-Member States concerned. The proposed programme is the successor programme of the Fiscalis 2013 programme, which ends on 31 December 2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : considering the overall policy context and problems ahead for customs in the next decade, a number of policy options has been analysed and compared: Option 1: baseline: continuing the programme with the current objectives and design. Option 2: no continuation of the programme. Option 3: upgrade the baseline: this option would encompass the baseline scenario tailoring the objectives to the future challenges. It puts additional focus on the fight against tax fraud, avoidance and evasion, working towards a more efficient tax administration, addressing the high administrative burden for taxpayers and tax administrations and considering the cooperation with third countries and third parties. Option 4: upgrade and cater for new policies: besides addressing the problems described under the Option 3 \", this policy option would offer the means to extend cooperation to new areas that may follow from policy evolution. The impact assessment identified Option 3 \"Upgrade the baseline\" as the preferred option. It is in line with the proposal for a new budget for Europe 2020 and scores best on acceptability by Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 114, 197 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Regulation proposes to establish a multi-annual action programme \"Fiscalis 2020\" covering the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Scope: the proposed Fiscalis 2020 programme will support tax cooperation in the Union clustered around human networking and competency building, on the one hand, and IT capacity building on the other hand. The first cluster allows for the exchange of good practices and operational knowledge amongst the Member States and other countries participating in the programme. The latter enables the programme to fund appropriate IT infrastructure and systems that allow tax administrations in the Union to evolve to fully-fledged e-administrations. The scope of the programme has been brought in line with recent Union tax legislation meaning that it will not only cover VAT, excise duties and taxes on income and capital but also other taxes which are subject of Union tax legislation. The programme will be open to participation by Member States, candidate countries and potential candidates. Countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy will also have the option of taking part in the programme under certain conditions. External experts may also participate in specific actions (e.g. representatives of other authorities, trade, national and international organisations, and possibly other experts), if required to realise the programme objectives. Objectives: these address the problems identified and challenges expected for tax policy and European authorities in the next decade. The specific objective of the programme shall be to improve the operation of the taxation systems, in particular through cooperation between participating countries, their tax authorities, their officials and external experts. The programme will have the following priorities: to support the preparation, coherent application and effective implementation of Union tax law; to fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, in particular by enhancing effective and efficient administrative cooperation and exchange of information to contribute to the reduction of administrative burden on tax administrations and compliance costs for taxpayers to work towards efficient tax administration, in particular as regards tax compliance, and administrative capacity of tax administrations. to enhance a coherent application and implementation of Union tax policy; to enhance cooperation with international organisations, other governmental authorities, third countries, economic operators and their organisations with a view to fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance. The main added value of the programme is generated by enhancing the capacity of Member States in fighting fraud and possibly raising revenue, while cutting costs in developing the tools for these purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the timing of the review of EU funding programmes is linked to the proposal for a new Multiannual Financial Framework . In accordance with that proposal, this Regulation on the Fiscalis 2020 programme contains a budgetary framework of EUR 234 370 000 (in current prices) for the period of 2014-2020. The Fiscalis 2020 programme will be implemented by means of a direct central management mode and in a priority-based manner. Work programmes are established \u2013together with the stakeholders- stipulating the priorities for a specific period."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5232EP7, ECR%:0.667, EPP%:0.817, EFD/IDG%:0.226, Greens/EFA%:0.789, NI%:0.364, REG%:0.807, S&D%:0.836, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: differences in contract law between Member States and the additional transaction costs and complexity that they generate in cross-border transactions dissuade a considerable number of traders, in particular SME, from expanding into markets of other Member States. These differences also have the effect of limiting competition in the internal market. Currently, only one in ten traders in the Union exports goods within the Union and the majority of those who do, only export to a small number of Member States. The value of the trade foregone each year between Member States due to differences in contract law alone amounts to tens of billions of Euros. With its 2001 Communication on European contract law,  the Commission launched a process of extensive public consultation on the problems arising from differences between Member States' contract laws. In July 2010, the Commission launched a public consultation by publishing a 'Green Paper on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses', which set out different policy options on how to strengthen the internal market by making progress in the area of European contract law. In response to the Green Paper, the European Parliament issued a Resolution on 8 June 2011 in which it expressed its strong support for an instrument which would improve the establishment and the functioning of the internal market and bring benefits to traders, consumers and Member States' judicial systems. The Commission Communication 'Europe 2020' recognises the need to make it easier and less costly for traders and consumers to conclude contracts with partners in other Member States, notably by making progress towards an optional European contract law. The Digital Agenda for Europe envisages an optional instrument in European contract law to overcome the fragmentation of contract law and boost consumer confidence in e-commerce. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment analysed the seven policy options set out in the Green Paper. These options were: (1) the baseline scenario (no policy change); (2) a toolbox for the legislator; (3) a Recommendation on a Common European Sales Law; (4) a Regulation setting up an optional Common European Sales Law; (5) a Directive (full or minimum harmonisation) on a mandatory Common European Sales Law; (6i) a Regulation establishing a European contract law; (7) a Regulation establishing a European Civil Code. The establishment of an optional uniform contract law regime (Option 4) was therefore reasoned to be the most proportionate action as it would reduce transaction costs experienced by traders exporting to several Member States and give consumers more product choice at a lower price LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he Proposal provides for the establishment of a Common European Sales Law. It harmonises the national contract laws of the Member States not by requiring amendments to the pre-existing national contract law, but by creating within each Member State's national law a second contract law regime for contracts covered by its scope that is identical throughout the European Union and will exist alongside the pre-existing rules of national contract law. This \u2018second regime\u2019 is characterised by the following features: A contract law regime common to all Member States : the Common European Sales Law will be a 'second regime' of contract law that is identical in every Member State. It will be common for the whole of the EU. An optional regime : the choice of the Common European Sales Law will be voluntary. In line with the principle of freedom of contract, a trader is free to choose to offer a contract under this regime (opt-in system) or to remain with the existing national contract law. Focus on 'sales' contracts : the Common European Sales Law will introduce a self-standing and complete set of rules for sales transactions. This will in particular but not exclusively be useful for the online supply of goods. The Common European Sales Law could also be used, for example when buying music, films, software or applications that are downloaded from the internet. These products would be covered irrespective of whether they are stored on a tangible medium such as a CD or a DVD. Limited to cross-border contracts : the scope of the Common European Sales Law is focussed on cross-border situations where the problems of additional transactions costs and legal complexity arise. The Common European Sales Law is therefore targeted to where it is needed and is not available as a general substitute to existing national contract law. It is left to the discretion of Member States whether to give the regime a wider application. Member States thus have the choice to make the Common European Sales Law also available for domestic contracts \u2013 which could further reduce transaction costs for businesses active on the single market. Focus on B2C contracts and B2B contracts where at least one party is an SME : t he scope of the Common European Sales Law is focussed on aspects which pose real problems in cross-border transactions, i.e. business-to-consumer relations and business-to-business relations where at least one of the parties is an SME. Contracts concluded between private individuals (C2C) and contracts between traders where neither of the parties is an SME are not included. Identical set of consumer protection rules : the Regulation will establish for all the areas of contract law the same common level of consumer protection. A comprehensive set of contract law rules : t he Common European Sales Law includes rules that cover issues of contract law that are of practical relevance during the life-cycle of a cross-border contract. These issues fall within the areas of the rights and obligations of the parties and the remedies for non-performance, pre-contractual information duties, the conclusion of a contract (including formal requirements), the right of withdrawal and its consequences, avoidance resulting from a mistake, fraud or unfair exploitation, interpretation, the contents and effects of a contract, the assessment and consequences of unfairness of contract terms, restitution after avoidance and termination as well as prescription. It settles the sanctions available in case of the breach of the obligations and duties arising under its application. On the other hand, certain topics that are either very important for national laws or less relevant for cross-border contracts \u2013 such as rules on legal capacity, illegality/immorality or representation and the plurality of debtors and creditors \u2013 will not be addressed by the Common European Sales Law. These topics continue to be governed by the rules of the national law that is applicable under the Rome I Regulation. With an international dimension : the proposal also has an international vocation in that, in order to be applicable, it is sufficient that only one party is established in a Member State of the EU. This international vocation enables the Common European Sales Law to become a standard setter for international transactions in the area of sales contracts. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: after the adoption of the proposal, the Commission will set up a database for the exchange of information concerning final judgments referring to the Common European Sales Law or any other provision of the Regulation, as well as relevant judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The costs associated with this data-base are likely to grow as more final judgments become available. At the same time, the Commission will organise training sessions for legal practitioners using the Common European Sales Law. These costs are likely to decrease with time, as knowledge about how the Common European Sales Law works spreads."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6015EP7, ECR%:0.018, EPP%:0.799, EFD/IDG%:0.258, Greens/EFA%:0.0, NI%:0.182, REG%:0.843, S&D%:0.579, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: European Parliament and Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: type-approval requirements for new vehicles of the L-category are currently set out in Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (the \u2018Framework Directive\u2019). In addition, a series of Directives referred to in the Framework Directive contain detailed technical requirements relating to L-category vehicles. The Commission has identified a number of key concerns associated with the current provisions for the type-approval of new L-category vehicles, which need to be addressed: the complexity of the legal framework; the level of emissions and its increasing share in total road transport emissions, which are decreasing overall; vehicle functional safety aspects related to type-approval requirements; the lack of a legal framework for vehicles fitted with new technologies; selling and registration of certain vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units imported in the EU market which do not comply with the current type-approval requirements regarding vehicle functional safety and/or environmental protection. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: for each of the main aspects of the proposal, different options were analysed by listing possible advantages and disadvantages in terms of economic, environmental, safety and societal aspects. Qualitative and quantitative aspects were both included in this analysis. Next, the different options were compared and one preferred option or a logical combination of two preferred options were identified and described. These preferred options form the basis for this new Framework Regulation. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal uses the \u2018split-level approach\u2019 originally introduced at the request of Parliament and used in other legislation for EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach provides for legislation in three steps: the fundamental provisions and scope are laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on Article 114 TFEU in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. the technical specifications associated with the fundamental provisions are laid down in three delegated acts (Article 290), adopted through comitology: an implementing act (Article 291) sets out the administrative provisions, such as the information document, the definitions of the type-approval certificate, the certificate of conformity and associated production conformity requirements, etc. This proposal for a Regulation relates to the first step of this process. It establishes the administrative and technical requirements for the approval and market surveillance of all new L-category vehicles that are intended to travel on public roads, including where designed and constructed in more than one stage. It also establishes the requirements for the sale and entry into service of systems, components and separate technical units intended for vehicles approved in accordance with this Regulation. In the interests of clarity, rationality and simplification, Directive 2002/24/EC and its separate directives should be repealed and replaced by one Regulation and a small number of delegated and implementing acts. This Regulation constitutes a set of specific safety and environmental requirements. It establishes provisions to ensure that, in cases where a vehicle presents a serious risk for users or the environment, the manufacturer or any other economic operator in the supply chain has taken effective protective measures, including the recall of vehicles. In addition, appropriate measures should be taken in order to make sure that systems, components or separate technical units which can be fitted to vehicles, and which could significantly impair the functioning of systems that are essential for environmental protection or functional safety, are subject to prior control by an approval authority before they are sold, registered or are entering into service. To improve market surveillance, the role and responsibilities of the authorities in the Member States in charge of type-approval and market surveillance are clarified. The proposal also reinforces the requirements relating to the competence, obligations and performance of the technical services that perform vehicle type-approval. In order to prevent misuse, any simplified procedure for small-series vehicles should be restricted to cases of very limited production. It is therefore necessary to define precisely the concept of small series in terms of the number of vehicles sold, registered and entered into service. In order to ensure that the procedure for monitoring conformity of production is correctly implemented and functions properly, manufacturers should be regularly checked by the competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service appointed for that purpose. Lastly, Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the European Union budget with regard to the first two emission-limit reduction steps (Euro 4 and 5 for motorcycles, Euro 3 and 4 for all other L-category vehicle categories). The third emission step will include a Euro 6 step motorcycles and a Euro 5 step for all other L-category vehicle categories (mopeds, tricycles and quadricycles). These limits are absolutely equivalent to the Euro 5 emission limits for passenger cars. An additional environmental effect study is planned in order to determine the short-term environmental effects of the Euro 3, 4 and 5 steps and whether the targeted Euro 6 step is appropriate within the given time. This study will be completed in the period 2016-2017 and will be financed through the Commission budget."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3337EP7, ECR%:0.807, EPP%:0.923, EFD/IDG%:0.452, Greens/EFA%:0.93, NI%:0.333, REG%:0.88, S&D%:0.877, The Left%:0.657, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC prohibits the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators, including those incorporated into appliances, that contain more than 0.002% of cadmium by weight therein. However, the portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools have been exempt from that ban. The Commission has reviewed that exemption with a view to the prohibition of cadmium in batteries and accumulators. That review led to the conclusion that, in order to gradually diminish the amount of cadmium released to the environment, the prohibition of the use of cadmium should be extended to portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools as suitable cadmium-free substitutes for these applications are available on the market, namely nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion battery technologies IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission's impact assessment concludes that compared to the baseline scenario the other policy options related to a withdrawal of the exemption (immediate withdrawal or withdrawal in 2016) would lead to a lower overall environmental impact, both in terms of avoiding releases of cadmium to the environment and in terms of aggregated environmental impacts based on six environmental indicators. The impact assessment concludes that if the exemption is withdrawn in 2016, the environmental benefits would be slightly lower than in the case of immediate withdrawal but the costs would be much lower compared to an immediate withdrawal. Over the period 2013-2025, a cordless power tools with alternative battery chemistry will, depending on the alternative battery chemistry chosen (nickel metal hydride or lithium-ion), cost EUR 0.8 and EUR 2.1 more respectively if the exemption is immediately withdrawn and an additional EUR 0.4 and EUR 0.9 respectively in the case of withdrawal in 2016. As withdrawal of the exemption in 2016 would have almost the same level of effectiveness at a higher efficiency compared to an immediate withdrawal, this option is the preferred one. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 2006/66/EC by limiting the exemption for the use of cadmium in portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools to 1 January 2016. This means that as from this date, the use of cadmium in portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools, included those incorporated into appliances, is restricted to 0.002% of cadmium by weight in line with Directive 2006/66/EC. The proposal identifies the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Directive 2006/66/EC and establishes the corresponding procedures for adoption of these acts in accordance with Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the EU on 17 July 1995, which came into force on 1 March 1998. Tunisia is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. In parallel to this political transition process, the Tunisian economy has suffered from continuous domestic unrest, regional instability (including the impact of the Libyan conflicts) and a weak international environment (particularly in the Union, Tunisia\u2019s main trading partner). These unfavourable developments substantially weakened its growth performance, as well as its fiscal and balance of payments positions. Since 2011, the Union has expressed its unequivocal commitment to supporting Tunisia in its economic and political reform process. It has increased its financial support to Tunisia, strengthening its cooperation in many fields, including the civil society the electoral system, security, regional development and social and economic reforms. And it has offered the possibility of concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement, the negotiations of which were launched in October 2014. Tunisia reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion, which was approved by the IMF Board on June 2013, and which was subsequently extended until December 2015. It also requested in August 2013 complementary Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU. In response, the European Commission proposed a MFA of EUR 250 million in December 2013 in the form of loans (MFA-I), which the co-legislators raised to EUR 300 million and approved in May 2014 (Decision No 534/2014/EU). This amount is being successfully implemented. Following the completion of the 6th review of the IMF programme last September, Tunisia requested a successor arrangement with the IMF, probably of a 4-year duration. The new IMF programme is still under negotiation but expected to be sent for IMF Board approval in the spring of 2016. In 2015, the Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by several terrorist attacks that have targeted key economic industries like tourism and transport as well as aiming to disrupt the consolidation of its political transition. In this context, Tunisia requested a second MFA operation from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million, which would accompany the successor IMF programme. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Tunisia for a total maximum amount of EUR 500 million, provided in the form of a medium term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2016-17, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance, to be disbursed in three instalments (EUR 200 million, EUR 150 million and EUR 150 million, respectively), should help the country overcome its difficult economic and balance of payments situation it is experiencing, which has been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks it suffered in 2015 and by persistent domestic and regional unrest. It will also promote structural reforms aimed at raising sustainable economic growth and improving public finance management. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. The disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment). In addition, the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (\"the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund\"). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2016 for a total amount of EUR 350 million and the third loan disbursement in 2017 for the amount of EUR 150 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-2019 budgets. The implications on expenditure (including human resources and administrative costs) are estimated at EUR 45.295 million for 2016-2019."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 3427EP8, ECR%:0.771, EPP%:0.914, EFD/IDG%:0.292, Greens/EFA%:0.94, NI%:0.173, REG%:0.925, S&D%:0.906, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the dynamically growing Southeast Asian economies, with their over 600 million consumers and a rapidly rising middle class, are key markets for European Union exporters and investors. With a total EUR 208 billion of trade in goods and EUR 77 billion of trade in services (2016), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) taken as a whole is the EU\u2019s third largest trading partner outside Europe, after the US and China. At the same time, a total EUR 263 billion foreign direct investment stock (2016) in the ASEAN makes the EU the first foreign direct investor in the ASEAN, while the ASEAN as a whole is in its turn the second largest Asian foreign direct investor in the EU \u2013 with a total foreign direct investment stock of EUR 116 billion (2016). Within the ASEAN, Singapore is by far the EU\u2019s largest partner, accounting for slightly under one-third of EU-ASEAN trade in goods and services, and roughly two-thirds of investments between the two regions. Over 10 000 EU companies are established in Singapore and use it as a hub to serve the whole Pacific Rim. On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Member States of the ASEAN. On 12 September 2011, the Council authorised the Commission to extend the on-going negotiations with Singapore to cover also investment protection, based on a new EU competence under the Lisbon Treaty. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in 2011 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Singapore an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. From the date of its entry into force, the EU-Singapore IPA will replace and supersede the bilateral investment treaties between the Republic of Singapore and EU Member States that are listed in the IPA. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Singapore of the other part. Main aim of the IPA: it aims to: In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured the following: Committee: the institutional chapter of the IPA establishes a committee with the main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement. Among other tasks, the committee may, subject to the completion of each side\u2019s respective legal requirements and procedures, decide to appoint the Members of the ICS Tribunals, fix their monthly retainer and fees, and adopt binding interpretations of the agreement. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU-Singapore FTA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It is estimated that foregone duties could reach an amount of EUR 248.8 million upon full implementation of the agreement. The estimate is based on average imports projected for 2025 in the absence of an agreement and represents the annual loss in revenues resulting from the elimination of EU tariffs on imports from Singapore. The EU-Singapore IPA is expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures. The agreement will be the EU\u2019s second (after the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to incorporate the Investment Court System (ICS) for the resolution of disputes between investors and states. An amount of EUR 200 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2018 onwards (subject to the entry into force of the agreement) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 9170EP8, ECR%:0.857, EPP%:0.873, EFD/IDG%:0.25, Greens/EFA%:0.04, NI%:0.115, REG%:0.925, S&D%:0.524, The Left%:0.019, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission decided that cohesion policy should remain an essential element of the next financial package and underlined its pivotal role in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. It proposed a number of important changes to the way cohesion policy is designed and implemented. Concentrating funding on a smaller number of priorities better linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, focusing on results, monitoring progress towards agreed objectives, increasing the use of conditionalities and simplifying the delivery are among the major hallmarks of the proposal This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The Cohesion Fund helps Member States whose GNI per inhabitant is less than 90% of the EU27 average in making investments in TEN-T transport networks and the environment. Part of the Cohesion Fund allocation (EUR 10 billion) will be ring-fenced to finance core transport networks under the \"Connecting Europe\" Facility. The Cohesion Fund can also support projects related to energy, as long as they clearly present a benefit to the environment, for example by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: options were assessed in particular in relation to the Cohesion Fund contribution to investing in basic infrastructure in transport and environment. Various ways of making funding conditional on a sound macro-fiscal framework were assessed, including: (i) the status quo, with a weak ex-post conditionality which has never been applied; (ii) a strengthened ex post conditionality; (iii) ex ante conditionality, which would require the fulfilment of preconditions before the adoption of the programmes. An evolution of the current system best fulfils the criteria of ownership, transparency and predictability, while at the same time ensuring that the effectiveness of growth-enhancing investments is not undermined by the pursuit of unsound fiscal policies. Such a procedure implies suspension of part or all of commitments in the case of repeated breaches. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation determines the scope of intervention of the Cohesion Fund. It includes an article on scope defining the general areas for intervention within the area of transport and environment. The scope of intervention is also defined by a negative list of activities which will not be eligible for support, and a list of investment priorities. Environment : the Cohesion Fund will support investment in climate change adaptation and risk prevention, investment in the water and waste sectors and the urban environment. Energy : investment in energy is also eligible for support, provided it has positive environmental benefits. Therefore investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy are also supported. Transport : the Cohesion Fund will contribute to investments in the Trans-European Transport Network, as well as low-carbon transport systems and urban transport. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. To ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link, it would be beneficial to retain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single safety authority responsible for the whole of this infrastructure. To this end, it is necessary to adapt Directive (EU) 2016/798. In a parallel and related initiative, the Commission also proposes the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and Council empowering France to negotiate and conclude under certain conditions an international agreement that would maintain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single national safety authority for the Channel Fixed Link.

Extension of the transitional arrangement: PURPOSE: to extend the transitional arrangement for management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and non-UCITS. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 enables retail investors to better understand and compare packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and make better-informed investment decisions. To meet its objectives, Regulation requires PRIIPs manufacturers to comply with a uniform set of product disclosure requirements and provide retail investors with a key information document (KID) on each PRIIP they offer. Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS within the meaning of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a KID.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union (EU) has granted trade preferences to developing countries through the Generalised Scheme of Tariff Preferences (GSP scheme) since 1971. It is part of its common commercial policy, in accordance with the general provisions governing the EU\u2019s external action. It is one of the key EU trade instruments assisting developing countries in their efforts to ensure core human and labour rights, reduce poverty and promote sustainable development and good governance in developing countries. The Generalised System of Preferences helps developing countries, and particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs), to reduce poverty by offering them import preferences in order to generate or boost revenue from international trade. In addition, the scheme provides incentives in the form of additional tariff preferences, to countries that commit themselves to sustainable development and good government. The scheme grants preferential access to EU markets on a generalised and non-discriminatory basis to 176 eligible countries and territories. It has three arrangements: the general arrangement (often described simply as \"GSP\"); the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (described as \"GSP+\") which offers additional preferences as incentives to support vulnerable developing countries in ratifying and implementing 27 international conventions on human and labour rights, environment and good governance; the Everything But Arms arrangement (EBA), which provides duty-free, quota-free access to LDCs. The present GSP scheme is implemented through successive regulations, each applying for three years. The current GSP regulation will expire on 31 December 2011. A recently completed midterm review provides the background for the planned Commission proposal for a revised regulation to replace the existing scheme upon expiry in 2013. Both the EBA arrangement and the rules of origin provisions fall outside the scope of this revision: the former, because it is not subject to periodic reviews; and the latter, because new legislation on rules of origin has entered into force in 2011. The proposed GSP Regulation herewith revises, adapts and updates the GSP scheme in replacement of the current regulation, so as to better reflect the contemporary global economic and trade landscape which has changed significantly since the original scheme was put into place. Option A : discontinuation: preferences are abandoned for GSP and GSP+ beneficiaries. EBA arrangement would remain. The economic and social effects for countries most in need are expected to be negative. LDCs would benefit, but the many other developing countries and economic sectors which are also most in need would suffer as preferential access disappears. This option would however have positive economic and social impacts for certain sectors in certain Member States at a time when so much emphasis is on boosting competitiveness, growth and job creation. And last, at a time of extreme pressure on public finances, it boosts tariff revenues. Option B : no policy change: there is a natural reduction in the level of import duties (and, therefore, preferences) due to preference erosion under the impact of further bilateral and multilateral trade deals. In the long run, when all multilateral and bilateral agreements are fully implemented, duties are likely to be so low that the idea of preferences becomes largely irrelevant \u2013 and so would a generalised system of preferences. Other totally different tools may have to be designed. Until then, the question is what can be done for the countries most in need of preferences. Option C : partial redesign: this comprises two sub-options (C1 and C2). Preferences are deferred for certain eligible countries: overseas countries and territories; high and upper middle income countries; countries with a preferential trade agreement covering substantially all preferences. The main difference between C2 and C1 concern the graduation of competitive sectors and the vulnerability criteria under GSP+. Option D : full redesign: in order to simplify the analysis, D sub-options are calculated as increments to C2 only. Three sub-options are assessed. D1 is a far reaching option. It provides full product coverage expansion and elimination of all sensitive products (eg, extending the duty-free, quota-free treatment of EBA countries) to all countries most in need (whether GSP or GSP+). This implies that the remaining beneficiaries are no longer subject to graduation. D2 and D3 are less far-reaching. They take all the parameters of C2 (graduation included) and add partial de-sensitisation (D2) and partial expansion in product coverage (D3). draft proposal would focus the GSP preferences on the countries most in need. This is achieved by enhancing GSP modalities related to the GSP eligibility criteria and the GSP graduation mechanism, which identifies competitive imports and suspends unwarranted preferences. Modification of the GSP+ mechanism : the scheme also expands its support under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) for those countries that commit to embracing core universal values on human, labour rights, environment and governance. While offering further opportunities for potential beneficiaries, the scheme will place more responsibility for countries and require stricter scrutiny of eligibility by the EU. special arrangement for least developing countries known as \u2018Everything But Arms\u2019, which was added to the GSP scheme in 2004, is unchanged and further supported by new elements in the scheme reflecting the aim of focusing GSP benefits on countries most in need."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 2951EP7, ECR%:0.754, EPP%:0.839, EFD/IDG%:0.194, Greens/EFA%:0.035, NI%:0.303, REG%:0.807, S&D%:0.749, The Left%:0.0, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the secondary movements of irregular migrants and the increase of cross-border terrorist threats posing a serious threat to the internal security of a number of Schengen States, some Members States have been compelled to extend the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls. Based on the current Schengen rules, border controls at internal borders are possible for longer than six months when there are serious deficiencies in the external border management of a Member State, as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation. In situations where the serious threat to public policy or internal security is not related to deficiencies in the management of the external borders as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation, the reintroduction of border control at internal borders is subject to the conditions and time limits set out in the Schengen Borders Code. While the current rules for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls have proved sufficient in the vast majority of cases, the maximum periods laid down in the legislation may not be sufficient when Member States face serious and persistent threats to public order or internal security. This is why the Commission considers it necessary to adapt the maximum periods for the temporary reintroduction of border checks to current needs, while ensuring that the use of this measure remains exceptional and is decided only as a last resort. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to update the Schengen Borders Code to prolong the time limits for internal border controls. Stronger procedural safeguards are also being introduced to ensure that border controls at internal borders remain an exception - a measure of last resort - and are used only if necessary and proportionate, limiting the impact on free movement. The Commission proposes: to increase up to one year (instead of six months) the maximum time limit for temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat and to increase from up to 30 days to up to six months the limit for the length of prolongation periods; to introduce better procedural safeguards in order to ensure that the decision on temporary border control at internal borders or their prolongation is based on a proper risk assessment and is taken in cooperation with the other Member States concerned. Member States will prepare and submit a risk assessment assessing how long the identified threat is expected to persist and which sections of the internal borders are affected and how border control contributed to address the identified threat; to introduce a better follow up to the opinion of the Commission expressing concerns on the necessity or proportionality of border controls being exercised for longer than six months and the consultation procedure involving the Commission, Member States and, as now proposed, relevant Agencies; a new possibility is introduced to extend internal border controls by a maximum period of two years where the serious threat to internal security or public policy persists beyond the one-year deadline , provided that it can be attributed to the same grounds (e.g. threat related to the operation of a cross-border terrorist network) and that commensurate exceptional national measures are taken within the territory to address the threat (such as the state of emergency). Such prolongation would require a Recommendation of the Council, which would need to take into account the opinion given by the Commission, and would be strictly limited to 6 month periods with the possibility to prolong no more than three times up to a maximum period of two years."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 8195EP8, ECR%:0.014, EPP%:0.054, EFD/IDG%:0.333, Greens/EFA%:0.86, NI%:0.077, REG%:0.821, S&D%:0.859, The Left%:0.673, General Majority:0, Left Majority:1, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 epidemic crisis is hampering growth in the Member States, exacerbating the severe liquidity shortages resulting from the sharp and sudden increase in public investment needed in their health systems and other sectors of their economies. This creates an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed by specific measures. The lack of public funds in Member States should not hamper investments under programmes supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF), as well as the European Fund for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (EFFAMP), which are necessary to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to release funds to fight the crisis, it is necessary to rapidly mobilise cash reserves from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESF) - the money available to the EU under the Cohesion Fund. This would make financial means available to Member States' budgets without delay. CONTENT: the Commission proposes a \u2018Coronavirus response investment initiative\u2019 to promote investment by mobilising the cash reserves available in the European Structural and Investment Funds to tackle this crisis without delay. Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 , (EU) No 1301/2013 and (EU) No 508/2014 would be amended accordingly. The proposed investment initiative consists of the following elements: Mobilisation of EUR 37 billion of European public investment The investments shall be sizeable and shall rapidly reach more than EUR 37 billion. To achieve this, the Commission proposes to release about EUR 8 billion of investment liquidity. In order to quickly direct these EUR 37 billion of European public investment to address the consequences of the coronavirus crisis, the Commission proposes to relinquish this year\u2019s obligation to request refunding of unspent pre-financing for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) until programme closure. Member States should normally have reimbursed by the end of June 2020 a total of around EUR 8 billion of unused pre-financing received for 2019. They should now be allowed to keep this money. Taking into account the average co-financing rates among Member States, this EUR 8 billion would, in combination with co-financing from the EU budget of around EUR 29 billion, mobilise a total EU budget support of EUR 37 billion. Flexibility in applying EU spending rules In order to provide more flexibility in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, it is proposed to give more flexibility to Member States in programme implementation of programmes and to provide for a simplified procedure not requiring a Commission decision in case of modifications to operational programmes. In order to respond to the impact of the crisis: - financial instruments financed by the Funds should also provide support in the form of working capital to SMEs if necessary as a temporary measure to provide an effective response to a public health crisis; - the ERDF investment priority to strengthen research, technological development and innovation can cover investment in products and services necessary for fostering the crisis response capacities in health services; - the EMFF to safeguard the income of aquaculture producers by contributing to an aquaculture stock insurance covering economic losses due to a public health crisis. In order to provide an immediate response to the impact of the crisis, expenditure for operations for fostering crisis response capacities should be eligible as of 1 February 2020. A Task Force has been setup to coordinate work with Member States, identify their precise needs and assist them so as to ensure that the money starts flowing as soon as possible. The proposed amendment does not entail any change in the annual ceilings of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework for commitments and payments. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund remains unchanged. The proposal shall facilitate the acceleration of the programme implementation resulting in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission shall carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts. The non-recovered amounts in 2020 shall be cleared at programme closure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 834EP9, ECR%:0.984, EPP%:0.94, EFD/IDG%:0.836, Greens/EFA%:0.905, NI%:0.702, REG%:0.926, S&D%:0.935, The Left%:0.951, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF PARLIAMENT : the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the EU is a Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (\"the Convention\"), which established the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (\"ICCAT\"). At its 16th Special Meeting in 2008, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 08-05 to establish a new recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, and Regulation (EC) No 302/20095 was adopted to implement those international conservation measures at Union level. This was later amended by Regulation (EU) No 500/2012. At its 18th Special Meeting in 2012, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 12-03, which provides for: \u00b7 a modification of the fishing seasons; \u00b7 defining fishing seasons as open seasons, as opposed to closed seasons indicated in the previous ICCAT Recommendations; \u00b7 a modification of the actual dates when fishing is permitted by purse seiners, bait boats and trolling boats; \u00b7 explicitly allowing all other gears the possibility of fishing all year round to avoid any uncertainty for those gears which are not subject to any specific rules on fishing seasons. Pending the entry into force of ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 and its comprehensive implementation, this proposal aims to modify the provisions on fishing seasons in Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 in order to ensure effective conservation of the bluefin tunastock. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. Member States concerned by this fishery (Cyprus, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Malta and Portugal) were consulted on 11th December 2012 on the need to clarify the dates of the fishing season, and are agreed on the modifications to the dates of the fishing season. LEGAL BASIS : Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union CONTENT : this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 to reflect ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 regarding fishing seasons. Fishing seasons : bluefin tuna fishing will be permitted in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean: \u00b7 by large-scale pelagic long line catching vessels over 24 m during the period from 1 January to 31 May with the exception of the area delimited by West of 10\u25e6W and North of 42\u25e6N, where such fishing shall be permitted from 1 August to 31 January; \u00b7 by purse seine fishing during the period from 26 May to 24 June; \u00b7 by bait boats and trolling boats during the period from 1 July to 31 October; \u00b7 by pelagic trawlers in the eastern Atlantic during the period from 16 June to 14 October ; \u00b7 as recreational and sport fishing from 16 June to 14 October. Fishing for Bluefin tuna by other gears than those mentioned above will be permitted throughout the year. Date of application: this amendment will apply with retroactive effect from 1 January 2013. This will allow Member States properly to define their fishing capacity and inspection plans which are linked to the fishing seasons and ensure legal certainty.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as \u2018Stage V\u2019, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 1936EP9, ECR%:1.016, EPP%:0.929, EFD/IDG%:0.877, Greens/EFA%:0.905, NI%:0.526, REG%:0.926, S&D%:0.909, The Left%:0.488, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in view of the Plan of Implementation adopted at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, the European Community is committed inter alia to maintaining or restoring stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield with the aim of achieving these goals for depleted stocks on an urgent basis and where possible not later than 2015. Moreover, during the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the Commission and Council agreed to implement multi-annual plans and recovery plans concerning fisheries resources of interest to the Community. The Western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel is by far the most important of the three horse mackerel stocks which inhabit the Community's continental shelf. The current management system does not serve the horse mackerel situation very well. The biological information on this stock is not sufficient for a full stock assessment that would allow setting a fishing mortality target related to maximum sustainable yield and relate total allowable catches to scientific catch predictions. However, the index of egg abundance which is being calculated since 1977 in triennial international surveys can be used as a biological indicator for the development of the stock size. Advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) indicates that a harvest control rule based on the trend in egg abundance from the last three egg surveys would provide for sustainable stock management. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered three options: Option 1 : no policy change: continue fixing the fishing possibilities as a yearly ad hoc exercise based on annual scientific advice and political considerations; Option 2 : freezing or gradually reducing fishing pressure in view of the insufficient knowledge about the biological status of the stock; Option 3: management plan . The impact assessment concludes that the most suitable option is the one that consists of proposing a long-term management plan, which sets TACs stable for three years according to a harvest control rule based on a precautionary advice for the harvest level adjusted by a trend that reflects the tri-annual results of egg surveys. CONTENT: the plan's objective is to maintain the biomass of western horse mackerel at a level that ensures its sustainable exploitation, and to provide the highest long-term yield. To this end, the harvest control rule should be based in equal parts on precautionary advice given for average recruitment conditions, and on recent total allowable catches adjusted by a factor that reflects the recent trend in the stock abundance as measured through egg production. The proposal includes a provision for evaluation of management measures each sixth year from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. In view of the revision clause built into the plan, the harvest rule could be adapted to more precise scientific assessments once these are available.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit Declaration of 7 May 2009, the Union and the partner countries expressed their political support towards liberalisation of the visa regime in a safe and secure environment and reaffirmed their intention to take gradual steps towards a visa free regime for their citizens in due course. On that basis, the Commission presented on 12 November 2010, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate Agreements with the Republic of Belarus on, respectively, the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas, and readmission of persons residing without authorisation. Negotiations with Belarus were officially opened in Brussels on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an agreement initialled on 17 June 2019. In the meantime, Belarus, the European Union and seven participating Member States (Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Finland and Latvia) signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership on 13 October 2016. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Belarus on the facilitation of the issuance of visas. The purpose of the Agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issuance of visas to citizens of the Union and Belarus for intended stays of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - for all visa applicants, a decision on whether or not to issue a visa must, in principle, be taken within 10 calendar days. This period may be extended to a maximum of 30 calendar days when further examination is required. In urgent cases, it may be reduced to two working days or less; - the amount of fees charged for processing visa applications from citizens of the European Union and Belarus shall be EUR 35. These fees shall apply to all visa applicants. In addition, the following categories of persons shall be exempt from these visa fees: children under 12 years of age, persons with disabilities, close relatives, members of official delegations; - the documents required to justify the purpose of the trip have been simplified for certain categories of applicants (e.g. close relatives, business people, members of official delegations, primary and secondary school pupils, students, persons participating in scientific, cultural and sporting events, journalists, etc.); - simplified conditions are provided for the issue of multiple-entry visas valid from 1 to 5 years to certain categories of persons (e.g. members of governments, parliaments and courts, permanent members of official delegations, spouses and children visiting European Union citizens legally residing in the territory of Belarus, or citizens of the Republic of Belarus legally residing in a Member State, persons participating in official, scientific or cultural exchange programmes or cross-border programmes, international sports events); - citizens of the European Union and citizens of Belarus holding a valid biometric diplomatic passport and holders of a valid EU laissez-passer are exempt from the visa requirement for short stays. However, the final assessment of Belarus\u2019 system of issuance will have to be made by the Commission, in consultation with the Member States, before the conclusion of the Agreement. The importance of the fundamental principles governing the cooperation between the Parties as well as the obligations and responsibilities, including the respect of human rights and democratic principles, stemming from the relevant international instruments to which they are bound, is underlined in a preamble to the Agreement.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission decided that cohesion policy should remain an essential element of the next financial package and underlined its pivotal role in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. It proposed a number of important changes to the way cohesion policy is designed and implemented. Concentrating funding on a smaller number of priorities better linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, focusing on results, monitoring progress towards agreed objectives, increasing the use of conditionalities and simplifying the delivery are among the major hallmarks of the proposal. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by correcting imbalances between its regions. The ERDF supports regional and local development by co-financing investments in R&D and innovation; climate change and environment; business support to SMEs; services of common economic interest; telecommunication, energy and transport infrastructures; health, education and social infrastructures; and sustainable urban development. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a certain number of options were assessed in particular in relation to the ERDF contribution to two public goods: (i) contribution to employment, R&D and innovation through enterprise support; (ii) investing in basic infrastructure (e.g. transport, energy, environment, social and health infrastructure). The options examined included the status quo, changes to make funding more targeted, and an option which would be significantly more restrictive in scope compared with current funding options. The option of increased targeting was chosen, which increases the efficiency, effectiveness and EU added value of funding, but at the same time leaves regions sufficient flexibility regarding investment, and minimises the risk that activities requiring funding fall outside the scope of intervention. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 178 and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation determines the scope of intervention of the ERDF, and also defines a negative list of activities which will not be eligible for support. It defines investment priorities for each of the thematic objectives. Thematic objectives : transition regions and more developed regions will be required to focus the largest part of their allocation (except for the ESF) on energy efficiency and renewable energy, competitiveness of SMEs, and innovation. Less developed regions will be able to devote their allocation to a wider range of objectives reflecting the broader range of development needs. The mechanism proposed provides that: at least 80% of resources are focused on energy efficiency and renewables, research and innovation and SME support in more developed and transition regions of which 20% for energy efficiency and renewables. Given the ongoing restructuring needs in those regions phasing out from the Convergence objective, the minimum percentage shall be reduced to 60%; at least 50% of resources are focused on energy efficiency and renewables, research and innovation and SME support in less developed regions of which 6% for energy efficiency and renewables. Sustainable urban development : the proposed Regulation provides for an increased focus on sustainable urban development. The increased focus is to be achieved through the earmarking of a minimum of 5% of ERDF resources for sustainable urban development, the establishment of an urban development platform to promote capacity building and exchange of experience, and the adoption of a list of cities where integrated actions for sustainable urban development will be implemented. Regions suffering from severe natural or demographic handicaps : the proposal states that particular attention shall be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions. Outermost regions : lastly, the proposed Regulation includes specific measures shall be adopted to take account of the structural social and economic situation of the outermost regions, which is compounded by certain specific features which severely restrain their development. The specific measures shall include conditions of access to the Structural Funds. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund). The present proposal establishes minimum shares for the ESF for each category of regions defined in the proposal for a General Regulation. This results in a minimum overall share for the ESF of 25 % of the budget allocated to cohesion policy (excluding the allocation to the Connecting Europe Facility), i.e. EUR 84 billion. This implies that a maximum of EUR 183,3 billion remains available for the ERDF for the period 2014-2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is to ensure an exploitation of living biological resources that is sustainable economically, environmentally and socially. The Union has been a contracting party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) since 14 November 1997. ICCAT has the authority to adopt recommendations on the conservation and management of the fisheries under its competence, which are binding on the contracting parties. As part of the measures to regulate bluefin tuna stocks and to improve the quality and reliability of statistical data, and in order to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing, ICCAT adopted a recommendation introducing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme (BCD) and a recommendation developing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme by introducing a mandatory electronic document system (eBCD). The purpose of this proposal is to transpose and implement existing ICCAT measures, which are binding upon the contracting parties. CONTENT: this proposal establishes a Union bluefin tuna catch documentation programme to implement the conservation and management measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas relating to bluefin tuna catch documentation programme and the mandatory use of the electronic bluefin tuna catch documentation system with a view to identifying the origin of all bluefin tuna. Specifically, the proposal: - lays down general provisions on the use of bluefin catch and re-export certificates and sets rules for the recording and validation of catch and subsequent trade events of bluefin tuna. Particular rules are set for tagged fish; - introduces additional provisions on verification before validation, transmission of data from eBCD users, the use of paper eBCD in exceptional cases and annual reporting to ICCAT; - sets out a detailed list of cases where delegated powers are requested to address frequent changes to the recommendations adopted by ICCAT."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 11400EP9, ECR%:1.0, EPP%:0.956, EFD/IDG%:0.342, Greens/EFA%:0.905, NI%:0.526, REG%:0.926, S&D%:0.935, The Left%:0.927, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: China is among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the Schengen area. EU citizens also need a visa to enter China. In the context of the EU-China Mobility and Migration Dialogue established in October 2013, the European Union and China agreed on a cooperation package comprising measures in the area of irregular migration and visa policy that would be negotiated or implemented in two interdependent phases: On 14 September 2015 the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China for a short-stay visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic passports and addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations were opened on 21 September. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators of the EU and China respectively on 3 and 4 November 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and China on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports. The main provisions of the proposal may be summarised as follows: Purpose and scope: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for citizens of the European Union holding a valid diplomatic passport or an EU laissez-passer and for citizens of China holding a valid diplomatic passport when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that China may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom and Ireland are therefore not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application. Duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as these Member States ((currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania) are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the Chinese holders of diplomatic passports to stay for 90 days in any 180-day period on the territory of each of those Member States, independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Visits by high officials: the agreement stipulates that officials at or above vice-ministerial level of the central government and officers of or above the rank of major general of the armed forces must inform the competent authorities of the country to be visited through diplomatic channels before they travel to its territory for official purposes. Exchange of specimens: the agreement provides for the exchange of specimens of diplomatic passports and the EU laissez-passer no later than 90 days after the date of signature of the agreement. Territorial application: the agreement clarifies that the visa waiver for Chinese holders of diplomatic passports only applies to the European territories of France and the Netherlands. Joint declarations: a joint declaration on the interpretation of the period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. In addition to the joint declaration, two other joint declarations are attached to the agreement regarding: The agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the agreement whose tasks include, among others, the monitoring of its implementation as well as suggesting amendments or additions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 4085EP8, ECR%:0.671, EPP%:0.914, EFD/IDG%:0.562, Greens/EFA%:0.98, NI%:0.192, REG%:0.881, S&D%:0.911, The Left%:0.827, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the internal market is one of the EU\u2019s greatest successes. Nevertheless, it has to continuously adapt to a rapidly changing environment characterised by digital revolution and globalisation. Still, barriers to a proper functioning of the internal market remain and new obstacles are emerging. Moreover, only 6 % of EU citizens feel well informed about their rights as a citizen of the Union and only 36 % feel fairly well informed. Action is required at EU level to ensure the consistent development of the internal market; non-discrimination; consumer protection; effective competition; the development of Member States\u2019 capabilities and of cooperation between them; and the tackling of cross-border issues. Under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, the proposed new programme brings together activities financed under five previous programmes in the areas of business competitiveness (COSME), consumer protection (Regulation (EU) No 254/2014), customers and end-users in financial services (Regulation (EU) 2017/826), policy making in financial services (Regulation (EU) 258/2014) and the food chain (Regulation (EU) 652/2014) respectively. All of these activities are united by their shared objectives to regulate, implement, facilitate, enforce and protect various activities and actors within the internal market. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the programme for improving the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness of enterprises, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the framework for financing of development, production and dissemination of European statistics. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021 to 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The scope of the proposed programme covers the areas of the internal market, SME competitiveness and European statistics in a comprehensive way. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: making the internal market work better : the objective is to facilitate the prevention and removal of obstacles and to support the development, implementation and enforcement of the Union law in the areas of the internal market for goods and services, public procurement, market surveillance as well as in the areas of company law and contract and extra-contractual law, anti-money laundering, free movement of capital, financial services and competition, including the development of governance tools; improving the competitiveness of businesses, especially SMEs : improving the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular SMEs: building on the success of the current COSME programme, the Commission proposes to strengthen support for small enterprises to facilitate their access to markets, including the internationalisation of SMEs, the business environment, the competitiveness of certain sectors, the modernisation of industry and the promotion of entrepreneurship. SME loan guarantees previously granted under the COSME programme shall now be granted under the SME component of InvestEU; increasing standardisation : the programme shall also enable the financing of European standardisation and stakeholder participation in setting up European standards. It shall support the development of high-quality international financial reporting and auditing standards; promoting the interests of consumers : the programme shall empower, assist and educate consumers, businesses and civil society by: (i) ensuring a high level of consumer protection, sustainable consumption and product safety notably by supporting competent enforcement authorities and consumer representative organisations and cooperation actions; (ii) ensuring that all consumers have access to redress and; provision of adequate information on markets and consumers; (iii) enhancing the participation of consumers, other financial services end-users and civil society in financial services policy-making; (iv) promoting a better understanding of the financial sector; contributing to a high level of health for humans, animals and plants throughout the food chain : funding shall support the safe production of food, the prevention and eradication of animal diseases and plant pests, and the improvement of animal welfare in the EU. It shall also promote market access for EU food producers, contribute to exports to third-countries, and significantly support the agri-food industry as a leading sector of the EU economy; producing and communicating high-quality statistics on Europe : the programme establishes the financial framework for providing high-quality, comparable and reliable European statistics to underpin the design, monitoring and evaluation of all the Union policies. This replaces the predecessor European statistical programme. The proposed programme also includes new initiatives aimed at improving the functioning of the internal market, such as the initiative \u2018An ambitious and innovative competition policy for a stronger Union in the digital age, Joint Cluster Initiative\u2019 (e.g. to respond to market developments linked to the use of big data and algorithms) and the initiative for collaborations between clusters or clusters of businesses. Implementation of the Programme shall be based on annual or multi-annual work programme or programmes. The contribution of the programme to the overall objective of increasing the share of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives to 25% shall be monitored. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 4.089 billion for the period 2021-2027. This shall be supplemented by an allocation of EUR 2 billion from the InvestEU Fund, in particular its SME window, which shall make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Regulation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 9044EP8, ECR%:0.329, EPP%:0.905, EFD/IDG%:0.333, Greens/EFA%:0.92, NI%:0.115, REG%:0.955, S&D%:0.853, The Left%:0.038, General Majority:0, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the healthcare sector is one of the largest in the EU: it accounts for approximately 10% of the EU\u2019s gross domestic product and employs one in ten workers, with a higher than average proportion of workers with tertiary-level education. Health therefore plays an important role in the Europe 2020 agenda . As underlined in its Communication of 29 June 2011 entitled \u201c A budget for Europe 2020 \u201d, this third programme of EU action in the field of health (2014-2020), \u2018Health for Growth\u2019, strengthens and emphasises the links between economic growth and a healthy population to a greater extent than the previous programmes. The Programme is geared towards actions with clear EU added value. The general objectives of the Health for Growth Programme shall be to work with Member States to: encourage innovation in healthcare, increase the sustainability of health systems, and improve the health of the EU citizens and protect them from cross-border health threats. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment looked at different options for the programme and their expected impact: Option 1 : minimal action: this option corresponds to the absolute minimum of actions resulting from the legal obligations imposed by the Treaty and the existing EU acquis in the field of medicinal products, medical devices, substances of human origin, patients rights in cross border healthcare, Health security (cross border health threats) and tobacco. Option 2 : baseline scenario: this option implies continuing the programme in its present form with no changes consequently to the findings of the evaluations, in addition to the direct legal obligations. \u00b7  Option 3, sub-option A : this option corresponds to a well structured programme, with SMART objectives, prioritised actions, creating EU added value and with better monitoring of outcomes and impacts. It will be focused on: i) supporting actions required by the current EU health and internal market legislation, ii) supporting the up-take of innovative solutions for improving specific points concerning the quality, efficiency and sustainability of health systems, iii) prevention of diseases at EU level by helping and complementing Member States\u2019 efforts to increase their citizens\u2019 number of healthy life years (HLY), including the aspect of reduction of health inequalities but mainly by other means than the resources of the Programme and limited to development of working methods and policy evaluation; iv) supporting and complementing Member States efforts in protecting citizens from cross-border health threats. \u00b7  Sub-option 3, sub-option B: this option corresponds to a well structured programme but dealing only with one of the general objectives as a trade off. This programme would be focused on: i) supporting actions required by the current EU health and internal market legislation, ii) supporting the up-take of innovative solutions for improving specific points concerning the quality, efficiency and sustainability of health, iii) supporting and complementing Member States efforts in protecting citizens from cross-border health threats. \u00b7  Sub-option 3, sub-option C: this option corresponds to a programme limited to supporting actions required by the current EU health related legislation and to supporting solutions for cross border health threats. In addition, there would be some dissemination of the results of the current Health Programme (2008\u20132013) in order to take into account the conclusions of previous evaluations. Option 4: this corresponds to a well-structured programme focusing on the same issues as option 3 A but adding a specific objective for addressing wider, social and economic, causes of health inequalities by appropriate financial means. This option would imply a significant increase of the envelope for the Programme. Following analysis of the results, Option 3A is the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 168 (5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the general objectives of the Health for Growth Programme shall be to work with Member States to encourage innovation in healthcare and increase the sustainability of health systems, to improve the health of the EU citizens and protect them from cross-border health threats. It focuses on four specific objectives with a strong potential for economic growth through better health: 1) to develop common tools and mechanisms at EU level to address shortages of resources, both human and financial and to facilitate up-take of innovation in healthcare in order to contribute to innovative and sustainable health systems; 2) to increase access to medical expertise and information for specific conditions also beyond national borders and to develop shared solutions and guidelines to improve healthcare quality and patient safety in order to increase access to better and safer healthcare for EU citizens; 3) to identify, disseminate and promote the up-take of validated best practices for cost-effective prevention measures by addressing the key risk factors, namely smoking, abuse of alcohol and obesity, as well as HIV/AIDS, with a focus on the cross border dimension, in order to prevent diseases and promote good health; and 4) to develop common approaches and demonstrate their value for better preparedness and coordination in health emergencies in order to protect citizens from crossborder health threats. Eligible actions: the proposal lays down the actions eligible under the programme. Actions that will be eligible will be those that: Contribute to innovative and sustainable health systems : e.g. developing EU cooperation on Health Technology Assessment; promoting the uptake of health innovation and e-Health by increasing the interoperability of e-Health applications; supporting the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, a pilot project under Europe 2020 flagship initiative Innovation Union; fostering a health knowledge system,\u2026 Increase access to better and safer healthcare for citizens : e.g. supporting action on rare diseases including creation of European Reference Networks; strengthening collaboration on patient safety and quality of healthcare, by increasing the availability of information to patients, exchanging of best practices and development of guidelines; developing guidelines to improve the prudent use of antimicrobials in human medicine and reducing the practices that increase antimicrobial resistance,\u2026 Promote good health and preventing diseases : e.g. exchanging best practices on key health issues such as smoking prevention, abuse of alcohol and obesity; supporting the prevention of chronic diseases including cancer, by sharing knowledge and best practice and developing joint activities,\u2026 Protect citizens from cross border health threats : e.g. strengthening preparedness and response for serious cross border health threats; supporting capacity building against health threats in Member States,\u2026 A more detailed description of the content those actions may have is included in Annex I of the proposed Regulation. Participation of third countries: the Programme shall be open on a cost basis, to the participation of third countries, in particular of: \u00b7 acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates benefiting from a pre-accession strategy, \u00b7  EFTA/EEA countries, \u00b7  neighbouring countries and the countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) applies, \u00b7  other countries in accordance with the conditions laid down by a relevant bilateral or multilateral agreement. Types of intervention and participation: financial contributions by the Union may take the form of either grants or public procurement or any other interventions necessary for achieving the objectives of the Programme. The proposal describes the forms of intervention by type of action eligible. Overall; the design of the revised programme favours simplification of interventions: \u00b7  simplified rules, \u00b7  reducing the costs of participation, \u00b7  accelerating award procedures, and \u00b7 providing a \"one-stop shop\" to make it easier for beneficiaries to access EU funding. Budget and rate of co-financing : the programme will have a budget of EUR 446 million from 2014-2020. The level of Union co-financing for grants for actions, actions co-financed by the competent authorities of the Member States or third countries, or by non-governmental bodies mandated by these authorities and operating grants will be harmonised at 60% of eligible costs and up to 80% in cases of exceptional utility. Provisions are foreseen to define the rules regarding eligibility for grants for actions covered by the Programme. Grants may be awarded to legally established organisations, public authorities, public sector bodies, in particular research and health institutions, universities and higher education establishments and undertakings, in accordance with strictly defined criteria. Administrative and technical assistance : the financial allocation for the Programme may also cover expenses pertaining to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities required directly for the management of the Programme and the achievement of its objectives, in particular studies, meetings, information and communication actions, including corporate communication of the political priorities of the EU, as well as all other technical and administrative assistance expense incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme. Methods of implementation: the Commission shall be responsible for the implementation of the Programme by drawing up annual work programmes establishing the priorities and actions to be undertaken, as well as other detailed eligibility criteria for the beneficiaries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Consistency and complementarity with other policies: the Commission shall, in cooperation with the Member States, ensure overall consistency and complementarity between the Programme and other policies, instruments and actions of the Union. Monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of results: the usual methods of monitoring, evaluation, dissemination of results and combating fraud are foreseen in the proposal. The Commission shall, in close cooperation with the Member States, monitor the implementation of the actions under the programme in the light of its objectives and indicators and keep the European Parliament informed thereof. Reporting : no later then mid-2018, an evaluation report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of all the measures (at the level of results and impacts), the efficiency of the use of resources and its European added value, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the measures. The longer-term impacts and the sustainability of effects of the Health for Growth Programme should be evaluated with a view to feeding into a decision on a possible renewal, modification or suspension of a subsequent programme. It should be noted that the Member States shall designate National Focal Points which shall assist the Commission in the promotion of the Programme, the dissemination of its results and the information on its impacts in their respective countries. Repeal: Decision No 1350/2007/EC shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the financial appropriations for implementing the programme over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 will amount to EUR 446 million (in current prices)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 6010EP7, ECR%:0.702, EPP%:0.795, EFD/IDG%:0.516, Greens/EFA%:0.93, NI%:0.333, REG%:0.904, S&D%:0.826, The Left%:0.086, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Council Regulation No (EC) 207/2009). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an increasingly competitive environment, the growing number of trade mark applications at both national and EU levels, and the growing number of trade mark users demonstrates the crucial role of trade marks in terms of market success and commercial value. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date. In its \u2018 Small Business Act \u2019 of 2008, the Commission pledged to make the Community trademark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, in its 2008 Communication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe the Commission underlined its commitment to effective and efficient trademark protection and to a trademark system of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trademark system in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) and National Offices. Lastly, in its 2011 Intellectual Property Rights Strategy for Europe, the Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a view to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it more effective, efficient and consistent overall. The Council has also called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identified one main problem that the revised Regulation needs to address: the low level of cooperation among trade mark offices in Europe. The following options were considered to solve the problems and to achieve three corresponding objectives. \u00b7  Providing an adequate legal basis for cooperation: Option 1: no specific legal basis; Option 2: legal basis allowing optional cooperation; Option 3: legal basis obliging mandatory cooperation. \u00b7  Technical capacity building at National Offices : Option 1: each office to procure and develop the required facilities and tools; Option 2: optional access to tools; Option 3: mandatory access to tools. \u00b7  Securing long-term financing for cooperation activities : Option 1: from Member States; Option 2: from EU budget; Option 3: from OHIM budget. The impact assessment concluded that option 3 (legal basis obliging mandatory cooperation, mandatory access to tools, and financing from OHIM budget) would in all cases be proportionate and best suited to achieving the objectives pursued. LEGAL BASIS: Article 118 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main common objective of this initiative and of the parallel proposal for the recast of Directive 2008/95/EC is to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and efficient in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and legal security. As regards this proposal to revise the Regulation, the Commission is not proposing a new system, but well-targeted modernisation of existing provisions, with the main aims being: 1) Adapting the terminology in the Regulation to the Lisbon Treaty and adapting provisions to the Common Approach on decentralised agencies : throughout the Regulation, the term \u2018Community trade mark\u2019 is replaced by \u2018European trade mark\u2019. The term \u201cOffice\u201d, insofar as it refers to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, is replaced by the term \u2018Agency\u2019. 2) Streamlining procedures to apply for and register a European trade mark: \u00b7  since National Offices hardly ever receive applications for European trade marks any more, the option for filing these at National Offices should be abolished; \u00b7  with regard to the filing date, it is proposed to abolish the one-month period and to link the \u2018obligation\u2019 to pay with the filing of the application, so that applicants will have to provide evidence that they submitted or authorised their payment when they filed their application; \u00b7  current search regimes are abolished, in view of the fact that they do not provide a reliable trade mark clearance tool; \u00b7  the current one-month period between the Agency notifying the applicant of search reports and publication of the application is abolished, which will speed up the registration procedure. 3) Increasing legal certainty by clarifying provisions and removing ambiguities: \u00b7  the proposed new definition of a European trademark leaves the door open to registering matter that can be represented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees; \u00b7  the absolute grounds for refusal are fully aligned with the EU law on geographical indications; \u00b7  it is clarified that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier rights; \u00b7  in cases of both double identity and similarity, it is only the origin function which matters; \u00b7  in accordance with the rulings of the Court of Justice, it is appropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met; \u00b7  the trade mark owner may prevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC; \u00b7  it is clarified that goods may not be imported into the EU even if only the consignor is acting for commercial purposes. \u00b7  bearing in mind the outcome of the Philips/Nokia judgment, the proposal entitles right holders to stop third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing an unauthorised trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the Union, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation; Other amendments concern the following provisions: limitation of the effects of a European trademark; designation and classification of goods and services; European certification marks, and tasks of the Agency, which are defined in one new Article. 4) Establishing an appropriate framework for cooperation between OHIM and national offices to promote convergence of practices and developing common tools: the proposal contains provisions for mandatory cooperation between the Agency and Member States, and stipulates the main areas for cooperation and specific common projects of Union interest which the Agency will coordinate. It further sets up a funding mechanism enabling the Agency to finance those common projects by means of grants. 5) Aligning the framework to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 5886EP7, ECR%:0.667, EPP%:0.875, EFD/IDG%:0.419, Greens/EFA%:0.0, NI%:0.273, REG%:0.867, S&D%:0.826, The Left%:0.543, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: online platforms are key enablers of digital trade. At present, more than a million EU enterprises trade through online platforms in order to reach their customers, and it is estimated that around 60% of private consumption and 30% of public consumption of goods and services related to the total digital economy are transacted via online intermediaries. The growing intermediation of transactions through online intermediation services, fuelled by strong data-driven indirect network effects, lead to an increased dependence of such business users, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, on those services in order for them to reach consumers. The dependence of businesses on certain online services implies that the providers of such online intermediation services have a scope to engage in a number of potentially harmful trading practices which limit business users' sales through them and risk undermining their trust, notably: unexplained changes in terms and conditions without prior notice; the delisting of goods or services and the suspension of accounts without a clear statement of reasons; lack of transparency related to the ranking of goods and services and of the undertakings offering them; unclear conditions for access to, and use of, data collected by providers. Furthermore, online general search engines exhibit a dependency-enabled issue, specifically for potentially harmful ranking practices, which may affect business users. Building on extensive stakeholder consultation, this initiative contributes to the objectives of the digital single market strategy by creating a clear, transparent and stable legal environment for online B2C service providers and their business users, in order to combat market fragmentation and ensure that businesses using online intermediation services have access to redress opportunities throughout the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the optimal policy choice aims to provide legally binding transparency and redress obligations on the full range of potentially harmful trading practices identified as part of this initiative, including transparency for the issue of ranking in online general search. The Commission considers that the proposal should be capable of reversing a dampening effect on the online platform economy resulting from a lack of trust of business users amounting to at least between EUR 810 million and EUR 4 billion. CONTENT: the proposed new Regulation: lays down obligations for providers of online intermediation services and, in certain respects, online search engines to provide business users and corporate website users, respectively, with appropriate transparency and to offer them certain redress possibilities; obliges providers of online intermediation services to ensure that their terms and conditions: (i) are drafted in clear and unambiguous language; (ii) are easily available for business users; (iii) set out the objective grounds for decisions to suspend or terminate, in whole or in part, the provision of their online intermediation services to business users; establishes requirements for a statement of reasons from a provider of online intermediation services if it suspends or terminates the use by a business user of its intermediation services; establishes requirements for a description of the main parameters determining ranking of business users in search results, including a description where ranking is influenced by the business user giving direct or indirect remuneration to them, in the terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement to include a description of the access to personal data or other data which business users or consumers provide to online intermediation services or which are generated through those services, in the standard terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement for providers of online intermediation services to list in their terms and conditions one or more mediators with which the provider is willing to engage to reach an agreement out of court on a dispute, for instance where an issue has not been resolved by the internal complaint handling system; establishes a requirement for the Commission to encourage providers of online intermediation services to individually or jointly set up one or more independent mediator organisations to facilitate the settlement, out of court, of disputes that arise in the course of online intermediation services, particularly given their cross-border nature; establishes a right for judicial proceedings to be brought by representative organisations, associations or public bodies to stop or prohibit any non-compliance by providers of online intermediation services with the requirements contained in the Regulation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vote ID: 10184EP8, ECR%:0.9, EPP%:0.86, EFD/IDG%:0.854, Greens/EFA%:1.0, NI%:0.269, REG%:0.881, S&D%:0.885, The Left%:0.865, General Majority:1, Left Majority:0, Right Majority:0, Consensus:0"}]}
