LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision. CONTENT: to recall, relations between Tajikistan and the EC are currently governed by the trade and cooperation agreement signed with the former Soviet Union on 18 December 1989 (which entered into force on 1 April 1990), as endorsed by the Republic of Tajikistan in an exchange of letters on 4 February 1994. The Council adopted its negotiating directives on 5 October 1992, amending them on 10 October 2003, and the Commission formally launched the negotiations for a partnership and cooperation agreement in November 2003. After the second round of negotiations, the text of the agreement was initialed by the negotiators of the Commission and the Government of Tajikistan in Brussels on 16 December 2003. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is a mixed agreement covering some matters for which the European Communities are competent and others for which the Member States are competent. It is concluded for an initial period of ten years. The Agreement includes a clause permitting its unilateral suspension if an essential element is violated (i.e. respect for democracy, human rights and the principles of a market economy). The Agreement establishes institutional machinery for its implementation in the form of a Cooperation Council, a Cooperation Committee and a Parliamentary Committee. Pending the entry into force of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, it is proposed that the European Communities and Tajikistan conclude an interim agreement mainly concerning trade, cooperation and the institutional framework, as provided for in Article 101 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Having completed the negotiating process, the Commission now proposes that the Council approve the results of the negotiations and initiate the procedures for the signing and conclusion of this agreement. The proposed Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will help consolidate and strengthen the EU's political and economic and trade presence in Tajikistan and Central Asia in general. It also aims to promote economic growth and support sustainable development, action against poverty and stability in Tajikistan and Central Asia. In addition, it will provide a framework for future EU cooperation with Tajikistan. Though modelled on other partnership and cooperation agreements, the EU Tajikistan agreement is the first to include clauses on action against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. It will be concluded for a period of 10 years, automatically renewable from year to year thereafter. The Agreement will open the way for deeper relations in a great number of fields, based on reciprocity and partnership. The Agreement is founded on respect for the essential principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and on the promotion of sustainable development and the link between different aid instruments (the link between relief, rehabilitation and development). The proposed Agreement has three main components as well as general and institutional provisions to sustain those components: 1) Political dialogue: the EU and Tajikistan will pursue a regular political dialogue. They will in particular cooperate against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and trafficking, including the drugs trade; 2) Cooperation: the Agreement includes provisions in the area of social and economic cooperation, finance and trade, science, information society and technologies, culture, education and audio-visual, state reform and public administration, social and legislative cooperation. The Agreement also provides for commitments and cooperation in re-admission, in the control of illegal immigration, and in combating drugs and organized crime. The Agreement also provides for cooperation on democracy and human rights. A separate protocol covers mutual assistance in customs matters; 3) Trade: the Agreement also includes provisions on trade in goods and services and on trade and investment. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: This agreement has no impact on the budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the 6th Environment Action Programme, approved in 2002, recognised that pesticide use impacts greatly both on human health and on the environment. Particular effort has been given, in particular, to reducing further still the use of pesticides for plant protection purposes. The Environment Action Programme underlines the need to achieve a more sustainable use of pesticides and to reduce the risk of pesticides. In addition, the Commission Communication “Towards a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides” (see INI/2002/2277), recognises the need for detailed, harmonised and up-to-date statistics on the sale and the use of pesticides at Community level. The Commission proposed to establish relevant mandatory requirements within two years of the adoption of the Thematic Strategy. Indeed, monitoring the risks related to the use of pesticides needs appropriate indicators. The Member States, the Commission and the OECD have already conducted preliminary studies which seek to establish such indicators. The calculation of risk indicators is possible only on the basis of suitable data – such as pesticide use. Experts have, however, expressed their concerns about the accessibility, transparency, adequacy and reliability of such data. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposed Regulation, therefore, is to create a legal framework that lays down harmonised rules for the collection and dissemination of data concerning the placing on the market and use of plant protection products. The Regulation instructs the Member States: to collect data regularly (annually as regards placing on the market and every five years as regards use); on how to collect data – such as representative surveys, statistical estimation procedures on the basis of expert judgements or models, reporting obligations imposed on the distribution chain for plant protection products, reporting obligations imposed on professional users, from administrative sources or by a combination of these means; on how to transmit date to the Commission. It also entrusts the Commission with the tasks of adapting some technical aspects and defining the quality evaluation criteria and the data transmission format. The financing of actions for statistics on plant protection products will be covered by the Community statistical programme 2008-2012. The proposal draws widely on the expertise of the 'Pesticide Statistics Experts Group'. It is also based on the experience gained through 30 pilot projects conducted between 1999 and 2004 within the technical action plan for improving agricultural statistics (TAPAS) and 10 projects carried out in 2005 in the new Member States and Acceding Countries with the support of the 2002 PHARE Multi-Beneficiary Programme for Statistical Co-operation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission was amended by Council Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a new regulatory procedure with scrutiny (PRAC) for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the codecision procedure, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements. In a joint statement, the Parliament, the Council and the Commission listed a number of basic instruments that should be adapted to the amended Decision as a matter of urgency in order to incorporate the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (priority alignment). The Commission presented all the proposals regarding priority alignment in December 2006. These were examined and adopted by the Parliament and the Council. For the PRAC to be applicable to the other instruments adopted under the codecision procedure that were already in force at the time Decision 2006/512/EC came into effect, the joint statement also called for these instruments to be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures (general alignment). The Commission decided to carry out the alignment by means of proposals for 'omnibus' Regulations. The Commission adopted the first three proposals on 23 November (see COD/2007/0262 ) and 19 December 2007 (see COD/2007/0282 and COD/2007/0293 ). It adopted the last of the proposals on 11 February 2008 (see COD/2008/0032 ). On 23 September 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution with recommendations to the Commission on the alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision. In the resolution, the Parliament called on the Commission to present it with new legislative proposals to complete the general alignment. To this end, it provided the Commission with a list of 14 instruments which it deemed to require adaptation to the new Comitology Procedure but which were not covered by the Commission Communication of 23 November 2007. The Commission looked particularly closely at the 14 instruments to which its attention was drawn in the Parliament's resolution. All provisions in these basic instruments that delegate implementing powers to the Commission were carefully examined. On the basis of this examination, the Commission does not deem it necessary to present proposals for all these basic instruments. In the Commission's view, 12 of the instruments do not require adaptation to the new Comitology Procedure. However, the Commission acknowledges, with the European Parliament, that two basic instruments contain a number of provisions which do have to be adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny: · Directive 2000/15/EC amending Council Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine. · Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97. The purpose of the present proposal is to adapt these two basic instruments to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the light of the unprecedented crisis that the European Union is currently facing, it is the citizens who risk paying the highest price in terms of unemployment. In order to prevent high levels of unemployment, boost job creation and pave the way for economic renewal, sustainable recovery and growth, the European Union decided to react by proposing a vast economic recovery plan. As part of this recovery plan, the Commission presented a Communication in which it proposed the creation of a new EU microfinance facility for employment (Progress Microfinance Facility) in order to give the unemployed the chance of a new start and to open the way to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including the young. That is the purpose of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not carry out a real impact assessment for this initiative but rather an ex-ante evaluation in which it notes that Community and national efforts have to be strengthened so as to increase the supply of micro-credits for those who need it most, i.e. unemployed or vulnerable people who want to go into self-employment but do not have access to bank credits. CONTENT: the proposed Facility shall provide Community resources with a view to facilitating access to microcredit for the following target groups: persons who have lost or are at risk of losing their job and want to start their own micro-enterprise, including self-employment; disadvantaged persons, including the young, who want to start or further develop their own micro-enterprise, including self-employment; micro-enterprises in the social economy which employ persons who have lost their job or which employ disadvantaged persons, including the young. Eligible actions : the Facility shall be implemented by using the following types of actions, as appropriate: guarantees and risk-sharing instruments; equity instruments; debt instruments; support measures, such as communication activities, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation which are directly necessary for the effective and efficient implementation of this Decision and for the achievement of its objectives (the total budget for these support measures shall not exceed 1% of the budget of the Facility). Beneficiaries : the Facility shall be open to public and private bodies established in the Member States which provide microfinance to persons and micro-enterprises in the Member States. Implementation : the Decision contains provisions on the management of the Facility. The Commission shall manage the Facility in accordance with the Financial Regulation. It shall conclude agreements with international financial institutions (EIB and EIF), which shall themselves conclude written agreements with the public and private providers of microfinance (whether banks or not) throughout the EU in order to finance initiatives that fall under the framework of the Facility. Evaluation, monitoring and reporting : the Facility is subject to traditional evaluation and anti-fraud provisions. From 2011, the Commission shall present to the European Parliament and to the Council a quantitative and qualitative annual report on the activities under this Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in line with the Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, the Facility is to be established by a reallocation of the existing budget. Under the terms of that agreement, the Parliament added an additional EUR 114 million to the budget for the Progress programme thus increasing the budget to EUR 743 250 000. This additional financing was to have been applied progressively in the later years of the programme i.e. from 2009. After examining all possible options, the funding would come from a reallocation of EUR 100 million (over 4 years) from the Progress Programme to the new European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (the Progress Microfinance Facility). This EUR 100 million from the existing budget could leverage more than EUR 500 million, in a joint initiative with international financial institutions, in particular the EIB Group."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal notes that currently, Article 7(2) of the ERDF Regulation provides for the eligibility of expenditure on housing in the new Member States. The experience to-date, however, proves that the conditions of eligibility do not fully fit the needs on the ground. Under the current ERDF provisions, housing interventions can take place in the framework of urban development operations and in the form of renovation of existing houses. Therefore, support for housing interventions in rural areas or for the replacement of “houses” of a very poor quality in urban or rural areas cannot be eligible under the ERDF. The European Parliament and the Council have repeatedly asked the Commission to take action to promote inclusion of communities facing extreme deprivation and marginalisation, with particular reference to the Roma community. This proposal aims to remedy the situation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the present proposal permits the ERDF financial support for housing interventions in cases where marginalised communities living conditions are extremely poor and social exclusion is high. This could not be possible without modification of the existing regulatory framework. CONTENT: the proposal states that allocations shall be made available also for housing interventions in favour of communities currently ineligible under the ERDF, i.e. for i) housing interventions not limited to the urban areas and ii) housing interventions consisting of the replacement of houses of extremely poor quality, irrespectively of the area (“urban” or “rural”). Expenditure shall be limited to one of the following interventions: renovation of the common parts in existing multi-family housing, renovation and change of use of existing buildings owned by public authorities or non-profit operators for use as housing designated for low-income households or people with special needs. Interventions may include the replacement of existing housing by newly constructed houses. Furthermore, the amended Article 7(2) of the ERDF Regulation confers the Commission implementing powers for the definition of the criteria for the selection of areas and of the list of eligible housing interventions. The proposal notes that in order to avoid unjustified discriminations, the guiding principle of the proposed interventions should be the 2nd Basic Principle on Roma Inclusion according to which interventions focusing on Roma people as target group should not exclude other people sharing similar socio-economic circumstances. Moreover, housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities characterised by extreme deprivation are only part of a complex issue. They should be tackled in the framework of a multi-dimensional integrated approach, to be defined at national level, with strong partnerships and taking on board aspects relating to education, social affairs, integration, culture, health, employment, security etc. Hence, the aim of the proposal amending the current ERDF Regulation is to provide, in the framework of an integrated approach, acceptable housing conditions. In this context, the role of public authorities at all stages of the implementation is of an outmost importance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: on 16 July 2009, Iceland presented its application to the Council to become a member of the European Union. The General Affairs Council in its session on 27 July 2009, recalling the renewed consensus on enlargement expressed in the conclusions of the European Council of 14/15 December 2006, and particularly the principle that each applicant country is assessed on its own merits, decided to implement the procedure laid down in Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union. Accordingly, the Commission was invited to submit to the Council its opinion on Iceland's application. Pending the presentation of the Commission's opinion to the Council, Iceland can be considered as a potential candidate country. It is therefore necessary to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) in order to enable Iceland to benefit from the assistance provided under the umbrella of IPA for the potential candidate countries. The proposed amendments are as follows: the first amendment is introduced in Annex II and foresees including Iceland in the list of potential candidate countries; secondly, an amendment is introduced in Article 4. This Article stipulates that assistance under the regulation is provided in accordance with the general policy framework for pre-accession defined by the European and Accession Partnerships and taking due account of the Reports and the Strategy Paper comprised in the annual Enlargement package of the Commission. Considering that the European and Accession Partnerships have been designed particularly for the Western Balkans and Turkey to provide guidance for EU integration and harmonisation with acquis, and the fact that Iceland is integrated in the European Economic Area, it is necessary to introduce a minor amendment to Article 4, notably by adding a paragraph which specifies that support to Iceland is provided only on the basis of the Reports and Strategy Paper comprised in the annual Enlargement package of the Commission. This amendment will exclude the application of the European and Accession Partnerships to Iceland. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: not applicable."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Europe Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission recently proposed the creation of a new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion - Progress, designed to give the unemployed the chance of a new start and to open the way to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including the young, in the broader context of the Economic Recovery Plan. The aim of the present proposal is to provide adequate financial assistance for this new instrument by reallocating financial resources from the 2007-2013 Progress Programme. The proposal to reallocate part of the budget will not compromise the objectives of the Progress programme. CONTENT: in line with the Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, this proposal aims to reallocate EUR 100 million needs to be reallocated from the existing budget of the Progress Programme, set up by Decision No 1672/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, to the new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion – Progress. Decision No 1672/2006/EC should be amended accordingly and provides for EUR 643 250 000 from 2007-2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: an additional amount of EUR 114 million (current prices) was allocated to the Progress programme. The total budget for 2007-2013 was therefore increased from EUR 628 800 000 (current prices) in the Commission's initial proposal to EUR 743 250 000 (current prices). After examining all possible options, the Commission proposes to reallocate EUR 100 million from the Progress Programme to the new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion – Progress. This will also require further promoting cross-cutting across policy sections and linkages with other EU instruments, such as transnational cooperation under the European Social Fund or support for social dialogue. Lastly, it will increase the efficiency and consistency of EU action in support of EU objectives and priorities in the areas of employment and social solidarity."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, pet dogs, cats and ferrets travelling with their owner to another Member State must be accompanied by a passport, or when imported by a certificate, providing proof of a valid anti-rabies vaccination (“general regime”). As of 3 July 2011 electronic identification of dogs, cats and ferrets will be mandatory. In order to take account of the particular situation of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom with regard to rabies, Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides for a transitional period during which the entry of pet dogs and cats into those Member States is subjected to more stringent requirements. The Regulation grants a period of five years starting from the date of its entry into force, i.e. until 3 July 2008 (extended to 30 June 2010), to Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom to make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with certain additional requirements to prevent the risk of introducing rabies, echinococcus and ticks (""transitional regime""). In order to determine the regime to be applied with effect from 1 July 2010, the Commission carried out an impact assessment based on various recent consultations and on the report that was adopted on 8 October 2007 that took into account the recommendations made by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA identified that in 2005 certain Member States had a non negligible prevalence of rabies in their pet population, which is related to the rabies situation in wildlife (foxes are the main reservoir of rabies in Europe). In view of the EFSA opinions and of the Community-supported programmes, the transitional measure provided for in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should be extended until 31 December 2011. Moreover, from the opinions adopted by EFSA with regard to echinococcosis and ticks, it results that the data available did not allow EFSA to demonstrate a particular status of the five Member States applying the transitional regime with regard to certain ticks and the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis and to quantify the risk of pathogen introduction through the non-commercial movement of pet animals. For reasons of consistency, it is appropriate to extend the transitional measure provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 until 31 December 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers four policy options: Option 1 : no action - this option means that after 30 June 2010, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the UK will no longer make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to additional requirements regarding rabies, echinococcus and ticks. Option 2 : extension of the transitional regime – this option means a further temporary extension of the transitional period until the end of 2011. This option would require a Commission proposal to the European Parliament and the Council extending the transitional period for the five Member States that currently apply special rules and clarifying the regime that would apply as from 1 January 2012. Option 3 : adjustment of the current rules applicable to all Member States. Option 4 : continuation of the transitional regime on a permanent basis. Following on from the impact assessment, preference has been given to options 1 and 2, which are similar in principle. Either would entail removing, sooner or later, the unjustified disparities, discrimination and burden felt by citizens including citizens from the five Member States who are affected by additional requirements when returning from abroad. At the same time, both options would maintain a high level of safety for pet movements within and into the EU, by applying the general regime, which has proved to be effective in preventing human and pet animal cases of rabies caused by lawful movement of pets between and into Member States. However, the Commission concludes that there is a slight advantage in selecting option 2 as it lowers the public health risk. CONTENT: the overall objectives of this Regulation are to be seen in the light of the free circulation of people and the new Animal Health Strategy. The specific objectives are: to harmonise requirements to remove disproportionate obstacles to the movement of pets for non-commercial purposes across the EU or entering the EU from third countries, while properly protecting public and animal health , in particular with regard to rabies; to provide EU rules that are proportionate, avoid causing difficulties and give clear benefits in terms of clarity and simplification for travelling pet owners. The proposal foresees that special science based rules could be adopted by the Commission under the comitology procedure if a Member State demonstrates that they are necessary to effectively protect itself against the introduction and spread of disease agents that do not occur in their territory. Lastly, two new Annexes, Annex Ia and Annex Ib, the texts of which are set out in the Annex to the present Regulation, shall be inserted. Part C of Annex I, Annex Ib and parts B and C of Annex II may be amended by the Commission to take account of developments in the situation within Community territory or in third countries as regards diseases affecting the species of animals covered by this Regulation, in particular rabies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with the current Schengen acquis, a third-country national holding a national long-stay visa (""D visa"") for stays exceeding three months is allowed to stay only in the territory of the Member State which issued the visa and, pursuant to Article 18 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement, as amended by Regulation 1091/2001, is allowed to transit through the territories of the other Member States only in order to reach the State which issued the visa. Thus, according to present Community law, D visa holders are not allowed to travel to the other Member States during their stay and nor are they allowed to transit through the other States when returning to their country of origin, as this is not provided for by the Schengen Convention. The wording of the above provision of the Schengen Convention stems from the procedure generally applied at the time by the Member States whereby D visas are converted into a residence permit after arrival on the territory. On the basis of such a residence permit, third country nationals can then circulate within the Schengen area. For this reason, at the time of the conclusion of the Schengen Convention, Member States did not consider it necessary to regulate either the circulation and the return journey on the basis of a D visa, or a second transit to the Member State that had issued the D visa. Therefore, the Schengen Convention only provides the principle of equivalence between Schengen residence permits and visas applicable in the Schengen area: a residence permit issued by a Member State allows a third country national, holding the residence permit and a valid travel document, to move freely for up to three months within the territories of the other Member States during his/her stay. Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 also provides for the possibility for third country nationals in possession of a valid residence permit issued by a Member State to cross the external borders of another Member State without a visa for stays not exceeding three months. However, in practice this situation caused serious problems. More and more Member States do not replace D visas by residence permits after the entry of third-country nationals into their territory, or replace them only with considerable delays. Therefore, the Commission proposes the introduction of the principle of equivalence between long-stay and short-stay visas issued by the Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis in order to overcome the present problems encountered by third-country nationals legally staying in a Member State with a long-stay visa. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: this proposal and the parallel draft Regulation extend the principle of equivalence between a residence permit and short-stay visas to long-stay D visas. Hence a long-stay visa would have the same effects as a residence permit as regards circulation in the Schengen area. Principle : a third-country national holding a long-stay D visa issued by a Member State could travel to the other Member States for three months in any half year, under the same conditions as the holder of a residence permit. The rules regarding the issuance of long-stay visas remain unchanged as it was the case with the rules on the issuance of residence permits when the principle of equivalence between a residence permit and a short-stay visa was introduced. This would restore the basic philosophy underlying the Schengen area without internal borders, i.e. that a person can travel around in the Schengen area for short stays for three months in any half year with the document on the basis of which he is legally present in a Member State. Legal aspects : due to the conflicting decision making procedures attached to the different legal basis, the Commission had to draw up two separate proposals. Technically, the proposed Regulations will amend: Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code), on the entry conditions for third-country nationals and Article 21 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement – present proposal for a Regulation based on Article 62 (2)(a) and (3) of the TEC and shall be adopted in accordance with the co-decision procedure; Articles 18 and 25 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 (between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their borders) – proposed parallel Regulation based on Articles 63 (3)(a) of the TEC and shall be adopted at unanimity in the Council after consulting the European Parliament. It should be noted that contrary to the proposed parallel Regulation, this proposed Regulation does not make any changes to important provisions of the Schengen Convention as regards the security aspects (obligation to consult the SIS and the other Member States in case of an alert would also apply when Member States consider the issuance of a long-stay visa to a third-country national or when Member States discover an alert which has been issued to a third-country national who holds a valid long-stay visa). Territorial provisions : Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein are associated with the implementation of this draft Regulation in accordance with bilateral agreements concluded with the EU on the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom and Ireland is not participating in the adoption and the implementation of this text in accordance with the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union. Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. However, it may decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement this Regulation in its national law. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Council of 8‑9 March 2007 underlined that reducing administrative burden is important for boosting the European economy, especially considering the potential benefits this can bring for SMEs. In this context, it called on the Commission to identify new ""fast track"" legislative proposals in order to reduce administrative burdens. Accounting and auditing have been identified as key areas for reducing administrative burden for European companies. Furthermore, the European Parliament encourages the Commission to continue its activities with regard to the simplification of company law, accounting and auditing, in particular the 4th and 7th Company Law Directives, and explicitly calls on the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal that allows Member States to exempt local and regional undertakings from the scope of the Accounting Directives. The 4th Company Law Directive was adopted in 1978 in order to create a harmonised set of requirements for the external reporting of all limited liability companies in the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers six options: Option 0 : No change to the Directives; Option 1 : Encourage a full use of existing options in the Accounting Directives; Option 2 : Obligatory exemption of micro entities from the scope of the Directives; Option 3 : Member State option to exempt micro entities from the scope of the Directives; Option 4 : Introduction of a simplified accounting regime for micro entities; Option 5 : Amendments to the Accounting Directive without introducing the micro category. The Commission considers that the option that provides the biggest burden reduction is Option 3 (option to exempt micro entities). This option can also be implemented within the shortest timeframe. CONTENT: the Commission suggests establishing an option for Member States of removing the micro-entities from the scope of the 4th Company Law Directive and, by doing so, relieving them from the requirement to draw up annual accounts. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to add a new Article 1a to the 4th Company Law Directive extending the discretion of Member States to relieve the micro-entities from the scope of the 4th Company Law Directive. According to that Article, Member States may provide for an exemption from the obligations under the Directive for companies which on their balance sheet dates do not exceed the limits of two of the three following criteria: balance sheet total: EUR 500 000; net turnover: EUR 1 000 000; average number of employees during the financial year: 10. However, it needs to be recalled, that companies, including micro entities, keep records of sales and transactions for their own management purposes and for tax reporting. The Directive will enable Member States to align the financial reporting to such other reporting needs to avoid unnecessary administrative burden. Micro entities can on a voluntary basis still draw up annual accounts, have them audited and send them to the national register. These changes should lead to reduced administrative burden while safeguarding adequate protection and information to stakeholders and enable alignment of the micro-entities' reporting requirements with the real needs of users and preparers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the transport of pressure equipment, e. g. tanks, receptacles, drums and cylinders, constitutes an important area of the transport of dangerous goods. Council Directive 1999/36/EC ensures a high level of transport safety for transportable pressure equipment whilst allowing their free movement and use on the European transport market through common norms for their design, construction and subsequent checks. For the technical requirements, the existing Directive 1999/36/EC refers to Directives 94/55/EC and 96/49/EC, which have been repealed by Directive 2008/68/EC with effect of 1 July 2009 . Directive 2008/68/EC incorporates into Community legislation the requirements contained in international agreements on transport of dangerous goods by road (ADR: European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road), rail (RID: Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail) and inland waterways (ADN: European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Inland Waterways). As a result of these recent legislative developments, which in turn reflect technical developments over the last 10 years, the EU rules have become complicated and difficult to understand. In addition, on a number of technical issues the interplay between European and international rules will lead to certain contradictions which would make their application even more difficult. The second key objective of the proposal concerns the use of the equipment itself for transport operations in the internal market. In view of these facts it is necessary to revise Directive 1999/36/EC. CONTENT: this proposed Directive sets out detailed rules concerning transportable pressure equipment to enhance safety and ensure free movement of such equipment within the Community. It defines a number of terms regarding transportable pressure equipment, actors and measures guaranteeing the safety of the equipment and its use on the internal market. The need for simplification and clarification is the main reason for the Commission to propose this revision. Neither the scope, nor the measures of the existing Directive will be changed in any substantial way. This also results in minimal budgetary and other economic impacts on administration and operators. As for the technical provisions, a central simplification objective is to remove conflicting issues between the existing Directive on Transportable Pressure Equipment and international rules on the transport of dangerous goods, in particular since these rules have already been extended to Community legislation through Directive 2008/68/EC. The proposal simplifies existing provisions, in particular those relating to the modules on conformity assessment procedures. This dimension will be substantially streamlined and simplified in the proposal, which makes reference to the relevant international agreements. The technical rules and administrative procedures are more consistently presented in one source, i.e. in the international agreements. The proposed Directive focuses on those issues that can be treated satisfactorily only through European legislation. As for making the equipment required for transport operations available on the market, the Community has recently adopted rules relating to the marketing of products on the EU single market (""New Legislative Framework"") which should, wherever possible, be applied across all industrial sectors (see COD/2007/0029 and COD/2007/0030). By incorporating these rules into the proposal for the specific sector of transportable pressure equipment the Commission will help to simplify the rules by not creating different, sector-specific rules where the general rules would serve the purpose. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: given that the provisions of the existing Directive on transportable pressure equipment are already implemented, any further budgetary implications will be minor."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: at present, systems for the recovery of aviation security costs are regulated at national level and are not always transparent to the users. Users are not systematically consulted at all EU airports before charges are determined or before a charging system is modified. This proposal sets common principles for the levying of security charges at Community airports and applies to any airport located in a territory subject to the provisions of the Treaty. However, it does not apply to the charges collected for the remuneration of en-route and terminal air navigation services in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1794/2006, or to the charges collected for the remuneration of ground-handling services referred to in the Annex to Council Directive 96/67/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers four policy options: Option 1 : No EU action; Option 2 : Self-regulation. Option 3 : EU Directive on non-discrimination, transparency, cost-relatedness and possibility to appeal; Option 4 : Full state funding of airport security. Options 1 and 2 do not attain the objectives, while options 3 and 4 effectively address the concerns of discriminatory and excessive security charges. Option 4, however, discourages more efficient aviation security services because there are no incentives for the security providers to control costs. The increased administrative burden of option 3 is negligible because the same authority as established by the Directive on airport charges can be used. Consequently, option 3 offers the most efficient overall solution. CONTENT: the proposal defines a number of basic principles to be respected by airport operators when they determine their security charges. These are: Non-discrimination : aviation security charging systems should not discriminate between carriers or passengers. Consultation and remedy : the airport managing body and the air carriers serving the airport, or their representative organisations, must engage in a dialogue on the security charging system applicable at an airport not only when such system is modified but also when the levels of the security charges are being established. The aim of this requirement is that the two parties exchange views on a regular basis on the levels of the charges, as well as on all factors and regulatory requirements that have an influence on the determination of those charges. Transparency : the proposed Directive contains no provisions on the methods for calculating security charges that should be applied in each Member State. While the Commission acknowledges the wide diversity of airport regulation in the various Member States, a reasonable amount of information must nevertheless be provided by the operator to the air carriers so as to make the consultation process between airports and air carriers meaningful. To this end, the Directive establishes which information should be provided on a regular basis by the airport managing body. Air carriers should, in turn, give information as to their traffic forecasts, their intended fleet use and their present and future specific requirements at the airport, so as to allow the airport managing body to employ their capital and dedicate their capacity in an optimal manner. Air carriers should also have the right to be informed about security measures that are more stringent than required by Community law. Cost-relatedness : revenues from security charges shall only be used to meet security costs. Supervisory authority : a draft Directive that contains the principles to be respected by the main partners in the air transport industry i.e. the airports and air carriers, which have diverging interests, needs to be properly applied and adhered to at the level of the Member States. An authority to be established in each Member State that is in charge of ensuring the correct application of the Directive would be an appropriate guarantee that its provisions are respected. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the codification of Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network has been undertaken by the Commission and a relevant proposal has been submitted to the legislative authority . The new Decision was to supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Meanwhile, it was necessary to amend Annex I to Decision No 1692/96/EC of to take account of the enlargement of the European Community to 27 Member States. It is therefore appropriate to transform the codification of Decision No 1692/96/EC into a recast in order to incorporate the amendments necessary for the adjustment to the enlargement. The necessary amendments consist of adding the maps relating to the 10 Member States listed in the 2003 Act of Accession in Annex I to the Decision to the existing maps relating to the 15 countries that were Members of the European Union before the enlargement of 1 May 2004. This amendment was provided for in Article 1(15) of Decision No 884/2004/EC and it must be made. In accordance with Decision No 884/2004/EC, the target date for the trans-European network outline plan for the 10 Member States in the 2003 Act of Accession is 2020 rather than 2010. In the interests of clarity, it is proposed to replace Annex I to the codified text with a new Annex I which would include the maps concerning the 27 Member States of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in the context of the current crisis, ensuring a smooth implementation of Cohesion programmes is of particular relevance as they represent the most powerful and relevant lever for assisting the real economy. With total financial resources of EUR 347 billion for the period 2007‑2013, Cohesion policy provides a powerful support for both budgetary stability and public investment in the Member States and the regions of the European Union. Experience shows that more effort is needed to facilitate the management of the Community funding in order to speed up the flow of the funding to the beneficiaries that are most affected by the economic downturn. The December 2008 European Council agreed on a European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), which envisages the initiation of priority action to enable European economies to adjust more rapidly to current challenges. Moreover, the Commission has endeavoured to contribute to the debate currently taking place within the Union and with its international partners on how best to react to the current financial crisis and to its socio-economic consequences. In particular, in the framework of its recovery package, the Commission proposed a number of regulatory changes to simplify the implementation rules for Cohesion Policy and to increase the pre-financing (advance payments) to ERDF and ESF programmes. The additional advance payments have provided an immediate cash injection of EUR 6.25 billion in 2009 to pre-finance investment, within the financial envelope agreed for each Member State for the period 2007‑2013. This amendment brings the total of advance payments in 2009 to EUR 11.25 billion. The Commission proposal was adopted by the Council in May 2009 and all advance payments now have been paid to Member States. Moreover, in June 2009 the Commission presented a Communication on ""A Shared Commitment for Employment"" (COM(2009)0257) in which it proposed additional measures to strengthen the creation of jobs and to counter the effects of the crisis on employment. Therefore, this proposal includes further elements of simplification, with the overall objective of accelerating co-financed investments in Member States and regions and increasing the impact of the funding on the economy as a whole. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal completes a series of regulatory and non‑regulatory adjustments which all seek to stimulate the implementation of cohesion programmes on the ground. The proposal to provide Member States in the case of operational programmes co-financed by the ESF an option to reimburse interim payment claims at 100% for a limited period (up to the end of 2010) will ensure that all certified expenditure of 2009 and 2010 can be paid back without creating a gap in national budgets. Further simplification and clarification of rules governing cohesion policy will undeniably have a positive impact on the pace of programme implementation, particularly by providing national, regional and local authorities clearer and less bureaucratic rules that will allow more flexibility to adapt the programmes to the new challenges. CONTENT: the new measures presented by the Commission aim to simplify certain rules governing cohesion policy. The main changes are as follows: in 2009 and 2010, as part of its 'anti-crisis' measures, the Commission may at the request of the Member States reimburse 100% of the public costs declared by the Member States for projects financed by the ESF. Specifically, Member States will not be obliged to provide national co‑financing, thus speeding up the implementation of projects to support employment. This option does not call into question the distribution of the Funds between the Member States, nor the total budget for the Funds, nor the obligation for Member States to provide subsequent co‑financing; the Commission proposes establishing a single category of 'major project'. Previously, the Commission's approval was required for projects where the total cost exceeded EUR 25 million for the environment and EUR 50 million for other sectors. The threshold for approval is now set at EUR 50 million for all areas. Given the Community importance of the investments in environment as such, the Commission will ask Member States: (i) to ensure an appropriate monitoring of all the investments, including those below the threshold provided in the Regulation; and (ii) to inform the Commission about the implementation progress in the annual reports on operational programmes. Another modification consists of creating the possibility that a single major project is co-financed by more than one programme. This is of particular relevance for projects of nation-wide scope or Community importance, which straddle several regions, and which in the absence of this possibility would have to be artificially separated in multiple projects; the rules relating to 'revenue-generating' projects (for example, toll motorways or projects involving the leasing or sale of land) are also simplified in order to reduce the administrative burdens on the Member States. The proposed modifications intend to simplify the monitoring of revenues and to align this with the overall life-cycle of programmes. Therefore, the duration of the provisions on monitoring revenue is now limited to the date of submission of the closure documents of a programme; Cohesion Policy programmes may be simplified by Member States to take account of the new realities. In addition, certain provisions concerning the obligation to maintain investments over a five-year period will not apply to undertakings which go bankrupt; a proposed modification intends to clarify that in the context of advance payments on State aids admissible guarantees include guarantees by banks or other financial institutions, but also a facility provided for this purpose by public institutions and the Member States themselves; investments in sectors linked to energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies in housing will be encouraged, given their considerable potential to provide growth and jobs; the Commission proposes a modification aimed at increasing flexibility with regard to the rules on decommitment . For example, grants for a major project will in principle be protected as soon as the Member State submits the project to the Commission. Grants are currently only protected once the Commission has approved the project; the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will be able to support the renovation or construction of housing for communities faced with social exclusion, particularly Roma, in both rural and urban areas. Previously, the construction of housing was ineligible under the ERDF and only housing in urban areas was eligible for renovation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of ESF financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007‑2013. Where Member States decide to make use of the option to request 100% reimbursements during 2009 and 2010 there will be an impact on payment appropriations. The analysis of the Member States' payment forecasts and the payment appropriations available in the budget for 2009 and the Draft Budget for 2010 show that the maximum additional payment appropriations to be paid under the 100% reimbursement option in 2009 and 2010 for the ESF programmes would represent approximately EUR 6.6 billion. This will be compensated by a reduced need for payment appropriations later in the programming period. The Commission will set up a monitoring tool to supervise closely the consumption of the additional credits for the European Social Fund. For the payment claims submitted as of 1 January 2011, the regular co‑financing rate agreed in the programme decision will apply. The Commission believes that the proposed measures to simplify the implementation may significantly increase the pace of expenditure on the ground and consequently accelerate the submission of interim payments to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the European Refugee Fund (ERF) was set up by Decision No 573/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 as part of the General programme ""Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows"". This proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, amending the Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 (ERF III), and the Communication of the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the establishment of a Joint EU Resettlement Programme are part of the European Union's efforts to establish a Joint EU Resettlement Programme. They are a response to the requests by the Council to come forward with a proposal for the establishment of a Joint EU Resettlement Programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examines 3 different options and 2 sub-options as well as their respective effects. These can be summarised as follows: Option 1: maintenance of status quo : Option 2: medium option : u nder this option it is envisaged to develop further structured political cooperation through the establishment of a political framework and to underpin it via the financial component. It is foreseen that a political framework will be created which would set political and strategic priorities with respect to resettlement. Under this option practical cooperation will also be developed by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The following measures are also provided: (i) setting of common EU annual priorities with respect to resettlement, both with respect to nationalities and specific categories of refugees to be resettled; (ii) Member States would receive extra financial assistance under the ERF III, if they resettle according to these common EU annual priorities; (iii) ensuring an integrated approach between resettlement, external asylum policies and EU external policies as a whole. Within the 2nd option, two sub-options are identified . The difference between these sub-options relate only to the mechanism which is foreseen for the political framework. Sub-option 2A provides for the establishment of a new Committee on resettlement under Comitology rules. Sub-option 2B provides for the use of existing structures. Option 3: maximum option : u nder this option it is considered that a fully developed EU wide resettlement scheme will be established. Resettlement would be carried out jointly in terms of priority setting and also in terms of implementation. However, this option is considered to be very ambitious and has been abandoned due to its lack of feasibility at the current stage of the Union’s policy on this issue. Conclusion : sub-option 2B is preferred option on grounds of political feasibility and proportionality. There is a strong preference among a majority of Member States to build on existing consultation and decision making mechanisms. The current political situation is positive towards resettlement but reluctant to create any new formal structure, because of the bureaucratic burden this might entail and the fear that Member States' freedom to decide on priorities themselves would be reduced. From the perspective of proportionality the use of existing structures is considered preferable, if this is as effective in reaching the objectives and if it is expected to have the same impacts. CONTENT: the proposed measures seek to amend the Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 in order to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of those categories of persons which are annually identified as common EU resettlement priorities for the following year. Annual resettlement priorities : the identification of these priorities will be done on the basis of an indicative forecast of resettlement needs which will be provided by UNHCR in spring (mid-March) each year and in close consultation with the resettlement experts of Member States, UNHCR and other stakeholders. For this purpose an annual meeting will be organized in which these experts participate. On the basis of the outcomes of the meeting, the Commission will draft a proposal for a Decision identifying the common EU resettlement priorities, and will submit it for consultation to the management committee of the General Programme ""Solidarity and management of migratory flows' including the ERF III. Within 20 calendar days following the adoption of the Commission Decision on common EU resettlement priorities, Member States will provide the Commission with an estimate of the number of persons whom they will resettle in the course of the following calendar year according to these common EU annual priorities. These annual priorities may relate to geographic regions, nationalities or specific categories of refugees to be resettled. Additional financial assistance for a resettled refugee : on the basis of these pledges, Member State will receive, as an additional financial assistance, a fixed amount of EUR 4000 for each effectively resettled refugee during a respective calendar year who will fall under one of the specific categories which will be defined annually as common EU annual priorities by the Decision of the Commission. Member States will receive this fixed amount per refugee only once in case such refugee would fall under more than one of the specific categories. Timetable : the proposal provides for the setting up of a timetable as regards: the deadline for the submission of the pledging, necessary for the calculation of annual allocations between Member States; the deadline for the submission of annual programmes by Member States to the Commission; the deadline for the adoption of financing decisions by the Commission. In comparison to the deadlines set up in the current legal base, new deadlines are postponed due to the new procedure for the adoption of the common EU annual priorities for resettlement which will precede the calculation of annual allocations between Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal complies with the appropriations and programming of the General programme ""Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows"" until 2013. Furthermore, it does not alter the general objectives of the ERF and its financial programming until 2013. Only a very limited additional costs are foreseen with respect to administrative expenses (a total of EUR 158 000 for the period 2010-2013)."

The purpose is to enhance the transparency of the process of adding new fibres to the list of harmonised fibre names and introduce more flexibility to adapt legislation in order to keep up with the technological developments expected in the textiles industry.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission carried out an impact assessment of the various policy options, which led to the following conclusions: (i) the inclusion of guidance on the contents of the application file and the recognition of laboratories in assisting companies in compiling the file could bring significant time savings for both industry and public authorities; (ii) the greatest benefits for industry would arise from reducing the time taken between an application for a new fibre name being submitted and the ability to place the fibre on the market with the new name; (iii) Member States benefit from replacing the Directives with a Regulation, because they would no longer need to transpose the amendments into national legislation; (iv) consumers would benefit from knowing that fibres meet specified characteristics.  CONTENT: the proposed revision is of limited scope. It does not aim to extend EU legislation to other labelling requirements beyond the fibre composition and the harmonisation of textile fibre names covered by the existing Directives. The main changes to the existing legislation can be summarised as follows: Facilitating the legislative process to adapt legislation to technical progress: this involves transforming Directive 96/74/EC into a Regulation, and repealing Directives 96/73/EC and 73/44/EEC. Given their detailed technical content, the adaptation of uniform methods is better addressed in the form of annexes to the main Regulation. The proposed Regulation includes an Annex VIII, laying down uniform methods used for official tests. Shortening the time between the submission of an application and the adoption of the new fibre name: i n order to allow fibre manufacturers, fibre users and consumers to benefit faster from the use of novel fibres and innovative products, new fibre names should be adopted in EU legislation more rapidly. In addition to the time gained with the changing of Directive 96/74/EC into a Regulation, the time necessary for the technical examination of requests for new fibre names may be reduced if application files submitted by manufacturers are more correct and complete with respect to the requirements they need to fulfil. The proposal introduces the procedure to be followed by a manufacturer to request the addition of a new fibre name to the technical annexes of the Regulation. The manufacturer needs to submit an application file to the Commission, taking into consideration the minimum requirements set out in Annex II. The Commission will present a report after 5 years, which will focus on assessing the experience obtained with the applications for new fibre names received in that period and it will examine if further gains on time may be obtained from a revision of proposed procedures."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union. The development in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation which occurred in the meantime require the amendment of some of its provisions. The main amendments proposed are as follows : Sugar: following the reform of the common organisation of the market of sugar, incorporated in the single CMO by Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, it is proposed that Article 5 be updated so that it reflects these new provisions and allows the Azores to integrate raw cane sugar in its forecast supply balance. In previous marketing years, the sugar beet production in the Azores was not sufficient to allow its sugar industry to fulfil their allocated quota and no significant quantities of raw beet sugar were available on the market. This amendment will improve their situation by allowing them to import raw cane sugar (within the limit of the forecast supply balance). Milk-based preparations : Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 provides for a transitional period during which the Canary Islands may continue to receive supplies of determined quantities of milk-based preparations falling within CN codes 1901 90 99 and 2106 90 92 intended for industrial processing. This transitional period expires on 31 December 2009. The product falling within CN code 1901 90 99 – skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat – is a traditional product for the local consumers, including the most deprived, and has been sold in the Canary Islands during the last 40 years. The supply of this product has generated a specific local industry ensuring employment and added value. In the current situation of economic crisis it is proposed to maintain the supply of this specific product and to extend the transitional period set by the Regulation to 31 December 2013. In the light of the experience gained by the Commission, and to ensure that the Community support programmes are implemented effectively and appropriately, it is necessary to remove references in that Regulation to checks and administrative penalties. However, such national measures will continue to be communicated to the Commission in accordance with the Regulation. Wine: following the wine reform of 2008 and the recent integration of the wine CMO into the single CMO, Article 18 needs to be updated to reflect the new provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 491/2009. French overseas department of Reunion : despite the recent development of the local milk production in Reunion, the current need for drinking milk consumption on the island is not sufficiently covered. Moreover, the remoteness and insularity of this region do not allow other sources of raw milk. Consequently, it is proposed that the authorisation to produce reconstituted UHT milk from milk powder of Community origin, granted to Madeira by the first subparagraph of Article 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006, should be extended to the French overseas department of Reunion. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : these programs have a high level of execution. As the proposed modifications to Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 do not change the annual ceiling amounts for the financing of the specific supply arrangements and of the measures in favour of local production, there is no budgetary impact.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: over the past 50 years organ transplantation has become an established worldwide practice, bringing immense benefits to hundreds of thousands of patients. Organ transplantation is now the most cost-effective treatment for end-stage renal failure, while for end-stage failure of organs such as the liver, lung and heart it is the only available treatment. The shortage of organs is a major factor affecting transplantation programmes. Nearly 56 000 patients are now on waiting lists in the EU. Mortality rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15 to 30%. Donation rates and availability of organs varies considerably across Europe with achievable good practice delivering far greater benefits in some Member States than in others. On 31 May 2007, the Commission adopted a Communication on organ donation and transplantation based on that analysis. This Communication proposes what activities the EU should undertake in the field of organ transplantation. In December 2007, the Council adopted conclusions on organ donation and transplantation which recognised the importance of having high standards with respect to the quality and safety of organs for transplantation, so as to ensure a high level of protection for patients throughout Europe. The Council called on the Commission to consult the Member States, and continue its examination of the need for an EU framework on quality and safety for human organs. The European Parliament resolution adopted on 22 April 2008 recognised that it is vitally important to improve the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation to reduce transplant risks. It invited the Commission to present a proposal for a directive stipulating requirements to ensure the quality and safety of organ donation across the EU. CONTENT: this proposal for a Directive covers human organs, that are used for transplantation, during all the phases of the process – donation, procurement, testing, preservation, transport and use – and aims to ensure their quality and safety and hence a high level of health protection. Organs that are transplanted into the human body in clinical trials should comply with the quality and safety standards laid down in this Directive. The added value of the Directive: Ensuring quality and safety for patients at EU level : this Directive sets out the basic quality and safety requirements needed in every transplant system. More specifically, the proposal: provides for the creation or designation of a competent national authority in each Member State which will ensure compliance with the requirements of the Directive; establishes a system for the authorisation of programmes of organ procurement and transplantation based on common quality and safety criteria. This system would provide a complete list of authorised centres throughout the European Union, accessible to the public and professionals alike; establishes common quality and safety standards for the processes of evaluating donors and human organs, thus ensuring the health of recipients; proposes the introduction of national quality programmes to ensure continuous monitoring of performance and improvement and learning; ensures that Member States put in place organ traceability systems. The Commission will adopt procedures for guaranteeing full traceability of organs exchanged between Member States; includes measures to capture serious adverse events related to the procurement, testing and transport of organs, as well as any serious adverse reactions observed during or after transplantation which may be connected to the procurement, testing and transport of the organ in the European Union. The Commission will adopt procedures for ensuring interoperability between the reporting systems on adverse events and reactions. Ensuring the protection of donors : the proposed Directive contains a number of measures to protect living donors. These include correct evaluation of the health of the donor and comprehensive information about the risks prior to donation, the introduction of registers for living donors to follow up their health and measures to ensure the altruistic and voluntary donation of organs by living donors. Facilitating cooperation between Member States and cross-border exchanges : the Directive will: i) put in place the quality and safety conditions needed to facilitate cross-border exchanges; ii) standardise the collection of the relevant information on the characteristics of the organ needed to make a proper risk assessment; iii) establish a mechanism for transmission of the information; iv) provide for the necessary mechanisms to be put in place for cross-border exchanges of organs to ensure traceability of the organ and pre-empt serious adverse reporting."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council CONTENT: the EU has provided financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) from 1989. For the period 2005 to 2006 EUR 15 million was committed from the Community budget for each of the years 2005 and 2006 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 on Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland. That Regulation expired on 31 December 2006 and was replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 1968/2006 concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010). The regulation was adopted, like all previous regulations, on the basis of Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The European Parliament considered that the regulation should have been adopted under Article 159§3 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Article 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) and launched an action for annulment before the Court of Justice. The Court passed down its judgement on 3 September 2009 and ruled that both Articles 159§3 and 308 should be used as the legal basis and therefore annulled Council Regulation (EC) No 1968/2006 and asked the institutions to adopt a replacement regulation with a dual legal basis. In complying with the Court's ruling the European Commission is presenting a new proposal for a Regulation. In comparison with the annulled regulation the proposal for a new regulation reflects in the recitals the dual legal basis. All articles remain the same but Article 12 (on entry into force) provides for the retroactive application of Article 6 (on closure of the Fund) since in the annulled regulation the said article was providing for a closure strategy to be submitted to the Commission by June 2008. The closure strategy in question has indeed been submitted to the Commission and it has been approved. Legal Basis : Article 175 and Article 352 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal provides for EU contributions of EUR 15 million per year to the IFI for a period of 4 years from 2007 - 2010. The proposed new period will therefore end in 2010, which would coincide with the last year the Fund will be seeking financial contributions from the donors."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Baltic Sea ecosystem is seriously impacted by many natural and human-induced pressures. The sea and coasts are particularly affected by combined and increasing negative impacts from pollution, eutrophication, climate change, acidification, invasive alien species, overexploitation of living resources and loss of biodiversity. Although many research activities are taking place in the Baltic Sea region, these efforts remain, to a large degree, uncoordinated and lack a jointly agreed regional action plan. Given the limited research possibilities available at national, regional or local level to individually meet the complex environmental challenges of the Baltic Sea region as a whole, action at Community level in the Baltic Sea region is urgently called for. To respond to this, the Commission is presenting this proposal on the participation of the Community in a joint research and development programme for the Baltic (BONUS-169) to be undertaken by several Member States. By bringing together all 8 EU Baltic Sea Member States, this initiative aims to achieve sustainable coordination and cooperation among their research policies and scientific communities in tackling common European challenges and thus to make a significant contribution to the structuring of the European Research Area (ERA) in the Baltic Sea Region by removing barriers between nationally funded research programmes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three policy options have been considered for meeting the general and specific objectives of the initiative. These are: Policy option 1: continuation of policies so far developed under FP 7 (“business as usual”); Policy option 2: recourse to regionally-oriented trans-thematic call(s) under the Framework Programme; Policy option 3: recourse to Article 169 with three alternative approaches (A, B and C) varying in the extent and depth of the strategic orientation and the stakeholder involvement in the streamlining and implementation of the calls for proposals Policy option 3 through approach A  – recourse to Article 169 with a focus limited to marine research and with the immediate launching of science-driven calls for proposals, Policy option 3 through approach B  – recourse to Article 169 with a focus broadened to include the Baltic Sea drainage basin and with a strategic vision and roadmap to be developed prior to the start of the initiative and Commission proposal, Policy option 3 through approach C – recourse to Article 169 with a focus broadened to include the Baltic Sea drainage basin and with a strategic vision and roadmap developed during the first phase of the initiative. Policy option 3 through approach C is the preferred option since it can effectively address the shortcomings identified above by achieving long-lasting and durable integration at Member State, institutional and research community level. The Community contribution would ensure that truly European interest would be reflected in the working programme of the initiative, building upon, but not being limited by, activities addressed at purely national level. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to establish the participation of the Community in a Joint Baltic Sea Research Programme (BONUS-169) undertaken by all eight EU Baltic Sea Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) in support of the Baltic Sea region’s sustainable development. There will be scope for participation of the Russian Federation in the Joint Research Programme provided that the necessary legal requirements are met. BONUS-169 will provide scientific outputs to facilitate the implementation of ecosystem-based management in the Baltic Sea region and support the development and implementation of 'fit-for-purpose' ecosystem-based regulations, policies and management practices aimed at safeguarding the sustainable use of the ecosystem’s goods and services. BONUS-169 will integrate the national research programmes and activities of the 8 Baltic Sea States into a single joint research programme and support, in particular, the research and environmental objectives of the Baltic Sea Strategy (see COM(2009)0248), the Marine and Maritime Strategy and the Water Framework Directive. In order to reach its objectives, BONUS-169 will be implemented in two distinct phases: an initial strategic phase , lasting two years, during which appropriate consultation platforms for active stakeholder involvement will be set-up, a strategic research agenda prepared, and precise implementation modalities will be further broadened and developed; an implementation phase , of minimum 5 years, during which a minimum of three joint calls will be launched in view of funding strategically targeted BONUS-169 projects specifically addressing the objectives of the initiative. Since the future success of BONUS-169 will depend to a large extent upon the achievement of the objectives set out for the strategic phase, the Commission will evaluate the maturity and readiness of the initiative and, provided that the results of the evaluation of are positive, the Commission and the BONUS EEIG shall conclude the implementation agreement. The participating states have agreed that the Baltic Organisations Network for Funding Science, BONUS EEIG, established in Helsinki, Finland, will be the dedicated BONUS-169 implementation structure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary implications of this horizontal proposal are already mentioned in the legal basis of FP7 as well as in the ""Cooperation"" Specific Programme of FP7. The agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the dedicated implementation structure shall ensure that the financial interests of the Community are protected. The Community shall make a financial contribution of up to EUR 50 million for all the duration of BONUS-169 shall match the contribution of the participating states, bringing the total expected budget for the initiative to EUR 100 million. The strategic phase will be implemented by a grant according to the rules set out in this Decision and on Regulation (EC) no 1906/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in actions under the Seventh Framework Programme and for the dissemination of research results (2007-2013). For 2010, the contribution from DG RTD for the strategic phase will amount to EUR 1.25 million (the participating states have to contribute an equivalent amount). The implementation phase will be implemented by indirect centralised management, according to the provisions of Art. 54(2) (c) of the Financial Regulation. According to the Financial Regulation, the Commission will first obtain evidence of the existence and proper operation of, inter-alia, grant-award procedures, an internal control system, an adequate accounting system within the entity to which it entrusts implementation, and an independent external audit."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to reflect the fact that the Galileo Joint Undertaking would cease activities on 31 December 2006, Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 as amended established the European GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Supervisory Authority. The Authority’s original role was defined in order to meet the requirements of the system provided for at that time for the concession for the management and financing of the Galileo programme’s deployment and operational phases. This system was discontinued in 2007, and responsibility for the management and financing of the deployment phase of the programme will no longer lie with the private sector. Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, which entered into force on 25 July 2008, defines the new framework for the public governance and financing of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. It sets out the principle of the strict division of responsibilities between the European Community, represented by the Commission, the Authority and the European Space Agency, granting the Commission responsibility for the management of the programmes and setting out precisely the tasks given at that time to the Authority. It also provides that the Authority will accomplish such tasks entrusted to it whilst respecting the Commission’s role as manager of the programmes and in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission. Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 therefore implicitly and substantially amended Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004. It is now important to bring certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 into line with those of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 for the following reasons: the current situation, characterised by the coexistence of two texts which contradict each other in places, is unsatisfactory from a legal point of view; Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 stipulates that the Commission is to manage all questions relating to the security of the systems, but also makes the Supervisory Authority responsible for ensuring security accreditation. The precise role of the Authority in this regard therefore needs to be quickly clarified;  although Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 amended the Supervisory Authority’s responsibilities, it had no impact on its internal organisation, and the Commission’s influence in this area continues to be very limited. It is necessary to make changes to increase the Commission’s influence within the Authority’s internal organisation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the only logical option is to bring the text of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 into line with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 638/2008. Leaving the text of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 unchanged would not be satisfactory from a legal point of view, would cause major security problems and would not ensure the good governance of these programmes.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: GMES is an Earth observation initiative led by the EU, which has decided to develop its own operational Earth observation capacity in order to reflect its growing responsibility in European and world affairs. Over the last thirty years, the EU, the European Space Agency (ESA) and their Member States have made substantial R&D efforts in the field of Earth observation, with a view to developing infrastructure and pre-operational Earth observation services. However, with the exception of the field of operational meteorology, the data provided by the existing services either do not cover all the parameters needed by policy-makers or are not provided on a continuous basis. In other words, many of the existing Earth observation services in Europe are unreliable due to infrastructure gaps and lack of guarantees on their availability in the long term. GMES was conceived to ensure operational Earth observation in environmental and security domains beyond operational meteorology. It comprises both development activities and an operational phase. Following the Commission Communication entitled “Global Monitoring for Environment and Security: From Concept to Reality” (see COM(2008)0748 ) and the orientations of the Third Space Council, implementation of GMES operations is following a phased approach, based on clearly identified priorities, starting with development of three fast-track services on emergency response, land monitoring and marine services. Establishing such a system marks a strategic choice, with a lasting impact on the further political, economic, social and scientific development of the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the baseline (“Do nothing”) scenario, the Impact Assessment report analyses three options for implementation of GMES initial operations: Open method of coordination only; Regulatory intervention; Community financing. The Impact Assessment demonstrates that Community financing is regarded the best option, as it is likely to be more cost-effective and would offer value for money and give the downstream sector a sustainable basis on which to develop customised services. CONTENT : the objective of this proposal is to establish a legal basis for the GMES programme and EC funding of GMES initial operations (2011–2013), in order to: enable the provision of emergency response services (including emergency maps and reference maps) to various emergency response actors at Community and Member State level, as well as the key United Nations agencies, in the areas of civil protection, humanitarian aid and crisis management between 2011 and 2013, on a 24/7 basis, so that they can respond to emergencies and humanitarian disasters more efficiently and effectively; enable the provision of land monitoring services (in particular, pre-processed data, pan-European land cover products, high-resolution maps of cities, soil maps and thematic maps) to public authorities (including environmental agencies) in Europe between 2011 and 2013, so that they will be better able to perform their policy-making, implementation and monitoring tasks. Land monitoring services could support, inter alia, the implementation of the Soil Thematic Strategy and the assessment of ecosystems; contribute to the production and availability to public of environmental information, in line, in particular, with the principles of the Aarhus Convention, the INSPIRE Directive and the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS); stimulate, by lowering the cost of access to information, the growth of the downstream Earth observation sector in terms of jobs, innovation and international competitiveness between 2011 and 2013. A fully fledged GMES programme is expected to be in place in the course of the next multiannual financial framework (from 2014). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: research and development aspects of GMES are currently, and will continue to be, co-financed at European, intergovernmental and national levels. Part of the cost of development and operation of all the space-based and in situ installations providing data for the GMES services will be borne by Member States and intergovernmental organisations. The EC will concentrate on domains where Community intervention will provide clear added value. The EU will both coordinate these partnerships and manage its own contribution to GMES. With the exception of a limited contribution to operation of the emergency response and land monitoring services financed as preparatory actions, this contribution currently consists, in particular, of co-financing the following research activities under the space theme of FP7: space infrastructure development carried out by ESA to fill gaps in existing space infrastructure; research on integration of in situ data and space data; pre-operational service development. For pre-operational services, the funding is focusing mainly on development of the processing chain and efforts to validate the concepts and the technologies and services developed.  For the period 2011–2013, this means that the FP7 funds already allocated to the space theme should be supplemented by additional non-research funds under the proposed Regulation to cover GMES initial operations. The proposed Regulation states that the financial envelope allocated to the implementation of the Regulation shall be EUR 107 million. Third countries or international organisations may also provide additional funding for the GMES programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Initiative of Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria, Portugal, Romania, Finland and Sweden for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 November 2000 the Council, in accordance with the Tampere Conclusions, adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. Mutual recognition can only operate effectively in a spirit of confidence, whereby not only judicial authorities, but all actors in the criminal process see decisions of the judicial authorities of other Member States as equivalent to their own, implying not only trust in the adequacy of one's partners' rules, but also trust that those rules are correctly applied. Although all Member States are parties to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), experience has shown that this in itself does not always provide a sufficient degree of trust in the criminal justice systems of other Member States. Common minimum rules should lead to increased confidence in the criminal justice systems of all Member States, which in turn should lead to more efficient judicial cooperation in a climate of mutual trust. Such common minimum rules should be applied in the fields of interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in view of the step-by-step approach set out in the Roadmap, the Commission presented on 8 July 2009 a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the right to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings. This proposal was accompanied by an Impact Assessment. This impact assessment is re-submitted as ""detailed statement"" allowing to appraise compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, in view of the presentation by Member States of an initiative for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the rights to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings. Five options are set out as follows: · Option 1 : status quo; · Option 2 : adoption of non-legislative measures (such as recommendations) to exchange best practices and to establish Community guidelines; · Option 3 : new instrument covering all rights; · Option 4 : legislative measures restricted to the cross-border cases; · Option 5 : step-by-step approach beginning with legislative measures on access to interpretation and translation services (withdrawing the current proposal for a Framework Decision and proposing a new Framework Decision requiring Member States to provide minimum standards only for access to interpretation and translation services). Option 5 could provide scope for a longer term action plan for the progressive approximation of laws in the area of procedural rights taking account of practical aspects either. This approach would not be as dependent on the Lisbon Treaty as option 3. This option would result in an improvement in the quality and provision of interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. It would ensure a fairer trial in cases where the suspect does not understand the criminal proceedings, his rights or the full charges before him. The option would place an additional financial and administrative burden on Member States that currently do not offer training to legal interpreters and translators. CONTENT: the proposal lays down rules concerning the rights to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings and proceedings for the execution of a European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Those rights apply to any person from the time that person is made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State that he is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings, which is understood to mean the final determination of the question whether the suspected or accused person has committed the offence. The Directive will not apply to proceedings which may lead to sanctions being imposed by an authority other than a criminal court, as long as those proceedings are not pending before a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters. Right to interpretation : a suspected or accused person who does not understand or speak the language of the criminal proceedings concerned must be provided with interpretation into his native language or into another language that he understands, in order to safeguard his right to fair proceedings. Interpretation, including of communications between the suspected or accused person and his legal counsel, shall be provided during criminal proceedings before investigative and judicial authorities, including during police questioning, during all court hearings and during any necessary interim hearings, and may be provided in other situations. This provision will not affect rules of national law concerning the presence of a legal counsel during any stage of the criminal proceedings. A person with a hearing impediment must receive interpretation assistance, if appropriate for that person. Member States must ensure that it is verified in any appropriate manner, including by consulting the suspected or accused person, whether he understands and speaks the language of the criminal proceedings and needs the assistance of an interpreter. At some stage in the proceedings, in accordance with national law, there must be the possibility of a review of a finding that there is no need for interpretation. Such review does not entail the obligation for Member States to provide for a separate mechanism in which the sole ground for review is the challenging of such finding. In proceedings for the execution of a EAW, the executing Member State shall ensure that its competent authorities provide any person subject to such proceedings who does not understand or speak the language of the proceedings, with interpretation. Right to translation of essential documents : a suspected or accused person who does not understand the language of the criminal proceedings concerned must be provided with a translation, into his native language or into another language that he understands, of all documents which are essential in order to safeguard his right to fair proceedings, or at least the important passages of such documents, provided that the person concerned has the right of access to the documents concerned under national law. The competent authorities must decide which the essential documents to be translated are. The latter must include at least detention orders or equivalent decisions depriving the person of his liberty, the charge or indictment and any judgment, where such documents exist. The suspected person may submit a reasoned request for translation of further documents which are necessary for the effective exercise of the right of defence. There must be the possibility of a review if translation of a document referred to above is not provided. Such review does not entail the obligation for Member States to provide for a separate mechanism in which the sole ground for review is the challenging of such finding. In proceedings for the execution of an EAW, the executing Member State shall ensure that its competent authorities provide any person subject to such proceedings who does not understand the language in which the European Arrest Warrant is drawn up, or into which it has been translated by the issuing Member State, with a translation of that document. Provided that this does not affect the fairness of the proceedings, an oral translation or an oral summary of the documents may be provided instead of a written translation. A person who has a right to translation of documents may, at any time, waive this right. Costs : Member States shall cover the costs of interpretation and translation resulting from the application of the above provisions, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings. Quality of the interpretation and translation : concrete measures must be taken to ensure that the interpretation and translation provided shall be of adequate quality so that the suspected or accused person, as well as a person subject to the execution of a EAW, is fully able to exercise his rights. Non-regression clause : it should be ensured that setting common minimum standards in accordance with this Directive does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the standards set in the ECHR or other relevant international agreements are maintained. Member States remain entirely at liberty to set standards higher than those agreed in this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Council agreed, at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, that administrative burdens on companies should be reduced by 25% by the year 2012 in order to enhance the competitiveness of companies in the Community. Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and amending Directive 2001/34/EC has been identified by the Commission as one piece of legislation that contains a number obligations for companies, some of which seem burdensome. Those obligations need to be reviewed in order to reduce the burdens weighing on companies within the Community to the necessary minimum without compromising the protection of investors and the proper functioning of the securities markets in the Community. In order to further enhance investor protection and thus respond effectively to the current financial crisis, the summary of the prospectus should be improved in terms of simplicity and readability. This exercise will be consistent with the approach to be adopted following the Commission's Communication on Packaged Retail Investment Products, which aims for horizontal requirements on pre-contractual disclosures and selling practices for a wide range of retail investment product types (COM(2009)0204). This exercise is linked to the European Economic Recovery Plan and the financial services reform announced in the Communication of 4 March for the Spring European Council ""Driving European Recovery"" (see COM(2009)0114. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : p olicy options were considered for the following topics: divergent definitions of qualified investors in the Prospectus Directive and professional clients in Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments (MiFID); restriction of the choice of home Member State for the issuers of non-equity securities below EUR 1 000; clarification of the requirements in the Directive in case of subsequent placements of securities through financial intermediaries (retail cascade); regime for Employees Shares Schemes in the Directive; functioning of the summary of the prospectus; burdensome disclosure requirements in case of rights issues of listed companies, offers of non-equity securities issued by credit institutions above the threshold mentioned in the Directive, and offers of securities of issuers with reduced market capitalization; lack of harmonized liability rules; burdensome disclosure regime for government guarantee schemes; duplication of disclosure requirements; requirements in the Directive relating to the printed form of the prospectus; clarification of the obligation to supplement a prospectus and the exercise of the right of withdrawal provided by the Directive; requirements in the Directive relating to the translation of the summary of the prospectus. Each policy option was assessed against the following criteria: investor protection, consumer confidence, efficiency, clarity and legal certainty, and reduction of disproportionate and administrative burdens. In view of the conclusions reached in the impact assessment, the European Commission considers appropriate to present a proposal amending the Prospectus Directive in order to address the following issues: (i) retail cascade; (ii) definition of qualified investor/professional client; (iii) exercise of the right of withdrawal; (iv) lack of harmonised rules on liability; (v) summary of the prospectus; (vi) employee shares schemes; (vii) duplication of transparency obligations; (viii) choice of home Member State for the issuers of non-equity securities; (ix) rights issues; (x) small quoted companies and small credit institutions; (xi) government guarantee schemes. The impact assessment shows that the preferred options will have positive impacts for investors, companies raising capital, financial intermediaries, employees and SMEs. The identifiable reduction of administrative burdens from the preferred options amounts to approximately EUR 302 million on an annual basis. CONTENT: the overarching goal of the current proposal is to simplify and improve the application of the Prospectus Directive, increasing its efficiency and enhancing the EU's international competitiveness, bearing in mind the importance of enhancing the level of investor protection envisaged in the Directive and ensuring that the information provided is sufficient and adequate to cover the needs of retail investors, particularly in the context of the financial market turbulence that started in 2007. The main elements of the proposed directive are as follows: Calculation methods of maximum offering amounts : the way limits of maximum offering amounts are calculated in the Directive may lead to varying interpretations in the different Member States. Therefore, for reasons of certainty and efficiency, it should be clarified that the total consideration of the offers mentioned in the Directive should be computed on a Community wide basis and not on a country-by-country basis. Moreover, as the limits set out in the Directive may eventually become outdated, in order to take account of the technical developments in the financial markets and to ensure uniform application of the Directive, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing measures in relation to these limits. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. Retail cascade : it is proposed to amend the Prospectus Directive in order to clarify that intermediaries should not be obliged to produce a new prospectus for each subsequent offer as long as they have the possibility to use the initial prospectus of the issuer (with the condition that such a prospectus is valid in accordance with the Directive). Definition of qualified investor/professional client : the definition of qualified investor should be modified to encompass the persons that are considered professional clients under MiFID. Exercise of the right of withdrawal : the time frame for the exercise of the right of withdrawal in the Prospectus Directive should be harmonised in all EU Member States; nevertheless issuers should have the possibility to expand the time frame voluntarily. Lack of harmonised rules on liability : the harmonisation of the liability standards is a goal that exceeds the Prospectus Directive. It is proposed to keep the status quo as regards this issue. Summary of the prospectus : the content of the summary of the prospectus should be standardised following the approach adopted by the European Commission in its Communication on Packaged Retail Investment Products. Employee shares schemes : the exemption for employee shares schemes in the Prospectus Directive should be extended to employees of companies listed in markets other than EU regulated markets and non-listed companies. Duplication of transparency obligations : the disclosure requirements in the Prospectus Directive should be abolished. Choice of home Member State for the issuers of non-equity securities : issuers of non-equity should be entitled to choose a home Member State regardless of the denomination per unit of the offer. The threshold of EUR 1000 should be deleted from the Prospectus Directive. Rights issues : it is proposed to introduce the principle of a reduced disclosure regime for prospectuses for rights issues in the Directive; this regime should be supplemented through implementing measures, i.e. a modification in the implementing regulation. Small quoted companies and small credit institutions : the raise of capital of small quoted companies and small credit institutions should be subject to ""proportionate"" disclosure requirements. Article 5 of the Prospectus Directive should reflect this principle and the European Commission should be empowered to put in place implementing legislation specifying the disclosure requirements in this regard. Government Guarantee Schemes : the Prospectus Directive should clarify that issuers of securities guaranteed by a Member State are not obliged to include in the prospectus information about the State guarantor (though it should contain information about the guarantee). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: as part of the measures to regulate fisheries of bluefin tuna, improve the quality and reliability of statistical data and prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopted at its annual meeting in Marrakesh (Morocco) on 24 November 2008, Recommendation No 08-12 amending Recommendation No 07-10 on a bluefin tuna catch documentation programme. This Recommendation entered into force on 17 June 2009. The proposal aims to establish a Community bluefin tuna catch documentation programme in order to support the implementation of conservation and management measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Member States shall require a completed bluefin tuna catch document for each bluefin tuna landed at its ports, delivered to, and harvested from its farms. Each consignment of bluefin tuna domestically traded, imported into or exported or re-exported from the territory of the Community shall be accompanied by a validated catch document, except in certain cases involving tagging as specified in the text, and, as applicable, an ICCAT transfer declaration or a validated bluefin tuna re-export certificate. Any such landing, transfer, delivery, harvest, domestic trade, import, export or re-export of bluefin tuna without a completed and validated catch document or a re-export certificate shall be prohibited. The proposal states also that Member States shall ensure that each bluefin tuna consignment which is re-exported from their territory be accompanied by a validated re-export certificate. However, in cases where farmed bluefin tuna is imported live, the re-export certificate shall not apply. The proposal contains provisions on validation and tagging as well as on communication and verification of documentation and transmission of data. The current ICCAT bluefin tuna statistical programme, which only covers import and export, was not designed to provide a mechanism to offer direct control on bluefin tuna fisheries. In order to ensure that the provisions in the ICCAT bluefin tuna catch documentation programme are applied uniformly, the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1984/2003 introducing a system for the statistical monitoring of trade in bluefin tuna, swordfish and bigeye tuna within the Community must be repealed and replaced by this draft Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/6/EC requires Member States to accept certain standardised forms (hereinafter, ‘FAL forms’) in order to facilitate traffic, as defined by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention designed to facilitate international maritime traffic (hereinafter, ‘FAL Convention’). Directive 2002/6/EC must be replaced in order to meet the following needs: review of the FAL Convention and consistency with other Community legislative acts: the changes to Community legislation and the FAL Convention are causing greater administrative complexity in the field of maritime transport, which should be reduced while avoiding any reduction in maritime safety, maritime security and environmental protection; a new security information form to be provided prior to entry into a port in a Member State: the Commission has provided the maritime security committee (the ‘MARSEC committee’), established under Regulation No 725/2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, with a draft form designed to ensure harmonisation of information requests. The committee approved this harmonised draft information form in March 2005. Until the adoption of a harmonised form of this type at international level, the Commission is proposing as an interim measure the form approved by the MARSEC committee; insufficient information and duplication of authorities in ports: this results in an increase in repetitive work and a potential cause of slowness or errors which could be eliminated if the use of electronic data transmission systems was more widespread; inconsistent application of Directive 2002/6/EC: a study of 40 ports carried out by the European Maritime Safety Agency showed that although the Directive was generally well implemented by the Member States, it did not always enable the intended objective of simplification to be achieved. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three options were considered: (a) no measure being taken at Community level; (b) given that checks conducted on goods circulating within the internal market are derived from various pieces of legislation, each of them being the subject of simplification on a case-by-case basis; (c) a series of coherent measures being adopted in order to eliminate administrative obstacles to the free movement of Community goods or similar between EU ports. The option chosen by the Commission is option (c). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal for a Directive is to reduce the amount of information to be repeatedly provided to the various port authorities. To this end, it is felt that the transmission of information as provided for in Directives 95/21/EC, 2002/59/EC and 2000/59/EC and Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 and, if necessary, the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, contain all navigation information required by the authorities upon arrival at and/or departure from ports. The Commission proposes, inter alia: to establish a 24-hour deadline by which the information required must be sent, in compliance with the deadlines stipulated in Directive 2002/59/EC and Regulation (EC) No 725/2004; to require Member States to appoint a single competent authority at national level for the collation of information required at entry to and/or exit from European Union ports, which shall be the authority designated for the implementation of SafeSeaNet; to make the use of electronic means of transmission commonplace as soon as possible and by 13 February 2013 at the latest, this being the date given in Decision 70/2008/EC on a paperless environment for customs and trade; to exempt those moving between ports situated within the European Community's customs territory from sending FAL forms, provided that the goods are presumed to have Community status."

BACKGROUND: a new capital requirements framework, based on the 'Basel-II' revised international capital framework, was adopted in June 2006 as the Capital Requirements Directive ('CRD'): this comprises Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (recast) and Directive 2006/49/EC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (recast). There is widespread recognition that further regulatory reform is needed to address weaknesses in the regulatory capital framework and in the risk management of financial institutions that contributed to the turmoil in global financial markets. As part of its response to the financial crisis, in November 2008 the Commission mandated a High Level Group chaired by Mr. Jacques de Larosière to propose recommendations for reforming the European financial supervision and regulation. Building on the Group's recommendations, in its Communication ""Driving European Recovery"" for the spring European Council of March 4, 2009  the Commission set out an ambitious programme of financial services reform. The present proposal is one of the several measures that the Commission has already taken to implement that programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: altogether, fourteen different policy options have been assessed. The preferred option is as follows: Trading Book : with respect to capital requirements for bank trading books, the following targeted amendments, aligned with what is envisaged by the Basel Committee, will be introduced. Re-securitizations : in line with the approach developed by the Basel Committee, re-securitization positions would be assigned a higher capital requirement than other securitisation positions to reflect the higher risk of unexpected impairment losses. For particularly complex re-securitizations, the proposals reinforce both the due diligence requirements and the supervisory process to enforce them. Disclosure requirements : these changes will improve investor understanding of banks' risk profile and, by enhancing transparency, reinforce banks' risk management. The incremental administrative burden for the EU banking industry is estimated at EUR 1.3 million per year and is expected to fall mostly on larger institutions with more advanced approaches to risk management. Supervisory Review of Remuneration Policies : the proposed amendments will impose oblige credit institutions and investment firms to have remuneration policies that are consistent with effective risk management. The relevant principles will be set out in the CRD, but will be closely aligned with those set out in Commission Recommendation on remuneration policies in the financial services sector. Making the relevant principles of the Recommendation binding will increase the rate of compliance by credit institutions and investment firms. CONTENT: the Commission is proposing a further revision of EU rules on capital requirements for banks that is designed to tighten up the way in which banks assess the risks connected with their trading book; impose higher capital requirements for re-securitisations; increase market confidence through stronger disclosure requirements for securitisation exposures; and require banks to have sound remuneration practices that do not encourage or reward excessive risk-taking. Under the new rules, banks will be restricted in their investments in highly complex re-securitisations if they cannot demonstrate that they have fully understood the risks involved, while national supervisory authorities will review banks' remuneration policies and have the power to impose sanctions if the policies do not meet the new requirements. The main amendments are as follows: Capital requirements for re-securitisations: re-securitisations are complex financial products that have played a role in the development of the financial crisis. In certain circumstances, banks that hold them can be exposed to considerable losses. The proposal will impose higher capital requirements for re-securitisations, to make sure that banks take proper account of the risks of investing in such complex financial products. For particularly complex re-securitizations, the proposals reinforce both the due diligence requirements and the supervisory process to enforce them. For investments in re-securitizations of particularly high complexity, banks will have to demonstrate to their supervisor that necessary due diligence standards have been met. If they cannot do so, a general deduction from capital would apply. In instances where compliance with required due diligence is found to be inadequate, institutions would be debarred from future investment in such instruments. In exceptional cases where a bank cannot demonstrate to its regulator that it has complied with the required due diligence in respect of a highly complex re-securitisation, a risk weight of 1250% will be applied to the position in that re-securitisation. This capital treatment applies to new re-securitisations issued after 31 December 2010, and will only apply to an existing re-securitisation position after 31 December 2014 if new underlying exposures are added or substituted after that date. Accordingly, the 1250% risk weight cannot be applied to banks' legacy positions in re-securitisations (unless the underlying exposures of those positions are changed after the end of 2014). Disclosure of securitisation exposures: proper disclosure of the level of risks to which banks are exposed is necessary for market confidence. The new rules will tighten up disclosure requirements to increase the market confidence that is necessary to encourage banks to start lending to each other again. In particular, the disclosure requirements will in future cover the risks not only of securitisation positions in the non-trading book, but also those in the trading book. Capital requirements for the trading book: the trading book consists of all the financial instruments that a bank holds with the intention of re-selling them in the short term, or in order to hedge other instruments in the trading book. The proposal will change the way that banks assess the risks connected with their trading books to ensure that they fully reflect the potential losses from adverse market movements in the kind of stressed conditions that have been experienced recently. Capital requirements for securitisations in the trading book are currently calculated as if these instruments were normal debt positions. This contrasts with the banking book, where there is a separate, more differentiated and risk sensitive set of capital requirements. This proposal envisages that the trading book capital requirements be based on those for equivalent securities in the banking book. Remuneration policies and practices within banks : under the current European supervisory framework, there is no requirement that the remuneration policies of financial institutions should be subject to supervisory oversight. As a result, supervisory authorities have generally not focused on the implications of remuneration policies for risk and effective risk management. The purpose of this proposed amendment to the CRD is: to impose a binding obligation on credit institutions and investment firms to have remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management, accompanied by high level principles on sound remuneration;  to bring remuneration policies within the scope of the supervisory review under the CRD, so that supervisors would be able to require the firm to take measures to rectify any problems that they might identify;  to ensure that supervisors may also impose financial or non-financial penalties (including fines) against firms that fail to comply with the obligation.  The requirement will apply to credit institutions and to investment firms that are authorised and regulated under Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments. The scope of the obligation is restricted to remuneration for staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the bank or investment firm. This targets the remuneration policies for those individuals who take decisions that may affect the level of risk assumed by the institution. The principles on sound remuneration are not intended to prescribe the amount and form of remuneration, and institutions remain responsible for the design and application of their particular remuneration policy. Prudential oversight in the course of the supervisory review would focus on whether the remuneration policies and practices are consistent with sound risk management given the nature of the firm's business. In order to align supervisory assessments, and to assist firms in complying with the principles, the proposal requires CEBS to ensure the existence of guidelines on sound remuneration policies. If a supervisor identifies problems it may require the credit institution or investment firm to take qualitative or quantitative measures to address those problems. Those measures may include a ('qualitative') requirement for the firm to rectify the situation by changing its remuneration structure to reduce the inherent risk and – in appropriate cases – a ('quantitative') requirement for the firm to hold additional own funds against the risk. In addition, competent authorities must also have the power under the CRD to impose penalties for a breach of any requirement of the Directive (including the proposed requirement in relation to remuneration policies). This sanctioning power is separate from the power to require firms to take qualitative or quantitative measures. The amendment is intended to ensure that supervisors have both financial and non-financial sanctions at their disposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. IMPACT ANALYSIS: no impact analysis was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 87(2)(a) and 88 (2), in conjunction with Article 218 (6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal sets out the text of the new Agreement between the EU and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The main elements of the this Agreement can be summarised as follows: Purpose of the Agreement :like the previous version, the purpose of this Agreement is to ensure, with full respect for the privacy, protection of personal data, and other conditions set out in this Agreement, that: financial payment messages referring to financial transfers and related data stored in the territory of the European Union by providers of international financial payment messaging services, that are jointly designated pursuant to this Agreement, are provided to the U.S. Treasury Department for the exclusive purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing; relevant information obtained through the TFTP is provided to law enforcement, public security, or counter terrorism authorities of Member States, or Europol or Eurojust, for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing. Data concerned : the Agreement applies to the obtaining and use of financial payment messaging and related data with a view to the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of acts of a person or entity that involve violence, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or create a risk of damage to property or infrastructure, and which, given their nature and context, are reasonably believed to be committed with the aim of: intimidating or coercing a population; intimidating, compelling, or coercing a government or international organisation to act or abstain from acting; seriously destabilizing or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic, or social structures of a country or an international organisation. It may also concern data from a person or entity assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services to or in support of, abovementioned acts. Since the new systems architecture of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication –SWIFT- (hereinafter referred to as the ""designated provider"") became operational on 1 January 2010, a significant volume of the data which were previously received by the U.S. Treasury Department under the TFTP, have not been available, undermining the benefits of the TFTP not least for the European Union. Ensuring Provision of Data by Designated Providers : the Agreement stipulates that the Parties, jointly and individually, shall ensure that entities jointly designated by the Parties under this Agreement as providers of international financial payment messaging services (""Designated Providers"", i.a. Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication - SWIFT-) provide to the U.S. Treasury Department requested financial payment messaging and related data which are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing (""Provided Data""). U.S. Requests to Obtain Data from Designated Providers : for the purposes of this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall serve production orders (“Requests”), under authority of U.S. law, upon a Designated Provider present in the territory of the United States in order to obtain data necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing that are stored in the territory of the European Union. The Request (together with any supplemental documents) shall: identify as clearly as possible the data, including the specific categories of data requested, that are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing; clearly substantiate the necessity of the data; be tailored as narrowly as possible in order to minimize the amount of data requested, taking due account of past and current terrorism risk analyses focused on message types and geography as well as perceived terrorism threats and vulnerabilities, geographic, threat, and vulnerability analyses; not seek any data relating to the Single Euro Payments Area. A copy of the Request shall be sent to Europol. O nce Europol has confirmed that the Request complies with the requirements of the Agreement, the Request shall have binding legal effect as provided under U.S. law, within the European Union as well as the United States. The Designated Provider is thereby authorised and required to provide the data to the U.S. Treasury Department. Safeguards Applicable to the Processing of Provided Data : the U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure that Provided Data are processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement The TFTP shall avoiddata mining or any other type of algorithmic or automated profiling or computer filtering. The U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure that Provided Data are processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure the protection of personal data by means of a series of safeguards set out in the Agreement. Provisions on data security and integrity are also laid down in the Agreement. Necessary and Proportionate Processing of Data : all searches of Provided Data shall be based upon pre-existing information or evidence which demonstrates a reason to believe that the subject of the search has a nexus to terrorism or its financing. Provided Data may include identifying information about the originator and/or recipient of a transaction, including name, account number, address, and national identification number. The Parties recognize the special sensitivity of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious or other beliefs, trade union membership, or health and sexual life (“sensitive data”). In the exceptional circumstance that extracted data were to include sensitive data, the U.S. Treasury Department shall protect such data in accordance with the safeguards and security measures set forth in this Agreement and with full respect and taking due account of their special sensitivity. Retention and Deletion of Data : during the term of this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall undertake an ongoing and at least annual evaluation to assess the data retention periods to ensure that they continue to be no longer than necessary to combat terrorism or its financing. Where such data are identified, the U.S. Treasury Department shall permanently delete them as soon as technologically feasible. If it transpires that financial payment messaging data were transmitted which were not requested, the U.S. Treasury Department shall promptly and permanently delete such data and shall inform the relevant Designated Provider. All non-extracted data received prior to 20 July 2007 shall be deleted not later than 20 July 2012. All non-extracted data received on or after 20 July 2007 shall be deleted not later than five years from receipt. Not later than three years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department shall prepare a joint report regarding the value of TFTP Provided Data, with particular emphasis on the value of data retained for multiple years and relevant information obtained from the joint review conducted pursuant to the Agreement. Onward Transfer : provisions are laid down as regards the onward transfer of information extracted from the Provided Data. Such information shall be shared for lead purposes only and for the exclusive purpose of the investigation, detection, prevention, or prosecution of terrorism or its financing. Where the U.S. Treasury Department is aware that such information involves a citizen or resident of a Member State, any sharing of the information with the authorities of a third country shall be subject to the prior consent of competent authorities of the concerned Member State or pursuant to existing protocols on such information sharing between the U.S. Treasury Department and that Member State, except where the sharing of the data is essential for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security of a Party to this Agreement, a Member State, or a third country. Spontaneous Provision of Information : the U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure the availability, as soon as practicable and in the most expedient manner, to law enforcement, public security, or counter terrorism authorities of concerned Member States, and, as appropriate, to Europol and Eurojust, within the remit of their respective mandates, of information obtained through the TFTP that may contribute to the investigation, prevention, detection, or prosecution by the European Union of terrorism or its financing. Any follow-on information that may contribute to the investigation, prevention, detection, or prosecution by the United States of terrorism or its financing shall be conveyed back to the United States on a reciprocal basis and in a reciprocal manner. EU Requests for TFTP Searches : where a law enforcement, public security, or counter terrorism authority of a Member State, or Europol or Eurojust, determines that there is reason to believe that a person or entity has a nexus to terrorism or its financing, such authority may request a search for relevant information obtained through the TFTP. The U.S. Treasury Department shall promptly conduct a search and provide relevant information in response to such requests. Cooperation with Future Equivalent EU System : during the course of this Agreement, the European Commission will carry out a study into the possible introduction of an equivalent EU system allowing for a more targeted transfer of data. If, following this study, the European Union decides to establish an EU system, the United States shall cooperate and provide assistance and advice to contribute to the effective establishment of such a system. Monitoring of Safeguards and Controls : compliance with the strict counter terrorism purpose limitation and the other safeguards set out in the Agreement shall be subject to independent monitoring and oversight. The oversight shall be subject to ongoing monitoring, including of the independence of the oversight, by an independent person appointed by the European Commission in agreement with the United States. Such oversight, subject to appropriate security clearances, shall include the authority to review in real time and retrospectively all searches made of the Provided Data, the authority to query such searches and, as appropriate, to request additional justification of the terrorism nexus. In particular, independent overseers shall have the authority to block any or all searches if it appears that one or more searches have been made in breach of the Agreement. Jo int Review : at the request of one of the Parties and at any event after a period of six months from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall jointly review the safeguards, controls and reciprocity provisions set out in this Agreement. Following the review, the European Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the Agreement. Transparency : the U.S. Treasury Department shall post on its public website detailed information concerning the TFTP and its purposes, including contact information for persons with questions. In addition it shall post information about the procedures available for the exercise of the rights, including the availability of administrative and judicial redress as appropriate in the United States regarding the processing of personal data received. Right of Access : measures are laid stipulating that any person has the right to obtain, following requests made at reasonable intervals, without constraint and without excessive delay, at least a confirmation transmitted through his or her data protection authority in the European Union as to whether that person's data protection rights have been respected. Disclosure to a person of his or her personal data processed under this Agreement may be subject to reasonable legal limitations applicable under national law to safeguard the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of criminal offences, and to protect public or national security, with due regard for the legitimate interest of the person concerned. In the case that access to personal data is refused or restricted, such refusal or restriction shall be explained in writing and provide information on the means available for seeking administrative and judicial redress in the United States. Right to Rectification, Erasure, or Blocking : any person has the right to seek the rectification, erasure, or blocking of his or her personal data processed by the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to this Agreement where the data are inaccurate or the processing contravenes this Agreement. Other provisions are laid down to ensure that data received have been rectified, erased, or blocked, and whether the data subject's rights have been duly respected. Redress : specific provisions are laid down as regards redress. Any person who considers his or her personal data to have been processed in breach of this Agreement is entitled to seek effective administrative and judicial redress in accordance with the laws of the European Union, its Member States, and the United States, respectively. For this purpose and as regards data transferred to the United States pursuant to this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall treat all persons equally in the application of its administrative process, regardless of nationality or country of residence. Consultation : it is provided that the Parties shall, as appropriate, consult each other to enable the most effective use to be made of this Agreement, including to facilitate the resolution of any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of this Agreement. The Parties shall immediately consult in the event that any third party, including an authority of another country, challenges or asserts a legal claim with respect to any aspect of the effect or implementation of this Agreement. Suspension or Termination : the Agreement stipulates that either Party may suspend the application of this Agreement with immediate effect, in the event of breach of the other Party’s obligations under this Agreement, by notification through diplomatic channels. Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notification through diplomatic channels. Termination shall take effect six months from the date of receipt of such notification. The Parties shall consult prior to any possible suspension or termination in a manner which allows a sufficient time for reaching a mutually agreeable resolution. Territorial application : the Agreement will only apply to Denmark, the United Kingdom, or Ireland if the European Commission notifies the United States in writing that Denmark, the United Kingdom, or Ireland has chosen to be bound by the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting requires credit institutions, and, within the limits of their payment activity, other payment service providers, and any other institutions engaged in the processing and distribution to the public of notes and coins to ensure that euro notes and coins which they have received and which they intend to put back into circulation are checked for authenticity and that counterfeits are detected. Commission Recommendation 2005/504/EC of 27 May 2005 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation provides for practices regarding authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation. However, the lack of a mandatory common framework for coin authentication results in different practices among Member States and cannot, therefore, ensure a uniform protection of the currency across the Community. In order to achieve an effective and uniform authentication of euro coins throughout the euro area, it is therefore necessary to introduce binding rules for the implementation of common procedures for authentication of the circulating euro coins and of control mechanisms of these procedures by the national authorities. This is the aim of the proposed Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the need for such binding common rules concerning euro coin authentication and unfit euro coins was underlined in the context of the evaluation of the above mentioned Commission Recommendation, carried out in line with its Article 12. This was conducted in collaboration with the Member States, which expressed broad support for the provisions currently proposed. For the purpose of the evaluation, a number of workshops and meetings were organised, also involving representatives of the private sector. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation includes provisions regarding: Authentication of euro coins : the institutions concerned must ensure that euro coin authentication is carried out by means of coin processing equipment capable of detecting counterfeits; or manually, by trained staff. The coin processing equipment is to be adjusted on the basis of a detection test, the modalities of which are defined by the European Technical and Scientific Centre (ETSC). Testing possibilities for these machines shall become available at the Coin National Analysis Centres and at the ETSC and a list of the machines having successfully undergone the test will be published by the Commission. Member States will be responsible for overseeing the functioning of the euro coin authentication system. Handling of unfit euro coins : Member States remove from circulation not only counterfeits but also those genuine euro coins which are no longer fit for circulation. They reimburse those which have been rendered unfit by long circulation or accident but would refuse reimbursement of coins become unfit as a result of manipulation. The designated services in Member States will charge a 5% levy on the value of unfit coins submitted but have the possibility to offer broad exemptions to companies that cooperate closely with the authorities in cleaning the market from counterfeits and unfit coins. Specific packaging will be required for submissions and Member States will destroy the unfit coins removed from circulation. It should also be noted that provision is made for reporting and communication, with a view to presenting to Member States a global view of the relevant activity. The proposed procedures on the euro coins are complementary to the ones proposed by the European Central Bank concerning the detection of counterfeit euro banknotes and their fitness sorting. The proposed provisions are designed for Member States which use the euro as their single currency. This is because euro coin authentication methods, in a less complete form, are already established for non-euro area Member States in the modified Regulation 1338/2001. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Moldova is one of the countries in the European Union's eastern neighbourhood most heavily affected by the global crisis. Despite high average economic growth rates in the years leading up to the crisis, Moldova's income level per capita remains by far the lowest in the region. The policy response to the economic crisis was delayed first by the preparation for parliamentary elections in Spring 2009 and later by internal political tensions over the election results. The repeat elections that had to be organised in the Autumn of 2009 brought a coalition government into power on a reform agenda that seeks closer approximation to the EU and aims at turning around the previous growth model which relies heavily on the inflow of remittances. These political developments have created a new momentum in the scaling up of bilateral relations with the EU, culminating in the opening of formal negotiations on a new Association Agreement on 12 January 2010. In parallel, the new Prime Minister formally requested EU financial support, which is the subject of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: macro-financial assistance will have an immediate impact on the balance of payments and the State budget of the Republic of Moldova and will in this way contribute to the alleviation of financial constraints on the implementation of the authorities' economic programme. Macro-financial assistance will further support the general objectives of the stabilisation programme agreed with the IMF. European Union assistance will also support the authorities' efforts to implement short-and medium-term policies identified in the EU-Republic of Moldova Action Plan agreed in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to provide to the Republic of Moldova macro-financial assistance (MFA) in the form of a grant of up to EUR 90 million. The proposed assistance is intended to contribute to covering Moldova's general balance-of-payments needs and the financing needs of the State budget identified by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It will support the authorities' stabilisation programme with a view to ensuring sustainable fiscal and external accounts, and will thus help the country address the consequences of the global financial crisis. The proposed European Union macro-financial assistance will complement support from the IMF foreseen under the financing arrangement agreed by the IMF board on 29 January 2010. EU MFA is aimed at contributing to covering the country's external financing needs in 2010 and 2011. The proposed assistance will also strengthen the reform momentum in Moldova in supporting the government's economic programme and its efforts towards integration with the EU. It will also contribute to the implementation of the European Union's cooperation strategy towards Moldova and, more generally, towards the countries of the Eastern Partnership. EU MFA will be exceptional and limited in time, and will be conditional on progress in the implementation of the current IMF programme and on the successful fulfilment of economic policy conditions that will be attached to this assistance. Management of assistance : the assistance will be made available in three or four instalments: in principle, two instalments in 2010 and one or two instalments in 2011. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. The Commission will agree with the authorities the specific economic policy and financial conditions attached to the payment of each instalment. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be included as necessary. Provisions are also provided as regards the definition of technical conditions as well as monitoring and evaluation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION:t he assistance will be financed from commitment appropriations in 2010 and 2011 under budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance); the payments will also take place in 2010 and 2011."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2004/67/EC established a legal framework at Community level to safeguard security of natural gas supply and to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal gas market in the case of supply disruptions. However, under the current measures, Member States still enjoy a large margin of discretion as to the choice of measures. Where the security of supply of a Member State is threatened, there is a clear risk that measures developed unilaterally by that Member State may jeopardise the proper functioning of the internal gas market. Recent experience has demonstrated the reality of that risk. To allow the internal gas market to function even in the face of a shortage of supply, it is therefore necessary to provide for a more coordinated response to supply crises, both concerning preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of supply. In response to the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis in January 2009 causing an unprecedented disruption of gas supplies to the Community via Ukraine, the European Council and the European Parliament have called for an accelerated revision of the existing Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment has considered five policy options: 1) no new Community action; 2) better enforcement of Directive 2004/67/EC; 3) voluntary approach by industry; 4) a revised directive; 5) a new regulation. With regard to options 1 and 2, the Commission concluded that the existing Directive is insufficient given the growing import dependence and increased supply and transit risks in third countries as well as, increasing gas flows and the development of the internal gas market within the Community. With regard to option 3, a major disadvantage of a voluntary approach is that participation of all players in a consistent manner cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the extra capacity to ensure security of supply is not necessarily provided by market forces. With regard to options 4 and 5 (choice of legal instrument) the Commission considers that a Regulation is a more appropriate instrument than a Directive for the following main reasons: (i) a Regulation is directly applicable to the competent authorities in the Member States, to natural gas undertakings and to customers; (ii) it does not require lengthy transposition; it ensures clarity and coherence of standards and obligations across the Community and it defines directly the involvement of Community institutions. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on security of gas supply would provide a common indicator to define a serious gas supply disruption. This is known as N-1, i.e. the shutdown of a major supply infrastructure or equivalent (e.g. import pipeline or production facility). It would require all Member States to have a competent authority that would be responsible for monitoring gas supply developments, assessing risks to supplies, establishing preventive action plans and setting up emergency plans. It would also oblige Member States to collaborate closely in a crisis, including through a strengthened Gas Coordination Group and through shared access to reliable supply information and data. The main objective of the proposal is to increase the security of gas supply by creating the incentives to invest in necessary interconnections to meet the N-1 indicator, as well as the reverse flows. The Regulation places primary emphasis on the role of the internal gas market to ensure the security of gas supply. It states that security of gas supply is a task of the natural gas undertakings, Competent Authorities of the Member States, the industrial gas customers, and the Commission within their respective areas of responsibility. It requires a high degree of cooperation between them. The Regulation allows the recourse to non-market based measures decided by the competent authority only as the last resort in emergency situations when all market based measures are exhausted and the natural gas undertakings are no longer able to deal with a supply disruption. The Commission is also given a stronger role to ensure that the internal market works for as long as possible and that measures decided at national level are compatible with this principle. The proposed Regulation would improve the framework for investment in new cross-border interconnections, new import corridors, reverse flows capacities and storages, supported also by the European Economic Recovery Plan. It confirms the greater interdependence of gas supplies within a single European gas market, and provides a sound basis for the EU to defend its interests more effectively in its relations with external gas suppliers. Those interconnections are at the same time necessary for the proper functioning of the internal gas market. The following points should be noted: solidarity measures : security of gas supply is a task of the natural gas undertakings, Competent Authorities of the Member States, the industrial gas customers, and the Commission within their respective areas of responsibility. It requires a high degree of cooperation between them in order to effectively manage any eventual major gas supply disruption; establishment of Preventive Action Plan and Emergency Plan : by 31 March 2011 at the latest, the Competent Authority shall establish: (a) a Preventive Action Plan containing the measures needed to mitigate the risks identified; and (b) an Emergency Plan containing the measures to be taken to mitigate the impact of a gas supply disruption; infrastructure standard : by 31 March 2014, the Competent Authority shall ensure that in the event of a disruption of the largest gas supply infrastructure, the remaining infrastructure (N-1) has the capacity to deliver the necessary volume of gas to satisfy total gas demand of the calculated area during a period of sixty days of exceptionally high gas demand during the coldest period statistically occurring every 20 years; Community emergency responses : the Commission may declare a Community Emergency at the request of one Competent Authority or when the Community loses more than 10% of its daily gas import from third countries as calculated by ENTSO-G. It shall declare a Community Emergency where more than one Competent Authority has declared Emergency. The Commission shall convene the Gas Coordination Group as soon as it declares Community Emergency. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will have a limited impact on the Community budget, covering the costs of meetings of the Gas Coordination Group and the costs of the monitoring task force which can be deployed to monitor the gas flows within and outside the Community. Missions outside the Community in moments of crisis may draw on funds from the Instrument for Stability."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2008/9/EC (the Refund Directive) allows for non-established taxable persons to reclaim VAT on business expenses incurred in another Member State (the Member State of refund) via an electronic web portal set up in their own Member State (the Member State of establishment). The Refund Directive states that applications should be submitted to the Member State of establishment at the latest on 30 September of the calendar year following the refund period. As the Directive came into force on 1 January 2010, any applications concerning 2009 are to be submitted to the Member State of establishment by 30 September 2010 at the latest. Some Member States opened their web portals very late (up to the middle of May 2010) and there have been various technical problems with the operability and access to certain portals. Member States have also had divergent views of how the system should operate from a technical point of view, which have only come to light once the system has been operational. This has also contributed to a number of delays and problems in the submission and processing of applications. Following a number of problems incurred in the practical application of the procedure at the level of several Member States, it is proposed to amend the Refund Directive in order to: (i) give taxable persons more time to submit applications relating to refund periods in 2009; (ii) provide that the Commission can adopt the necessary implementing measures following the opinion of the Standing Committee on Administrative Co-operation. IMPACT ANALYSIS: as this measure does not significantly amend the existing measure, no impact assessment is necessary. LEGAL BASIS: Article 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal will extend the deadline for submission of a refund application under Directive 2008/9/EC to 31 March 2011 exceptionally for applications concerning refund periods in 2009, and provide for certain implementing measures to be adopted under the procedure provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax. This would allow the Member States and the Commission to agree on the necessary technical aspects of application of the Directive, and hence improve the running of the system.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council CONTENT: it is estimated that 5% of all hospital admissions are due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR), and that ADR is the fifth most common cause of hospital death. Some adverse reactions will only be detected after a medicine has been authorised and the full safety profile of medicinal products can only be known once they have entered the market. Pharmacovigilance rules are therefore necessary for the protection of public health in order to prevent, detect and assess adverse effects of medicinal products. The proposals aim at the strengthening and rationalising the Community pharmacovigilance system of medicinal products for human use The specific objectives are: providing clear roles and responsibilities for the key responsible parties and clear obligations; strengthening transparency and communication on medicine’s safety issues to increase the understanding and trust of patients and health professionals and improve the penetration of key warnings; strengthening companies' pharmacovigilance systems, allowing companies to improve their systems regularly whilst reducing administrative burden; introducing a risk management planning for each new medicinal product strengthening the reporting system for adverse reactions by rationalising current system and involving all stakeholders in pharmacovigilance ensuring the proactive and proportionate collection of high quality data relevant to the safety of medicines through risk management and structured data collection. In addition to achieving better protection of public health the proposals will also simplify the current EU procedures with consequent efficiency gains for both the pharmaceutical industry and medicines’ regulators. Clear roles and responsibilities : Member States should remain central to the operation of pharmacovigilance, with increased cooperation and work-sharing mechanisms (Member States not the Commission). companies’ responsibilities are clarified, in particular as regards the scope of their obligation to continuously monitor the safety of products thereby ensuring that all information available is brought to the attention of the authorities. a new scientific committee, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee, is created within the EMEA and it will play a key role in the pharmacovigilance assessments in the EU. the mandate of the coordination group composed of Member States representatives is enhanced for the sake of closer cooperation between the Member States and in order to increase work-sharing. the EU procedure for the assessment of serious safety issues for nationally authorised products is stream-lined through clear and binding initiation criteria for the Member States. Transparency and communication : clear, EU coordinated messages about specific safety risk issues: the Eudravigilance database should become the single point of receipt of pharmacovigilance information for medicinal products authorised in the EU. EU coordination of communication about safety issues and establishment of a European medicines safety web-portal. introduction of a new ‘key information' section in the summary of the product characteristics and the package leaflet. Pharmacovigilance obligations by industry: currently legislation requires a ‘detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system’ to be submitted in marketing authorisation applications. These proposals simplify the existing requirement by introducing the ""Pharmacovigilance system master file"". In the applications only key elements of the pharmacovigilance system should be submitted, but this is balanced with a requirement for companies to maintain a detailed file on site. Risk management planning and non-interventional safety studies : in the existing provisions, companies may provide a risk management system for specific medicinal products if considered appropriate, and there is no explicit legal basis for competent authorities to request it. These proposals require: a risk management system for each new medicinal product (or for existing products on the basis of safety concerns), which should be proportionate to the identified risks, potential risks, and the need for additional information on the medicinal product. harmonised guiding principles and a procedure for the supervision of non-interventional post-authorisation safety studies (i.e. safety studies of authorised products that are not clinical trials), in particular to ensure that they are non promotional, and the follow-up of any safety date generated in such studies. Adverse drug reaction case reports : current reports are submitted to several authorities if a product is authorised in more than one Member State , and lead to duplicative assessments as there is no provision to group assessments by products or substances. The proposals are intended: to make reporting proportionate to risks; to empower patients to report their side effects; to ensure that overdoses and medication errors are reported; to simplify adverse reaction reporting. It is proposed to report all adverse reaction data directly to the Eudravigilance database. for the Agency to take on a new task for the monitoring of selected scientific literature and for entering case reports of adverse effects onto the Eudravigilance database. for medication errors that result in an ADR to be reported to the competent authorities for medicines. Member State authorities should ensure that data is shared (including between the authorities for medicines and any authorities for patient safety) and make clear the legal basis for patients to report suspected adverse drug reactions. Periodic safety update reports and other safety related assessments : as there is currently no provision for group submissions and assessments on products or substances, this leads to duplicative submissions and assessments. The update of product information as a result of these assessments is not governed in detail by the actual legislation. The proposals: simplify periodic safety update report submission by industry and make it proportional to the knowledge about the safety/risk of the product; would introduce work-sharing mechanisms for the assessments, with a prominent role in all cases by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee, and faster updating of product information; amend the scope of periodic safety update reports to become an analysis of the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product rather than a detailed presentation of individual case reports as a result of the submission of all ADR data directly to the Eudravigilance database,; make the requirements for periodic safety update reports proportional to the risks posed by medicinal products, and routine reporting is no longer necessary for products considered low risk or where reporting would be duplicative (with the possibility for ad-hoc requests for such products). make explicit provision for the regulatory follow-up of assessments of periodic safety update reports, to ensure a clear link between pharmacovigilance evaluations and the review and updating of marketing authorisations authorised in the EU. create the framework for the shared use of resources between competent authorities for the assessment and follow-up of periodic safety update reports, with a strong involvement of the Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee. introduce a single assessment of periodic safety update reports for medicinal products authorised in more than one Member State,(including all products containing the same active substance),. This will also be the case for products authorised by the Member States and/or by the Commission. Lastly, the proposal also contains two provisions to improve the availability of medicine in Member States, in particular the smaller ones."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 98/8/EC establishes a harmonised regulatory framework for the authorisation and the placing on the market of biocidal products, the mutual recognition of these authorisations within the Community and the establishment at Community level of a positive list of active substances that may be used in biocidal products. The review of the implementation of the Directive has indicated that for the evaluation of active substances, the simplified procedures provided for in the Directive, notably for low-risk products (Annex IA to the Directive), have no real effect. It has also indicated that the data requirements and data waiving provisions may be unclear or inconsistently applied. In addition, although product authorisation has not yet started, simplification of the procedures concerning the authorisation of biocidal products in Member States may be beneficial in reducing costs and administrative burden for companies and public authorities alike. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers five main issues requiring action: Scope : including treated materials in the scope of the Directive would significantly increase the costs to industry. However, although the equal treatment of industry and environmental and human health benefits are difficult to quantify, they are likely to be significant; Product authorisation : a combination of the Community authorisation for certain products with the strengthening of the mutual recognition process for other products appears to be the most realistic solution; Data sharing : mandatory data sharing at product authorisation and active substance approval stage implies the highest total cost savings to applicants, possibly the highest number of safer products remaining on the market and the highest number of animals saved; Data requirements : the best option seems to be a combination of data waiving with the use of existing information and a new approach to low risk biocidal products; Fees charged by Member States : a partially harmonised fee structure may encourage the development of more new active substances and the retention of more existing active substances. Another option - specific provisions for SMEs - would make the procedure less costly for SMEs. CONTENT: on 8 October 2008, the Commission submitted a report on the implementation of Directive 98/8/EC and the functioning of the simplified procedures (see COD/1993/0465 under follow-up documents). Based on the conclusions of the report, the present proposal for a revision of Directive 98/8/EC aims to tackle the identified weaknesses of the regulatory framework during the first eight years of its implementation, to improve and update certain elements of the system and to avoid problems anticipated in the future. The main elements of the revision are as follows: Legal form: the Directive is turned into a Regulation. As a result, there will be no need for national transposition measures, which is also expected to ensure more harmonised implementation of the regulatory framework in the Member States. Scope: the scope is extended to biocides in materials that might come into contact with food. With regard to materials containing biocidal products, under the current situation, if an article is treated in the EU, then only a biocidal product that is authorised for that purpose may be used. However, if the article is treated with a biocidal product outside the EU and then imported, there is no control over the substance it may incorporate. This could represent risks for human health or for the environment. In addition, this situation is discriminatory to the EU industry, and could lead to the production of treated articles or materials being moved out of the EU in order to circumvent restrictions on certain substances. As part of the revision of the Biocides Directive, it is proposed that all articles or materials must be treated only with biocidal products authorised for that purpose in at least one Member State . Labelling requirements : these have two objectives: (i) to inform consumers that the article was treated with a biocidal product; and (ii) to alert competent authorities in the Member States and trigger any existing inspection provisions aimed at ensuring compliance. The labelling provisions apply equally to EU and non EU manufacturers. Authorisation: the proposal provides for harmonised procedures for the authorisation of biocidal products. The provisions regarding mutual recognition of authorisations are reworked and clarified, in particular the resolution of disputes between Member States, or between Member States and applicants. Apart from authorisations granted by Member States, a centralised authorisation system is proposed. This will be available for products identified as low-risk - without having to go through a separate evaluation of the active substance first- and for products containing new active substances. The technical and scientific tasks relevant to this centralised system will be carried out by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). In addition, ECHA will undertake the coordination of organisational and technical tasks for the evaluation of all applications for inclusion of active substances in Annex I (the Community positive list for active substances) which were until now attributed to the Commission Joint Research Centre. The simplified procedures involving the current Annex IA and IB are repealed, as very little use has been made of them so far. The simplified procedure involving frame formulations is modified so as to allow, within a group of products belonging to the same frame formulation, the replacement of any non-active ingredient by other non-active ingredients (currently, this is restricted to pigments, dyes, and perfumes). The rules on comparative assessment are also modified: the proposed system comprises a first stage where active substances that still give rise to concern and are listed in Annex I, but are also flagged for substitution. Biocidal products containing these active substances may be compared with others that are available on the market for the same or similar use pattern, and if they present significantly higher risk than the latter, their authorisations are refused or cancelled at national level. Research on animals : the new proposal will also reduce the number of tests on animals. In line with recent policy developments, animal testing may only be carried out once. Following the example of REACH (Community legislation on chemicals), the proposed Regulation shall force undertakings, that make a request for an authorisation, to share the results of their studies on animals, in exchange for equitable compensation. Moreover, tests proving the safety and effectiveness of a biocidal product shall only be required when there is a real need. Data protection : the data protection system is significantly simplified, without cutting back on any acquired rights under the current system. It also grants protection to data submitted after the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I (mainly during product authorisation): these studies are not protected by the current legislation. The proposed data protection system also covers the case of newly generated studies. Data requirements : these are modified: (i) the principle of proposing adaptations to the data requirements is formalised and Member States have to inform and assist the applicants with their adaptation requests; (ii) the grounds for waiving of data provided for in REACH will apply also for the proposed Regulation; (iii) the core data requirements are modified and certain long-term animal studies are only required when necessary. Lastly, the confidentiality provisions are slightly modified and aligned with those of REACH. This is to facilitate their application by ECHA. Specific parallel trade rules : for the purpose of facilitating the movement of biocidal products in the EU territory, the proposal provides for specific parallel trade rules: authorised biocidal products that have the same use, contain the same active substance and have essentially identical composition to products authorised in another Member State may be placed on the market of that other Member State via a simplified administrative procedure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal will have budgetary implications as there is a need to support the European Chemicals Agency (the Agency) in taking up the additional tasks related to the assessment and inclusion of active substances used in biocidal products in Annex I of the Regulation and the centralised authorisation of certain biocidal products. The Agency will receive specific fees from applicants for certain of these activities as well as an annual fee on products centrally authorised by the Community. The revenue from the fees will have to be supplemented by a subsidy from the Community."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the recommendations presented in February 2009 of a group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009 (COM(2009)0114). The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 (COM(2009)0252) which proposed the establishment of : a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees into a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), thereby combining the advantages of an overarching European framework for financial supervision with the expertise of local micro-prudential supervisory bodies that are closest to the institutions operating in their jurisdictions; and a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. To this end, the ESRB would provide an early warning of system-wide risks that may be building up and, where necessary, issue recommendations for action to deal with these risks. The European Council, in its conclusions of 19 June 2009, recommended that a European System of Financial Supervisors, comprising three new European Supervisory Authorities, be established. The system should be aimed at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision, strengthening oversight of cross border groups and establishing a European single rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to proposals on: a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanies these proposals, examining the options in more detail (see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: in order to take account of sectoral specificities, three separate Regulations are needed to establish the Authorities for banking, insurance and occupational pensions, and securities. The broad thrust of these proposals is, however, identical. The proposal discusses the common elements and briefly touches upon the differences between the three Regulations. Objectives of the ESAs : these shall be to contribute to: (i) improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular a high, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision, (ii) protecting depositors, investors, policyholders and other beneficiaries, (iii) ensuring the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, (iv) safeguarding the stability of the financial system, and (v) strengthening international supervisory coordination. The ESAs will be Community bodies with a legal personality and a key element of the proposed ESFS. The latter shall function as a network of supervisors and comprise the national authorities in the Member States, a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities, to cover cross-sectoral issues, and the European Commission. While the ESAs should enjoy maximum independence to objectively fulfil their mission, the Commission has to be involved where institutional reasons and the responsibilities under the Treaty so require. The main decision-making body of each ESA will be its Board of Supervisors, consisting of the heads of the relevant national supervisors as well as the Chairperson of the respective Authority. The Chairperson will preside over meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Management Board. The day-to-day management of each Authority will be in the hands of an Executive Director. Tasks and powers: the ESAs will take on all the tasks of the existing European supervisory committees, but also have significantly increased responsibilities, defined legal powers and greater authority. Develop technical standards : a single EU rule book should be established, applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. To this end, differences in the national transposition of Community law stemming from exceptions, derogations, additions or ambiguities must be removed, so that one harmonised core set of standards can be defined and applied. To contribute to this, the Authorities will develop draft technical standards. These standards constitute an effective instrument to strengthen Level 3 of the Lamfalussy structure, which currently is limited to the adoption of non-binding guidelines. Powers to ensure the consistent application of Community rules : a mechanism will be put in place to address behaviour by national supervisory authorities who are considered to be diverging from the existing Community legislation (including technical standards). The proposal describes the steps of the mechanism. Action in emergency situations : whilst ESAs will have a coordination role between national supervisory authorities, in some emergency situations coordination may not be sufficient, notably when national supervisors alone lack the tools to respond rapidly to an emerging cross-border crisis. The ESAs should thereforehave the power to require national supervisors to take specific action jointly. The determination of a cross-border emergency situation will be left to the Commission. This is subject to the safeguard clause. Settlement of disagreements between national supervisory authorities : a mechanism is proposed to ensure that relevant national supervisory authorities take due account of the interests of other Member States, including within colleges of supervisors. This mechanism consists of three possible steps which are set out in the text. Colleges of supervisors : the latter are central to the EU supervisory system and play an important role in ensuring a balanced flow of information between home and host authorities. The ESAs will contribute to promoting the efficient and consistent functioning of colleges of supervisors and may participate as observers in colleges of supervisors and receive all relevant information shared between the members of the college. Common supervisory culture: the ESAs shall play an active role in building a common European supervisory culture and ensuring uniform procedures and consistent supervisory practices throughout the Community. The common supervisory culture may increasingly create opportunities for supervisors to delegate certain tasks to one another. The ESAs shall periodically conduct peer review analysis of national supervisory authorities. Assessment of market developments : although the proposed ESRB will be responsible for macro-prudential analysis of the EU financial sector, the ESAs should continue the work of the existing European supervisory committees in this area as: (i) the focus of their analysis is different, i.e., micro-prudential analysis provides a bottom-up analysis, rather than macro-prudential analysis which is top-down, and (ii) their analysis may serve as helpful input into the work carried-out by the ESRB. International role : through these proposals the Commission is responding to the weaknesses identified during the crisis as well as to the G20 call to take action to build a stronger, more globally consistent, regulatory and supervisory system for financial services. The ESAs could serve as helpful contact points for supervisory authorities from third countries. They may enter into administrative arrangements with administrations of third countries and may also assist in preparing equivalence decisions pertaining to supervisory regimes in third countries. They may provide advice to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission or publish opinions, including with respect to the prudential assessments of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Collection of information : at the request of the Authority, supervisory authorities and other public authorities of the Member States shall provide the Authority with all the necessary information to carry out the duties assigned to it by this Regulation. In principle, all information should be transferred to the ESAs by the national supervisory authorities. Relationship with the ESRB: the framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate closely. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB would need a timely flow of micro-prudential information, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities would benefit from the ESRB’s insights on the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more national supervisory authorities. Safeguard: in view of the fact that decisions by the ESAs should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States, a safeguard clause is introduced which ensures that, where a Member State considers that a decision taken under provisions concerning emergency decisions or settlement of disagreements of these Regulations impinges on its fiscal responsibility, it may notify the Authority and the Commission that the national supervisory authority does not intend to implement the Authority's decision, clearly demonstrating how the decision by the Authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities. Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities : a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities will ensure mutual understanding, cooperation and consistent supervisory approaches between the three new ESAs. Board of Appeal : an appeal system will ensure that any person, including national supervisory authorities, may in first instance appeal to a Board of Appeal against a decision by the ESAs to ensure the coherent application of Community rules, action in emergency situations, and the settlement of disagreements. The Board of Appeal shall be a joint body of three ESAs, i.e., it will deal with issues related to banking, insurance and securities. Key differences between the three Regulations : the main differences between the three proposed Regulations concern the objectives of the Authorities, the scope of action, and the definitions, which are adapted to the specificities of the relevant sector and existing Community legislation. Moreover, the European Council concluded that the ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. ESMA would be responsible to register credit rating agencies. ESMA would also be empowered to take supervisory measures such as withdrawing the registration or suspending the use for regulatory purposes of credit ratings. Supervisory powers could include the power to request information and to conduct investigations or on-site inspections. The responsibilities and powers of ESMA with regard to credit rating agencies will be defined in an amendment to the Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: for the transformation of the existing European supervisory committees into effective ESAs, enhanced resources are needed - both personnel and budgetary. For the EIOPA, the total operational expenditure from the Community budget in commitment and payment appropriations for the years 2011-2013 is EUR 16.984 million. In addition, Member States (national supervisory authorities or ministries of finance) will contribute EUR 25.476 million over the three year period. This gives a total of EUR 42.459 from 2011 to 2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. A high level group of experts, chaired by Mr. Jacques de Larosière, was established to make recommendations with a view to establishing a more efficient, integrated and sustainable supervisory framework. The key recommendations of the de Larosière group focus on establishing: a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that would be responsible for macro-prudential oversight of the financial system within the Community in order to prevent or mitigate systemic risks, to avoid episodes of widespread financial distress, contribute to a smooth functioning of the Internal Market and ensure a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth; a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by the transformation of existing European supervisory committees in a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). On 27 May 2009, the Commission published a Communication on Financial Supervision in the EU, describing in detail how these recommendations could be put into effect, focusing in particular on the establishment of the proposed ESFS and ESRB. The Commission notes that stakeholders, e.g. financial institutions, investors and consumers, can only have sufficient confidence in cross-border financial activities with arrangements in place that properly acknowledge the interdependence between micro and macro-prudential risks. Too often in the past, the focus of prudential supervision has been exclusively at the micro-level, with supervisors assessing the balance sheets of individual financial institutions without due consideration for interactions between institutions and between institutions and the broader financial system. Providing this broader perspective is the responsibility of macro-prudential supervisors. These supervisors shall assess potential financial-stability risks arising from developments that can impact on a sectoral level or at the level of the financial system as a whole. By addressing such risks, the ESRB would be an essential building block for an integrated EU supervisory structure necessary to promote timely and consistent policy responses among Member States, thus preventing diverging approaches and so improve the functioning of the Internal Market. The Regulation establishing the ESRB is completed by a Council decision which confers on the European Central Bank (ECB) the task of ensuring the Secretariat of the ESRB. Accordingly, the ECB will provide the administrative, logistical, statistical and analytical support to the ESRB. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May 2009 Communication was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment has nevertheless been made in respect of the more detailed aspects of the proposal (please see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: the ESRB is an entirely new European body with no precedent, which shall be responsible for macro-prudential oversight. Tasks and powers of the ESRB : the ESRB will not have any binding powers to impose measures on Member States or national authorities. It has been conceived as a body with a high level composition that should influence the actions of policy makers and supervisors by means of its moral authority. To this end, it will not only provide high quality assessment of the macro-prudential situation but it may also issue risk warnings and recommendations which identify the potential unbalances in the financial system which are likely to increase systemic risks and the appropriate remedial actions. The ESRB will have a broad scope of activity, not limited to a specific type of entity or market. Warnings and recommendations may address any aspect of the financial system which may generate a systemic risk. It will also cooperate with the relevant international financial institutions (IMF, FSB) and third countries on issues related to macro-prudential oversight. Warnings and recommendations : an essential role of the ESRB is to identify risks with a systemic dimension and prevent or mitigate their impact on the financial system within the EU. To this end, the ESRB may issue risk warnings. These warnings should prompt early responses to avoid the build-up of wider problems and eventually a future crisis. If necessary, the ESRB may also recommend specific actions to address any identified risks. ESRB recommendations will not be legally binding. However, the addressees of recommendations cannot remain passive towards a risk which has been identified and are expected to react in some way. If the addressee agrees with a recommendation, it must communicate all the actions undertaken to follow what is prescribed in the recommendation. If the addressee does not agree with a recommendation and chooses not to act, the reasons for inaction must be properly explained. Hence, recommendations issued by the ESRB cannot be simply ignored. The ESRB shall decide on a case by case basis whether warnings and recommendations should be made public. On the one hand, the publication of a recommendation may increase the pressure for prompt corrective actions. On the other hand, it could trigger adverse financial-market reactions. Sensitivity of judgement will be required in each case. Moreover, it seems appropriate that warnings and recommendations should not be made public unless a qualified majority of two-thirds of the General Board decides otherwise. The addressees of warnings and recommendations can be the Community as a whole, one or more Member States, one or more European Supervisory Authorities, and one or more national supervisory authorities. All warnings and recommendations must be transmitted to the Council, while those related to supervisory issues should also be transmitted to the relevant ESA. This transmission to the Council and to the ESAs is not intended as a way to water down their content, but aims on the contrary at increasing the moral pressure on the addressee to act or explain and offering the possibility to the Council to comment it. Access to information : the interconnectedness of financial institutions and markets implies that the monitoring and assessment of potential systemic risks should be based on a broad set of relevant macro-economic and micro-financial data and indicators. The ESRB should therefore have access to all the information necessary to perform its duties while preserving the confidentiality of these data. It will be able to rely on the broad set of data already collected through the Eurosystem by the ECB on Monetary and Financial Institutions. To ensure the necessary consistency between the micro-supervisors and the ESRB, the ESRB, through its secretariat, will also be able to request the ESAs to provide information in summary or collective form. Should this information be not available (or not made available), the ESRB will be able to request data directly from national supervisory authorities, national central banks (NCBs) or other authorities of Member States. The regulation furthermore creates a general obligation on the ESAs, the NCBs and Member States to provide to the ESRB all the information needed for the fulfilment of its tasks, thus guaranteeing a wide access to the data needed for the macro-prudential analysis. As some individual institutions can be systemic in nature (because of their size, their interconnectedness with other financial institutions or their risk profile), the ESRB – through its secretariat - shall also have access to individual data upon a reasoned request to the ESAs. Relationship with the ESFS : the proposed framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate efficiently. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB will need a timely flow of harmonised micro-level data, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities will benefit from the ESRB’s insights into the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more competent national supervisory authorities. Confidentiality: the Members of the General Board of the ESRB and the staff working for the ESRB shall be subject to the obligation of professional secrecy. The addressees, the Council and the ESAs shall also take the measures necessary for the protection of the confidential nature of the warnings and recommendations. The internal organisation of the ESRB : the ESRB shall be composed of: (i) a General Board; (ii) a Steering Committee and (iii) a Secretariat. The General Board is the decision making body of the ESRB and as such, will be responsible for the adoption of the warnings and recommendations. The composition of the General Board is a key issue for the effectiveness of the ESRB. The members of the General Board with voting rights are the Governors of national central banks; the President and the vice-President of the ECB; a Member of the European Commission; and the Chairpersons of the three European Supervisory Authorities. The members of the General Board without voting rights are: - one high level representative per Member State of the competent national supervisory authorities, and the President of the Economic and Financial Committee. The proposal describes in detail the role of the Chairperson, the steering committee and the secretariat as well as the Advisory Technical Committee and other sources of advice. Reporting obligations : the ESRB shall be accountable to the European Parliament and to the Council and shall therefore report to them at least annually. The European Parliament and the Council may also require the ESRB to report more often. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary cost related to the ESRB will be borne by the ECB and will not have any direct implication for the Community budget. The cost of such support will depend on the extent to which the existing staff and resources of the ECB can be used to fulfil the tasks of the Secretariat of the ESRB."

Safeguard: in view of the fact that decisions by the ESAs should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States, a safeguard clause is introduced which ensures that, where a Member State considers that a decision taken under provisions concerning emergency decisions or settlement of disagreements of these Regulations impinges on its fiscal responsibility, it may notify the Authority and the Commission that the national supervisory authority does not intend to implement the Authority's decision, clearly demonstrating how the decision by the Authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities. Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities : a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities will ensure mutual understanding, cooperation and consistent supervisory approaches between the three new ESAs. Board of Appeal : an appeal system will ensure that any person, including national supervisory authorities, may in first instance appeal to a Board of Appeal against a decision by the ESAs to ensure the coherent application of Community rules, action in emergency situations, and the settlement of disagreements. The Board of Appeal shall be a joint body of three ESAs, i.e., it will deal with issues related to banking, insurance and securities. Key differences between the three Regulations : the main differences between the three proposed Regulations concern the objectives of the Authorities, the scope of action, and the definitions, which are adapted to the specificities of the relevant sector and existing Community legislation. Moreover, the European Council concluded that the ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. ESMA would be responsible to register credit rating agencies. ESMA would also be empowered to take supervisory measures such as withdrawing the registration or suspending the use for regulatory purposes of credit ratings. Supervisory powers could include the power to request information and to conduct investigations or on-site inspections. The responsibilities and powers of ESMA with regard to credit rating agencies will be defined in an amendment to the Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: for the transformation of the existing European supervisory committees into effective ESAs, enhanced resources are needed - both personnel and budgetary. For the EBA, the total operational expenditure from the Community budget in commitment and payment appropriations for the years 2011-2013 is EUR 21.527 million. In addition, Member States (national supervisory authorities or ministries of finance) will contribute EUR 32.290 million over the three year period. This gives a total of EUR 53.816 million from 2011 to 2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: the Council adopted a general approach with regard to the proposal for a Council Regulation entrusting the European Central Bank with specific tasks concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board. The text has been modified to comply with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It should be recalled that experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. The Commission proposed a regulation establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) with aim to reinforce financial supervision in Europe. The Council reached a broad agreement on the substance of the regulation. Given its expertise on macro-prudential issues, the European Central Bank (ECB) can make a significant contribution to the effective macro-prudential oversight of the EU financial system. As a consequence, the proposed regulation provides that: · the President of the European Central Bank shall be Member of the General Board of the European Systemic Risk Board; · the European Central Bank shall ensure a Secretariat, and thereby provide analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB. The mission of the Secretariat shall prepare the ESRB meetings and ensure the collection and processing of information, including statistical information, on behalf and for the benefit of the fulfilment of the tasks of the ESRB; · the ECB shall ensure sufficient, human and financial resources for the fulfilment of its task of ensuring the Secretariat; · without prejudice to the application of criminal law, any confidential information received by the Secretariat whilst performing its duties may not be divulged to any person or authority whatsoever outside the ESRB, except in summary or aggregate form, such that individual financial institutions cannot be identified; · the Secretariat shall ensure that documents are submitted to the ESRB in a manner which ensures the confidentiality of these documents. The ECB shall ensure the confidentiality of the data received by the Secretariat for the performance of the tasks of the ECB under this Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the recommendations presented in February 2009 of a group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009 (COM(2009)0114). The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 (COM(2009)0252) which proposed the establishment of: · a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees into a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), thereby combining the advantages of an overarching European framework for financial supervision with the expertise of local micro-prudential supervisory bodies that are closest to the institutions operating in their jurisdictions; and · a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. To this end, the ESRB would provide an early warning of system-wide risks that may be building up and, where necessary, issue recommendations for action to deal with these risks. On 27 May 2009, the Commission published a Communication on Financial Supervision in the EU, describing in detail how these recommendations could be put into effect, focusing in particular on the establishment of the proposed ESFS and ESRB. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to proposals on: a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanies these proposals, examining the options in more detail (see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: in order to take account of sectoral specificities, three separate Regulations are needed to establish the Authorities for banking, insurance and occupational pensions, and securities. The broad thrust of these proposals is, however, identical. The proposal discusses the common elements and briefly touches upon the differences between the three Regulations. Objectives of the ESAs : these shall be to contribute to: (i) improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular a high, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision, (ii) protecting depositors, investors, policyholders and other beneficiaries, (iii) ensuring the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, (iv) safeguarding the stability of the financial system, and (v) strengthening international supervisory coordination. The ESAs will be Community bodies with a legal personality and a key element of the proposed ESFS. The main decision-making body of each ESA will be its Board of Supervisors, consisting of the heads of the relevant national supervisors as well as the Chairperson of the respective Authority. The Chairperson will preside over meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Management Board. The day-to-day management of each Authority will be in the hands of an Executive Director. Tasks and powers: the ESAs will take on all the tasks of the existing European supervisory committees, but also have significantly increased responsibilities, defined legal powers and greater authority. Develop technical standards : a single EU rule book should be established, applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. To this end, differences in the national transposition of Community law stemming from exceptions, derogations, additions or ambiguities must be removed, so that one harmonised core set of standards can be defined and applied. To contribute to this, the Authorities will develop draft technical standards. These standards constitute an effective instrument to strengthen Level 3 of the Lamfalussy structure, which currently is limited to the adoption of non-binding guidelines. Powers to ensure the consistent application of Community rules : a mechanism will be put in place to address behaviour by national supervisory authorities who are considered to be diverging from the existing Community legislation (including technical standards). The proposal describes the steps of the mechanism. Action in emergency situations : whilst ESAs will have a coordination role between national supervisory authorities, in some emergency situations coordination may not be sufficient, notably when national supervisors alone lack the tools to respond rapidly to an emerging cross-border crisis. The ESAs should thereforehave the power to require national supervisors to take specific action jointly. The determination of a cross-border emergency situation will be left to the Commission. This is subject to the safeguard clause. Settlement of disagreements between national supervisory authorities : a mechanism is proposed to ensure that relevant national supervisory authorities take due account of the interests of other Member States, including within colleges of supervisors. This mechanism consists of three possible steps which are set out in the text. Colleges of supervisors : the latter are central to the EU supervisory system and play an important role in ensuring a balanced flow of information between home and host authorities. The ESAs will contribute to promoting the efficient and consistent functioning of colleges of supervisors and may participate as observers in colleges of supervisors and receive all relevant information shared between the members of the college. Common supervisory culture: the ESAs shall play an active role in building a common European supervisory culture and ensuring uniform procedures and consistent supervisory practices throughout the Community. The common supervisory culture may increasingly create opportunities for supervisors to delegate certain tasks to one another. The ESAs shall periodically conduct peer review analysis of national supervisory authorities. Assessment of market developments : although the proposed ESRB will be responsible for macro-prudential analysis of the EU financial sector, the ESAs should continue the work of the existing European supervisory committees in this area as: (i) the focus of their analysis is different, i.e., micro-prudential analysis provides a bottom-up analysis, rather than macro-prudential analysis which is top-down, and (ii) their analysis may serve as helpful input into the work carried-out by the ESRB. International role : through these proposals the Commission is responding to the weaknesses identified during the crisis as well as to the G20 call to take action to build a stronger, more globally consistent, regulatory and supervisory system for financial services. The ESAs could serve as helpful contact points for supervisory authorities from third countries. They may enter into administrative arrangements with administrations of third countries and may also assist in preparing equivalence decisions pertaining to supervisory regimes in third countries. They may provide advice to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission or publish opinions, including with respect to the prudential assessments of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Collection of information : at the request of the Authority, supervisory authorities and other public authorities of the Member States shall provide the Authority with all the necessary information to carry out the duties assigned to it by this Regulation. In principle, all information should be transferred to the ESAs by the national supervisory authorities. Relationship with the ESRB: the framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate closely. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB would need a timely flow of micro-prudential information, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities would benefit from the ESRB’s insights on the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more national supervisory authorities. Safeguard: in view of the fact that decisions by the ESAs should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States, a safeguard clause is introduced which ensures that, where a Member State considers that a decision taken under provisions concerning emergency decisions or settlement of disagreements of these Regulations impinges on its fiscal responsibility, it may notify the Authority and the Commission that the national supervisory authority does not intend to implement the Authority's decision, clearly demonstrating how the decision by the Authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities. Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities : a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities will ensure mutual understanding, cooperation and consistent supervisory approaches between the three new ESAs. Board of Appeal : an appeal system will ensure that any person, including national supervisory authorities, may in first instance appeal to a Board of Appeal against a decision by the ESAs to ensure the coherent application of Community rules, action in emergency situations, and the settlement of disagreements. The Board of Appeal shall be a joint body of three ESAs, i.e., it will deal with issues related to banking, insurance and securities. Key differences between the three Regulations : the main differences between the three proposed Regulations concern the objectives of the Authorities, the scope of action, and the definitions, which are adapted to the specificities of the relevant sector and existing Community legislation. Moreover, the European Council concluded that the ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. ESMA would be responsible to register credit rating agencies. ESMA would also be empowered to take supervisory measures such as withdrawing the registration or suspending the use for regulatory purposes of credit ratings. Supervisory powers could include the power to request information and to conduct investigations or on-site inspections. The responsibilities and powers of ESMA with regard to credit rating agencies will be defined in an amendment to the Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies.  BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: For the transformation of the existing European supervisory committees into effective ESAs, enhanced resources are needed - both personnel and budgetary. For the ESMA, the total operational expenditure from the Community budget in commitment and payment appropriations for the years 2011-2013 is EUR 21.158 million. In addition, Member States (national supervisory authorities or ministries of finance) will contribute EUR 31.737 million over the three year period. This gives a total of EUR 52.895 million from 2011 to 2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 77(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the positive list). The determination of those third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating inter alia to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the EU’s external relations with third countries. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. In view of the criteria of public order and illegal immigration, particular attention should be paid also to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed when appropriate. Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 has been amended most recently with regard to the outcome of the visa liberalisation dialogues by transferring the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia to the positive list. In a joint Declaration adopted in November 2009, the European Parliament and the Council underlined their political support for a quick abolition of the visa regime for the citizens of these two countries and urged the authorities of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina to intensify efforts to comply with all the benchmarks set out in the Commission's roadmaps. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council invited the Commission to present a legislative proposal for amending the Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as soon as it had assessed that each country meets the benchmarks of the roadmaps, and took the commitment to examine the Commission proposal as a matter of urgency. In April 2010, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council its assessment of the progress made by these two countries in the implementation of the remaining open benchmarks of the roadmaps towards visa liberalisation. The assessment reports concluded that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina made important progress and only a very limited number of benchmarks remain open. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: none CONTENT: in proposing this amendment to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1244/2009, the Commission is pursuing the objective of adjusting the annexes to the Regulation, taking into consideration the progress made in the visa liberalisation dialogues with Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the last seven months and transferring these two countries from Annex I (the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States) to the Annex II (the list of those third countries whose nationals are exempt from that requirement) of the Regulation. This transfer is in line with the political commitment taken by the EU on the liberalisation of the short-stay visa requirement for all Western Balkan citizens as part of the Thessaloniki agenda. Considering the introduction of biometric passports by the Western Balkan countries as an element of fundamental importance for the successful completion of the regional visa liberalisation process and as in Regulation (EC) No 1244/2009, the proposal, for reasons relating to security and prevention of illegal migration, limits the visa waiver for the citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina to those persons holding the new biometric passports issued by these countries. In parallel with the examination of its proposal in the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission will continue to assess the implementation of the open benchmarks for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina and it will share its assessment in a timely manner with the European Parliament and the Council. For Albania, the remaining open benchmarks relate to: the development of a strategy and policy to support the reintegration of Albanian returnees; the strengthening of capacities of law enforcement and the effective implementation of the legal framework for the fight against organised crime and corruption, including through the allocation of adequate human and financial resources; the effective implementation of the legal framework in the area of the confiscation of organised crime assets. For Bosnia and Herzegovina, the remaining open benchmarks relate to: the strengthening of capacities of law enforcement and the effective implementation of the legal framework for the fight against organised crime and corruption, including through the allocation of adequate human and financial resources; the progressive implementation of the action plan from March 2010 on establishment of electronic data exchange between police and prosecution bodies ; the harmonisation of the criminal codes of the entity level and Brcko district with the state-level criminal code. As in Regulation (EC) No 1244/2009, there is no reason to make the implementation of the visa waiver for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina contingent on the conclusion of visa waiver agreements with the EU, taking into account the European vocation of these two countries and the fact that they have already exempted all EU citizens from the visa requirement. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment has no implication on the European Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the collection of data by type of goods is mandatory for road (Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/98), rail (Regulation (EC) No 91/2003), and inland waterways (Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006) transport European statistics. European statistics on all modes of transport should be collected according to common concepts and standards, with the aim of achieving the fullest practicable comparability between transport modes. More particularly, the provision of comprehensive and homogeneous statistics by type of goods for all the modes of transport will provide a general framework for monitoring policies for promoting co-modality, i.e. the possibility of combining various modes of transport within the same transport chain in the best way, and the modernisation of freight transport logistics. More generally, the proposed amendment, in combination with other initiatives, will adapt the statistical output to current and foreseeable users' needs. Under current legislation, (Directive 2009/42/EC, Annex VIII, data set B1), data are collected on a voluntary basis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: two options were considered: Option 1 : the current legislation is maintained Option 2 : the current legislation is amended. The second option was selected, in order secure a complete and continuous provision of statistical data on maritime transport by type of goods. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of this proposal, namely the establishment of a common framework for the systematic production of European statistics on seaborne goods using the same classification by type of goods as for the other relevant transport statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States via a voluntary collection. They can be achieved more readily at European level since only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at European level, whereas the collection of data and compilation of comparable statistics on maritime transport can be organised by Member States. CONTENT: the objective of the Regulation is to ensure a complete and continuous provision of statistical data on maritime transport by type of goods, consistent and harmonised with the statistics already available for the other relevant modes of transport. According to the second paragraph of Annex VIII of Directive 2009/42/EC, the conditions for collecting data set B1 (data concerning ""Seaborne transport in the main European ports, by port, type of cargo, goods and relation"") shall be decided by the Council in the light of the results of the pilot study carried out during a three-year transitional period, as provided for in Directive 95/64/EC. Subsequently, the Commission reported that the collection of detailed information appeared feasible and at reasonable cost for bulk and semi-bulk cargo. Remaining difficulties have been solved since more experience has been gained with collecting the current variables and by the introduction of the NST 2007 (Standard Goods Classification for Transport Statistics, 2007) as the unique classification for transported goods in maritime, road, rail and inland waterways transport, applicable from the reference year 2008, covering the 2008 data. The proposal states that the first reference year for the obligation to provide data set B1 will be 2011, covering the 2011 data. Accordingly, the second paragraph of Annex VIII to Directive 2009/42/EC is deleted. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: the Convention on Future Multilateral co-operation in North East Atlantic Fisheries to which European Community is a Contracting Party aims to ensure the long term conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources of the North East Atlantic area, providing sustainable, environmental and social benefits. For the purpose of ensuring the application of this Convention and recommendations adopted by the North East Atlantic Commission (NEAFC), measures concerning control and enforcement relating to fisheries concerned may be adopted. The Scheme of control and enforcement applies to all vessels used or intended for use for fishing activities conducted on fishery resources in areas defined in the Convention. NEAFC adopted during its 25th annual meeting in 2006 a new Scheme to improve the control and enforcement of its recommendations. The main change is the merge of the former Scheme and the Program to promote compliance by non contracting Party vessels. The other change is the inclusion of a new Port State Control system which effectively closes European ports to landings of frozen fish, which have not been verified to be legal by the flag State of the foreign vessel. It provides new measures considering control of vessels engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fisheries. The new Port State Control Measures were last amended by a recommendation adopted by NEAFC at the 26th annual meeting. These Recommendations came into force in May 2007, February 2008 and January 2009. They are binding on the Contracting Parties under the terms of the NEAFC Convention. The Community, as a Contracting Party, should consequently apply them. Therefore, this proposal seeks to update the Community rules transposing the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). It lays down the general rules and conditions for the application by the Community of the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. Unless otherwise stated, the proposed Regulation shall apply to all Community vessels used or intended for use for fishing activities conducted on fishery resources in the Regulatory Area of the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in North-East Atlantic Fisheries.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, created the office of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission. According to the Treaty, the High Representative and Vice-President is to be assisted by the European External Action Service (EEAS). Article 27(3) of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the EEAS is to work in cooperation with the diplomatic services of the Member States and is to comprise officials from relevant departments of the General Secretariat of the Council and of the Commission as well as staff seconded from national diplomatic services of the Member States. As is the case for all the institutions and bodies of the Union, the EEAS staffing and personnel policy will operate within the framework established by the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of those Communities. In order to allow the EEAS to operate, certain amendments to the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment are required. Apart from adaptations to the new terminology resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the proposed amendments are limited to what is necessary for the establishment and functioning of the EEAS. This proposal is one of the legislative measures that need to be adopted in that context. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 336 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to be operational right from its inception, the EEAS must have qualified and experienced staff at its disposal. The Regulation confirms that – where it is stipulated in the Council Decision establishing the EEAS that an entity from the Council or Commission organisation chart is transferred to the EEAS – the officials and temporary staff occupying posts in that entity and other staff assigned to that entity are transferred from their respective institutions to the EEAS. Equal treatment : a fundamental aspect of the EEAS is the equality of treatment between the sources of EEAS staffing. Selection procedures for posts will thus be open on an equal basis (as opposed to the current situation, where internal candidates, followed by inter-institutional candidates, have priority). Hence, the Appointing Authority will consider applications for vacant posts in the EEAS from different categories of staff – staff of national diplomatic services, officials of the Commission, the Council and the EEAS, as well as temporary staff of the EEAS from national diplomatic services – without giving any priority to any of them. After the start-up phase, but on 1 July 2013 at the latest, this facilitated access to vacant posts in the EEAS will be extended to officials of other institutions of the Union. In order to guarantee proper representation of staff from national diplomatic services in the EEAS, it should be possible, until 30 June 2013, to give priority to candidates from national diplomatic services of the Member States for AD posts in case of substantially equal qualifications. Specific category of temporary staff : staff will be employed by the EEAS as a specific category of temporary staff. For this particular category of temporary staff, certain rules (retirement age, possibility of secondment, and leave on personal grounds) are aligned to those applicable to officials. These staff members will thus benefit from the same working conditions as officials. Flexibility : officials of the EEAS who were officials of either the Council or the Commission before taking up their duties in the EEAS will be able to apply for vacant posts in their institution of origin on the same basis as officials inside those institutions. Their applications will thus be considered as applications from internal candidates. In exceptional circumstances, a transfer in the interests of the service, i.e. without prior publication of the post, from the EEAS to the Council or the Commission and vice versa will be made possible. Authority entrusted with powers : the EEAS will be treated as an institution for the purposes of the Staff Regulations. The High Representative and Vice-President will be the Appointing Authority for the staff of the EEAS (with a possibility to entrust EEAS staff members with these powers). Special arrangements are foreseen for cases where EEAS staff will have to perform functions on behalf of the Commission. In this respect they will have to take instructions from the Commission. Moreover, the Commission will be involved in the recruitment and evaluation of these members of staff, as well as in disciplinary matters. In addition, account is also taken of the situation of Commission officials working in Union delegations who will have to take instructions in certain areas from the Head of delegation (who will be an official or a temporary agent of the EEAS). Other technical measures : these concern Annex X to the Staff Regulations (applicable to staff serving in third countries), contract staff and local staff. They should improve the functioning of the Union delegations. The whole of Annex X (and not only certain provisions) will apply to contract staff serving in a third country, including Commission staff. Contract staff engaged to perform duties in delegations will be able to take part in the rotation between delegations and Headquarters. In order to ensure better gender balance in delegations, staff serving in third countries will be able to take parental leave while continuing to benefit from certain provisions of Annex X (accommodation provided by the institution or reimbursement of rent, supplementary sickness insurance and education allowance) for a restricted period of time. The amendments concerning local staff are aimed at improving their social security protection. Currently, local staff working in countries with no, or insufficient, social security systems are asked to contribute to an EU-established scheme, while the Commission pays the employer's contribution. A specific provision should be introduced in the Conditions of Employment, as this scheme provides for minimum social guarantees, which are not ensured by national law. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal is broadly budgetary neutral, although some provisions have a small budgetary impact: application of Article 9a of Annex X to the Staff Regulations would result in savings of around EUR 189 000 per year (decrease in expenditure). This is due to the fact that officials on parental leave receive an allowance, which is lower than their salary. The number of parental leave cases is expected to increase; Article 18 of Annex X provides for the reimbursement of hotel costs when the accommodation provided for in Article 5 of that Annex cannot yet be allocated. It is expected that there would be about 24 cases if this Article 18 were to be applied to contract staff. The annual impact would be EUR 130 000 (increase in expenditure); the amendment to Article 3a of the Conditions of Employment which allows rotation between delegations and Headquarters for contract staff engaged in delegations is not considered to have a budgetary impact; there will be no additional costs incurred by the modification of Article 121 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, as the scheme is already in place and the necessary amounts are included by the budgetary authority in the annual budgets of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in March 2006, the European Council stressed the need for a better balance between work and private life in order to achieve economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness, and approved the European Pact for Gender Equality. In December 2007 and March 2008, the Council called on the Commission to evaluate the legal framework supporting reconciliation and the possible need for improvement in this area and reiterated that further efforts should be made to reconcile work with private and family life for both women and men. The European Parliament has consistently called for improvements to the existing legislation relating to the protection of pregnant workers and the granting of parental leave, and for measures to improve the reconciliation of professional, private and family life (for example, in its resolution of 21 February 2008 on the demographic future of Europe, Parliament called on the Member States to adopt best practices as regards the length of maternity leave and in its resolution of 27 September 2007, it urged the Member States to mutualise the costs of maternity and parental leave allowances in order to ensure that women no longer represent a more costly source of labour than men. This is why the Commission has finally decided to review Directive 92/85/EEC on pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding and is proposing to revise it. CONTENT: the proposed Directive amends the existing Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, and in particular its Articles 8 (Maternity leave), 10 (Prohibition of dismissal) and 11 (Employment rights). 1) Maternity leave : Article 8 is amended so as to increase the duration of maternity leave to 18 weeks, 6 of which must be taken after childbirth. This corresponds to the length of leave provided for in the ILO Maternity Protection Recommendation, adopted in 2000, and is intended to generally improve the health and safety of women giving birth to a child. This increase is designed to allow women to recover from pregnancy and childbirth, to have more time with their children, and to be able to breastfeed for a longer period. Under the current Directive the duration is 14 weeks, 2 weeks of which are compulsory before or after confinement. Other measures related to maternity leave are as follows : women falling within the scope of the Directive would be able to choose freely the time at which the non-compulsory portion of the leave is taken (before or after childbirth), and would thus no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of the leave before childbirth as is presently the case in some Member States. It is for the Member States to decide on notification periods; where childbirth occurs after the due date, the prenatal portion of the leave is extended to the actual date of birth, without any reduction in the post-natal portion of the leave, in order to guarantee that women have sufficient time to recover from giving birth and to breastfeed; the Member States are to decide on the length of additional leave to be granted in the event of premature childbirth, children hospitalised at birth, new-born children with disabilities and multiple births. The extra time should allow women to recover from the particular stress that premature childbirth, children hospitalised at birth, the birth of children with disabilities and multiple births usually cause; any period of sick leave, up to 4 weeks before confinement, in the event of illness or complications arising out of pregnancy or childbirth shall not shorten the period of maternity leave, again in the interest of women's health. Prohibition of dismissal : points 1 and 2 of Article 10 are amended: in order to take account of the case law of the European Court of Justice, it is proposed to prohibit all preparations for a possible dismissal not related to exceptional circumstances, during the maternity leave. Under the current Directive, the employer must duly substantiate the grounds for such dismissal in writing only in cases where a woman is dismissed while on maternity leave. The proposed amendment extends this duty of the employer to cases where a woman is dismissed within 6 months of the end of her maternity leave, if the woman requests such a written motivation. The aim of this provision is not to amend any rules on individual or collective dismissal, but only to provide, in the interest of both the business and the worker concerned, that during a certain period after the return from maternity leave, any dismissal should be duly motivated in writing if the worker so requests. Employment rights : the new point 2(c) of Article 11 makes it clear that following maternity leave, the woman has the right to return to the same job or to an equivalent post on terms and conditions that are no less favourable, and the right to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which she would have been entitled during her absence. This is taken from Directive 2002/73/EC, as recast in Directive 2006/54/EC. Rights relating to the employment contract : the new point 2(c) of Article 11 makes it clear that following maternity leave, the woman has the right to return to the same job or to an equivalent post on terms and conditions that are no less favourable, and the right to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which she would have been entitled during her absence; point 3 modifies the existing rule on the payment given during maternity leave: it provides for the principle of the payment of the full monthly salary received prior to the maternity leave. However, this is not mandatory since this payment may be subject to a ceiling, to be determined by the Member State, provided that it is not set below the rate for sick pay. Member States may determine if the level of the payment during maternity leave corresponds to the one of the last monthly salary before maternity leave or to an average to be calculated over a certain period; according to new point 5 of Article 11, a worker during maternity leave or when returning from maternity leave has a right to ask her employer to adapt her working patterns and hours to the new family situation and the employer is obliged to consider such a request. However, the employer has no obligation to accept or follow-up on the request. The detailed rules on the exercise of this right are to be laid down by the Member States. Burden of proof, retaliation measures : the provision on the burden of proof is common to most Directives on equal treatment between women and men. In judicial procedures, the general rule is that a person who alleges something must prove it. However, in equal treatment cases, it is often extremely difficult to obtain the evidence necessary to prove the case, as it is often in the hands of the respondent. The provision on victimisation is also commonly found in equal treatment Directives. Effective legal protection must include protection against retaliation. Victims may be deterred from exercising their rights on account of the risk of retaliation, and individuals must therefore be protected from any adverse treatment where they exercise the rights conferred by the Directive. Penalties : in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice, the provision on penalties provides that there should be no upper limit on the compensation payable in the event of a breach of the principle of equal treatment. This provision does not require criminal penalties to be introduced. Provide a higher level of protection in the Member States : the proposal reaffirms the standard provision, which allows the Member States to provide a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive and confirms that there should be no lowering of the level of protection already afforded by the Member States when implementing it. It also stipulates that Member States shall ensure that the body or bodies designated for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on grounds of sex shall be competent in addition for issues falling within the scope of this Directive, where these issues pertain primarily to equal treatment and not to the worker's health and safety. This provision gives the Member States a period of 2 years to transpose the Directive into national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/35/EC was adopted to combat late payment in commercial transactions between businesses or between businesses and public authorities. It specifies, inter alia, that statutory interest may be charged when payment is not made within the contractual or legal deadline. There is overwhelming evidence that, despite the entry into force of Directive 2000/35/EC late payment in commercial transactions is still a general problem within the EU. In addition, there is also evidence in a number of Member States of unjustifiably long contractual payment periods in transactions involving public administrations. Given the importance of public procurement in the EU (more than 1 943 billion euro per year), late payment by public authorities has a strong negative impact on enterprises. Many public authorities do not face the same financing constraints as businesses and late payment in their case is avoidable. It should therefore be more severely sanctioned when it occurs. Moreover, diverging payment attitudes across the EU might hamper business participation in public tenders, which distorts competition and undermines the functioning of the internal market. It is therefore essential to modify Directive 2000/35/EC. While safeguarding the main elements of the Directive, it is essential to introduce additional tools to reduce the number of late payments in commercial transactions, to shorten payment periods for public administrations and to substantially reinforce the incentives for public administrations to pay in time by recasting the Directive, incorporating in a single text both the substantive amendments made to the Directive and its unchanged provisions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers the following options: Option 1: baseline option- comprises a number of recently adopted measures that will quicken the payment process and introduce new means of pursuing judicial and extra-judicial claims for the recovery of outstanding payments for commercial transactions in cross-border cases within the EU. Option 2a (non-legislative): the organisation of awareness raising activities targeted at businesses. Option 2b (non-legislative): the organisation of awareness raising activities targeted at organisations representing SMEs. Option 2c (non-legislative): Publication of information on bad debtors. Option 3a (legislative): Harmonisation of payment periods. Option 3a/1: The harmonisation of payment periods between economic operators. Option 3a/2: the harmonisation of the periods for payment by national authorities to conomic operators. Option 3b (legislative): increasing the “margin” interest rate. Option 3c (legislative): the abolition of the threshold. Option 3d (legislative): the introduction of a “Late Payment Fee”. Option 3e (legislative): the introduction of a “Late Payment Compensation”. Option 3f (legislative): Extending the role of representing organisations. Only options 3a/2, 3c, 3d and 3e meet the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and consistency. Therefore, these 4 options constitute the basis of this proposal. CONTENT: this proposal is part of the Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Jobs and implements the Small Business Act which highlighted the importance of SMEs for the competitiveness of the EU economy and the Commission Communication on an European Economic Recovery Plan which called in particular for public authorities to pay invoices for supplies and services within one month. This recast of Directive 2000/35/EC aims at improving the effectiveness and the efficiency of remedies for late payment through the introduction of an entitlement to the recovery of administrative costs and compensation for internal costs incurred due to late payment. More specifically, the proposal lays down the following: the provisions of Directive 2000/35/EC on its scope (Article 1 of this proposal), interest in case of late payment (Article 3), the retention of title (Article 8) and the recovery procedure for unchallenged claims (Article 9) remain fundamentally unchanged. The various definitions and concepts are streamlined and brought together in Article 2. The reasons for the other proposed substantive amendments are the following: Article 1(2) removes the possibility that claims for interest of less than €5 may be excluded by Member States. This will clear a hurdle for claiming interest for late payments, in particular for SMEs and for late payment in smaller transactions where interest amounts to only a small sum. Article 4 specifies that, in the case of late payment, creditors will be entitled to obtain a sum for internal recovery costs related to the amount paid late. The objective is twofold: firstly, the creditor would be able to recover his internal administrative costs related to late payment and, secondly, this would have a deterrent effect on debtors, additional to the statutory interest. Article 5 of the proposal tackles late payment by public authorities which will be obliged as a general rule to pay invoices for commercial transactions leading to the delivery of goods or the provision of services within 30 days. Past this period, the creditor will in principle be entitled to compensation of 5% of the amount specified, in addition to the interest for late payment and the compensation for recovery costs. The budgetary impact for national authorities will be proportional to their capacity to ensure compliance with the provisions of the directive. In addition, the expected improvement in payment behaviour of public authorities will help reduce the number of business bankruptcies and thus reduce the social costs that they entail. Article 6 of the proposal strengthens the provisions about grossly unfair contractual clauses. It includes a provision whereby a clause which excludes interest for late payment will always be considered as grossly unfair. Article 7 obliges Member States to ensure full transparency about the rights and obligations stemming from this directive and in particular to publish the statutory interest rate. This aims at providing in the most appropriate way practical information to businesses, and especially SMEs, and will enable them to take action against debtors paying late. Article 10 lays down the monitoring and evaluation system allowing other European institutions and stakeholders an insight into the actual implementation of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications are limited to administrative expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: as part of the reform of external action financial instruments for 2007‑2013, Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 established the Instrument for Stability (IfS) to enable the Community to give a consistent and integrated response to crises and impending crises, by means of a single legal instrument with simplified decision-making procedures. The review of the implementation of the Regulation concluded that certain amendments to the Regulation are necessary, which may be summarised as follows: (1) taking account of a judgment of the Court of Justice : when the IfS Regulation was adopted, the Council and the Commission issued a joint statement in which they agreed that nothing in this Regulation shall be construed as prejudging positions taken in Case 91/05 (Commission vs Council on measures to combat the proliferation, illicit use of and access to small arms and light weapons and which may be implemented by the Community under its development policy). Only in the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice did the Commission decide to amend the disputed article (Article 3(2)(i)) to clarify it as part of the revision of the instrument. It is therefore necessary to propose a revision of the IfS Regulation in order to bring it in line with the case law of the Court which considers that measures against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons may be implemented by the Community under its development policy. For the same reason, Article 4(1)(a) on action in support of the fight against the illicit trafficking needs to be revised in order to refer explicitly to “small arms and light weapons”. (2) extend the participation of partners from developed countries for certain actions : Article 17 of the Regulation excludes partners from developed countries outside the EU and the EEA from participating in actions in support of pre- and post-crisis capacity building (crisis preparedness) under the Regulation. Thus such partners are precluded from participating in these actions, which is inconsistent and poses a serious setback to the attainment of objectives of Article 4(3). It is therefore proposed to open up participation in the award of procurement or grant contracts under Article 4(3) to participation on a global basis. (3) amend the allocation of the IfS financial envelope : Article 24 of the Regulation specifies that no more than 7% of the overall reference amount shall be allocated to measures falling under Article 4(1), namely threats to law and order, to the security and safety of individuals, to critical infrastructure and to public health. The share of the financial envelope intended for such measures has proven to be inadequate and needs to be increased, as the areas covered by this Article are numerous and, even with multi-purpose programmes, only a few can be handled effectively with the scarce resources available. Developing effective actions in the area of critical infrastructure, public health risks and global responses to trans-regional threats requires more substantial measures to allow real impact, visibility and credibility. It is therefore proposed to increase the maximum share for measures under Article 4(1) from 7% to 10%. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid ""in beneficiary countries"", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the DCI and on the parallel proposal amending the EIDHR."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult.

BACKGROUND: since 2007 the Community has streamlined its geographical cooperation with developing countries in Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America and with Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and South Africa under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI). The scope of cooperation for the geographic programmes with developing countries, territories and regions established under the Regulation is furthermore limited materially to financing measures to eradicate poverty through the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is in the Community’s interests to further deepen its relations with the developing countries concerned, which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral for a (e.g. Brazil, India or China). It therefore needs a financial instrument that allows the financing of such measures which, by their nature, do not qualify as Official Development Assistance. For that purpose, four Preparatory Actions were set up in the 2007 and 2008 budget procedures to initiate enhanced cooperation in business and scientific exchanges with countries in Asia and Latin America. It is however necessary to provide a legal basis for this specific type of cooperation in order to formalise these exchanges with high-income group countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers 4 policy options: 1) No EU action: cooperation with the countries concerned remains strictly in the framework of the DCI regulation; 2) amend DCI Regulation: add an additional strand to the regulation to finance ‘non-ODA activities’ with a ring-fenced amount; 3) amend ICI Regulation: extend the geographical scope of the regulation to DCI countries with a ring-fenced amount; 4) table a new instrument. The different options have been analyzed on the criteria of coherence, efficiency and effectiveness. Option 1 is not considered a valid option in view of the need to fill the legislative gap. Option 2 would be the most coherent, but it is not recommended as it would bring different objectives under the same regulation: eradicating poverty and fostering Community interests. In conclusion, Option 3 is considered the most appropriate and effective legislative option in view of the major simplification of the financial instruments. CONTENT: the proposal thus intends to extend the geographical scope of the countries covered by the DCI Regulation which was initially set up for industrialised and high-income countries. The primary objective of cooperation shall be to provide a specific response to the need to strengthen links and to engage further with them on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis in order to create a more favourable environment for the development of the relations of the Community with these countries and territories and promote dialogue while fostering Community's interests. It shall be aimed at engaging with partners which share similar political, economic and institutional structures and values to the Community and which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral fora and in global governance. Two annexes have therefore been included in the Regulation: Annex I (existing) covering industrialised and other high-income countries and territories ; Annex II (new) covering DCI developing countries (46 countries). Furthermore, in duly justified circumstances and in order to foster regional cooperation, the Commission may decide when adopting action programmes that countries not listed in the Annexes are eligible, where the project or programme to be implemented is of regional or cross-border nature. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: additional appropriations are requested for this new type of cooperation – corresponding to the continuation of the 2007 to 2008 preparatory actions. As a result, although the financial envelope amounts to EUR 176 million, the budgetary impact is EUR 67.5 million from 2010 to 2013 to cover activities relating to the follow-up of these actions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for bananas in the EU (EU) has traditionally provided a preferential trade regime in favour of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-exporting countries. For several ACP states, banana production for export to the EU forms an important economic activity with multiplier effects for the rest of the economy. The EU's banana CMO has been challenged since 1995 through the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Dispute Settlement Mechanism, whose Appellate Body decisions have repeatedly ruled against it. Consequently, the EU has negotiated a trade agreement on bananas within the framework of the WTO. This supports the completion of the Doha Development Agenda's (DDA) agricultural modalities and the full Doha Round. Implementation of this agreement will lead to the reduction of the ACPs' preference margin. In order to promote the gradual integration of banana-exporting ACP countries into the global economy, the EU has provided assistance to the banana sectors of a number of countries through the Special System of Assistance (SSA, 1994-1999) and the Special Framework of Assistance (SFA, 1999-2008). The SFA operated in 12 banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The SFA operated in twelve banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The external evaluation of the SFA highlights positive results, as stated in the draft Communication on the Biennial Report on the Special Framework of Assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas. Certain countries managed to enhance competitiveness, as reflected in ACP bananas' stable export volumes and EU market share (see COM(2010)0103). However, production costs in ACP countries generally remain higher than in Most Favoured Nation (MFN) countries. The results of measures to support diversification are less visible and will require more efforts. A reduction in tariff preferences for ACP banana-supplying countries will lead to additional adjustment requirements, building on the adaptation and restructuring processes underway. In view of these challenges, the Commission proposes to create an ACP Banana Accompanying Measures programme for the main ACP banana-supplying countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (“DCI instrument.) The Banana Accompanying Measures to be adopted aim at: enhancing the competitiveness of the banana export sector, where this is sustainable, taking into account the situation of different stakeholders in the chain; promoting the economic diversification of banana-dependent areas; addressing broader impacts generated by the adaptation process, possibly related but not restricted to employment and social services, land use and environmental restoration, and macroeconomic stability. They will take into account the results of and experiences gained through the SSA and the SFA. The Banana Accompanying Measures are proposed as a temporary programme with a maximum duration of four years (2010-2013). The main ACP banana supplying countries are: Belize, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname. The budget for the measures is EUR 190 million. Within this amount, the Commission will fix the maximum amount available to each eligible ACP banana-supplying country for financing the actions above on the basis of a set of objective indicators. The indicators shall include trade in bananas with the EU; the importance of banana exports to the economy in the ACP country concerned; and country's level of development. The measurement of the allocation criteria shall be based on data from years preceding 2009. The Commission will adopt multi-annual support strategies and ensure that such strategies complement the geographic strategy papers of the countries concerned, and the temporary nature of these banana accompanying measures. The support strategies may be reviewed ad hoc, if necessary, but shall not be submitted to a mid-term review. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budget is EUR 190 million. The programme will be financed through appropriations under the expenditure of Heading 4 (""The EU as a Global Player""). It is proposed to use part of the available margin under this heading for EUR 75.9 million. Commission services have assessed the availability of funds over the period 2010-2013 in order to ascertain redeployment possibilities because of potential underutilisation, absorption constraints and/or political circumstances. The analysis leads to a proposed redeployment of EUR 95.8 million under Heading 4. For the remainder (EUR 18.3 million) the Commission proposes the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument. Lastly, it should be noted that the total financial reference amount for the implementation of the DCI Regulation over the period 2007-2013 is now EUR 17 087 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in December 2003, the Commission submitted to the Council a working document on a possible EU origin marking scheme, following a renewed interest shown on the subject by some Member States and some sectors. The Member States and the sectors in question were expressing a growing concern over the mounting incidence of misleading and/or fraudulent origin marks being carried by imported products. In the first half of 2004, the Commission launched a consultation process on this question involving the main stakeholders - industry, trade unions, consumers and other institutions - the results of which were discussed in the Council by a specific committee. Based on the results of that consultation process, the draft Regulation proposes the introduction of a compulsory origin marking scheme covering a number of sectors which see benefit in the initiative and applicable to imported goods only. At present, the European Community has no legislation on the use of origin marking (“made in”) for industrial products. Directive 2005/29/EC aiming to harmonise in-market control of unfair commercial practices also addresses instances of a misleading use of origin indications. However, this directive does not define the meaning of “made in”; nor does it enable controls by customs authorities. Rules on the voluntary use of origin marks which exist in some Member States also differ. The current situation puts the EC at a disadvantage vis-à-vis its trading partners (e.g. Canada, China, Japan and the US) who require origin marking for imports. It deprives EC producers of origin-sensitive consumer goods to realise benefits associated with producing within the European Community, and an opportunity is missed to more effectively prevent false/or misleading origin claims. This draft regulation aims to address these shortcomings. LEGAL BASE: Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to lay down rules and conditions applicable to the indication of origin of goods imported or placed on the Community market. Its main provisions may be summarised as follows: Definition of country of origin: the regulation opts for a definition of the country of origin based on the EC non-preferential rules of origin, as applied for other customs purposes. The application of the EC non-preferential rules of origin to origin marking issues is consistent with EC’s commitments derived from the WTO Agreement on rules of origin. Scope: this Regulation should apply to imported industrial products, excluding fishery and aquaculture products as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, and also excluding foodstuff as defined in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority. Goods that require marking are those listed in the Annex to this draft Regulation, and imported from third countries, except for goods originating in the Territory of the European Communities, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, and the Contracting Parties of the EEA Agreement. Goods in travellers’ personal luggage for personal use should be exempted from the application of this draft Regulation within the limits laid down in respect of relief from customs duty. Goods may also be exempted from origin marking, when for technical or commercial reasons, it appears impossible to mark them. Origin marking requirements: in order to reduce the burden of the new scheme as much as possible, the Regulation limits the requirements and conditions to mark the products to the minimum needed to make sure that the origin mark is easily detected and understood by the consumer, but at the same time not easily replaced or faked. The origin marking shall appear in clearly legible and indelible characters, it shall be visible during normal handling, markedly distinct from other information, and be presented in a way which is not misleading nor likely to create an erroneous impression with regard to the origin of the product. As to the language version, the Regulation gives the option of using the words “made in” or other similar expressions in any official language of the European Community, understood by the ultimate purchaser. Possibility to extend the marking system to other sectors by the Commission: recognising that the specific means of fixing a mark of origin may depend on the type of product, the draft Regulation entitles the Commission to further regulate this aspect. Considering also that other sectors could be interested in joining the origin marking scheme, or that origin marking may prove less relevant for others, the Regulation would also entitle the Commission to include or to suppress sectors. Penalties: the Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this regulation. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Where goods are not in compliance with this Regulation, Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to require the owner of the goods or any other person responsible for them to mark these goods in accordance with this Regulation and at their own expense. FINANCIAL IMPACT: the proposal has no financial impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2004/39/EC and 2009/…/EC. BACKGROUND: around €2 trillion in assets are currently managed by AIFM employing a variety of investment techniques, investing in different asset markets and catering to different investor populations. The sector includes hedge funds and private equity, as well as real estate funds, commodity funds, infrastructure funds and other types of institutional fund. The financial crisis has exposed a series of vulnerabilities in the global financial system. It has highlighted how risks crystallising in one sector can be transmitted rapidly around the financial system, with serious repercussions for all financial market participants and for the stability of the underlying markets. This proposal forms part of an ambitious Commission programme to extend appropriate regulation and oversight to all actors and activities that embed significant risks. The proposed legislation will introduce harmonised requirements for entities engaged in the management and administration of alternative investment funds (AIFM). The need for closer regulatory engagement with this sector has been highlighted by the European Parliament and by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision chaired by Jacques de Larosière. It is also the subject of ongoing discussion at international level, for example through the work of the G20. It is in recognition of these weaknesses and inefficiencies in the existing regulatory framework that the European Commission has committed to bring forward a proposal for a comprehensive legislative instrument establishing regulatory and supervisory standards for hedge funds, private equity and other systemically important market players. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers five policy options: Option 1 : Do nothing; Option 2 : Self-regulation by AIFM industry; Option 3 : Member State action; Option 4 : EU-level action; Option 5 : International-level action. The Commission concludes that, in comparison with industry and national action, EU‑level action has clear advantages, both in terms of effective risk monitoring and control and in providing a secure framework for pan-European AIF distribution. There is a risk that such an approach would not take adequate account of the international dimension. However, international-level agreements would take considerable time to conclude and would likely be limited to broad principles. EU-level action is therefore the preferred option. CONTENT: this proposal focuses on those activities that are specific or inherent to the AIFM sector and hence need to be addressed by targeted requirements. A number of the concerns that are commonly expressed about the activities of AIFM are linked to behaviours (e.g., short-selling, use of stock borrowing or other instruments to build a stake in company) which are not unique to this category of financial market participant. To be fully effective and coherent, these concerns must be addressed by comprehensive measures which apply to all market participants who engage in the relevant activities. This proposal is therefore designed to address matters that call for provisions specific to AIFM and their business. Scope and definitions : in order to ensure that all AIFM operating in the European Union are subject to effective supervision and oversight, the proposed Directive introduces a legally binding authorisation and supervisory regime for all AIFM managing AIF in the European Union. The regime will apply irrespective of the legal domicile of the AIF managed. Operating conditions and initial authorisation : to operate in the European Union, all AIFM will be required to obtain authorisation from the competent authority of their home Member State. All AIFM operating on European soil will be required to demonstrate that they are suitably qualified to provide AIF management services and will be required to provide detailed information on the planned activity of the AIFM, the identity and characteristics of the AIF managed, the governance of the AIFM, arrangements for the valuation and safe-keeping of assets and the systems of regulatory reporting, where required. The AIFM will also be required to hold and retain a minimum level of capital. Treatment of investors : the proposed Directive requires AIFM to provide to their investors a clear description of the investment policy, including descriptions of the type of assets and the use of leverage; redemption policy in normal and exceptional circumstances; valuation, custody, administration and risk management procedures; and fees, charges and expenses associated with the investment. Disclosure to regulators : to support the effective macro-prudential oversight of AIFM activities, the AIFM will also be required to report to the competent authority on a regular basis on the principal markets and instruments in which it trades, its principal exposures, performance data and concentrations of risk. Specific requirements for AIFM managing leveraged AIF : the proposal: (i) empowers the Commission to set leverage limits through comitology procedures where this is required to ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system; (ii) grants additional emergency powers to the national authorities to restrict the use of leverage in respect of individual managers and funds in exceptional circumstances; (iii) foresees that AIFM employing leverage on a systematic basis above a defined threshold will be required to disclose aggregate leverage in all forms, and the main sources of leverage to the home authority of the AIFM. Specific requirements for AIFM acquiring controlling stakes in companies : the proposal: (i) provides for disclosures of information to other shareholders and the representatives of employees of the portfolio company in which the AIFM acquired a controlling interest; (ii) foresees that the AIFM issues annual disclosure on the investment strategy and objectives of its fund when acquiring control of companies, and general disclosures about the performance of the portfolio company following acquisition of control. Rights of AIFM under the Directive : in order to facilitate the development of the single market, an AIFM authorised in its home Member State will be entitled to market its funds to professional investors on the territory of any Member State. Member States will not be permitted to impose additional requirements on AIFM domiciled in another Member State insofar as marketing to professional investors is concerned. Third country aspects : the proposed Directive permits AIFM to market AIF located in third country domiciles subject to strict controls on the performance of key functions by service providers in those jurisdictions. The rights granted under the Directive to market such AIF to professional investors will only become effective three years after the transposition period. Supervisory cooperation information sharing and mediation : In order to ensure the secure functioning of the AIFM sector, competent authorities of the Member States will be required to cooperate whenever necessary so as to achieve the aims of the Directive. Given the cross-border nature of risks arising in the AIFM sector, a prerequisite for effective macro-prudential oversight will be the timely sharing of relevant macroprudential data at the European, or even global, level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lays down the list of third countries whose national must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (“negative list”) and those whose national are exempt from that requirement (“positive list”). The determination of those third countries or territories whose citizens are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating, among other things, to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the European Union's external relations with third countries or territories. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity, and particular attention is paid to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries or territories concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries or territories, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed regularly. The present review of the Regulation aims at: ensure that the composition of the lists of third countries and territories complies with the criteria set out in recital 5 of the Regulation, in particular as regards the illegal immigration and public policy criteria and the external relations criterion, and transferring countries from one annex to another as appropriate; ensure that, in accordance with Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU, the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country or territory citizen is to be subject to or exempt from the visa requirement. As a result, a new modified version of Regulation (EC) No 239/2001 is proposed in order to include a certain number of states in the Regulation’s positive and negative lists. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU. CONTENT: in accordance with the approach followed in the context of previous amendments to Regulation (EC) No. 539/2001, it is proposed to: transfer Taiwan to the positive list: despite the fact that the EU does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state and has no diplomatic or formal relations with Taiwan, the EU has developed regular contacts and cooperation in a number of areas with the Taiwanese authorities. As a result, the EU is the largest foreign investor in Taiwan. Upon analysis, it became apparent that transferring Taiwan to the positive list would reinforce regional coherence as the EU grants visa free regime to other countries and entities of the region. As regards migration, the risk of illegal immigration from Taiwan is very low On that basis, imposing a visa requirement on the nationals of Taiwan is no longer justified; transfer of the Northern Mariana Islands to the positive list : the Northern Mariana Islands are a commonwealth in political union with the United States of America, and the head of the state of Northern Mariana is the president of the United States. The citizens of the Islands have US passports. Following from the above information, the reference to the Northern Mariana Islands should be deleted from Annex I. This will entail that the citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands, as US nationals, enjoy visa-free travel. Lastly, it should be noted that the draft Regulation proposes a new Part 4 under Annex II : this is entitled “Entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as States by at least one Member State,” and the list is comprised of Taiwan. BUDGETARY IMPACT : the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) no 663/2009 established a programme to aid economic recovery for Europe (EEPR) by granting €3.98 billion by the end of 2010. This Community financing was allocated to three sub-programmes in the field of gas and electricity infrastructure projects; offshore wind electricity projects (OWE), and carbon capture and storage projects (CCS). It is estimated in the report from the Commission of 27 April 2010 on the implementation of the EEPR that almost the entire EEPR financial envelope will be committed in the course of spring 2010. An amount of around €114 million will however not be committed under the EEPR Regulation. The amount of uncommitted funds will be known by the end of 2010. In the spirit of the Europe 2020 strategy for sustainable growth and jobs, the development of further renewable sources and the promotion of energy efficiency would contribute to Greener Growth, building a competitive and sustainable economy, and tackling climate change. By giving support to these policies, Europe will create new jobs and green market opportunities fostering the development of a competitive, secure and sustainable economy. Providing for increased financial incentive and technical assistance is a key element to address the barriers of high up-front cost and lack of information and stimulate sustainable energy improvements. In a market constrained by the prevailing economical crises and in a time of caution by commercial banks, generating low investment rates, there are additional barriers for project financing to promote this policy area. Existing experiences across Europe demonstrate how well-targeted and well-designed financial aid policies can lead to massive improvement and succeed to tap the development potential of sustainable energy. Investments help in sustainable energy can be most effective and beneficial when targeted at municipal and local levels. In the 2nd Strategic Energy Review, the European Commission's announced its intention to launch a Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative in cooperation with the European Investment Bank and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in order to establish appropriate financing mechanisms for the massive development of energy efficiency and renewable energies. A dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives within the Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative should therefore be created to use the uncommitted funds under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 663/2009. IMPACT ANALYSIS: no impact analysis was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(1)(c) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to use the uncommitted funds under Chapter II of the EEPR Regulation for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives within the Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative. The financial facility shall support the development of bankable energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and facilitate the financing of investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, in particular in urban settings. In order to foster a large number of decentralised investments, municipal, local and regional public authorities will be the beneficiaries. The approach will build up on the success of the Covenant of Mayors, signed up by more than 1600 regions and cities across Europe. The sustainable energy projects to be financed include public and private buildings, high energy efficient combined heat and power (CHP) and district heating/cooling networks (in particular from renewable energy sources), decentralised renewable energy sources embedded in local settings, clean urban transport and local infrastructure such as smart grids, efficient street lighting, and smart metering. So as to maximise the impact of the EU funding in the short term, the facility should be managed by one or several financial intermediaries such as International Financial Institutions (IFIs). The selection should be operated on the basis of the demonstrated capacity of the financial intermediaries to use the funding in the most efficient and effective way and with the highest leverage between the EU funding and the total investment in order to raise significant investments in the EU. In compliance with Regulation (EC) No 663/2009, the facility should be limited to the financing of measures that have a rapid, measurable and substantial impact on economic recovery within the EU, increased energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 should fully apply to the selection and eligibility of the measures financed under the facility. The geographical balance of the projects should also be taken into account as an essential element. Since the exact amount of uncommitted funds may be known just by the end of 2010, individual legal commitments implementing budgetary commitments should be made by 31 March 2011. Due to the urgent need to address the economic crises and the Union's pressing energy needs, expenditure should be eligible as from 13 July 2009 as many applicants requested the eligibility of expenditure from the submission of the grant application in line with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (Financial Regulation). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: first paragraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: currently as an exception to State aid rules, the German authorities may grant State aid under the German Alcohol Monopoly for products marketed, after further transformation, by the monopoly, as ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. The total allowed State aid is limited to EUR 110 million per year. According to Article 182(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation), the derogation ends on 31 December 2010. This proposal extends the application of the derogation and proposes that the production/sales by the monopoly shall gradually decrease so that the monopoly will finally cease to exist as from 1 January 2018. Two categories of distilleries are dealt with differently: the agricultural bonded distilleries (landwirtschaftliche Verschlussbrennereien – there are currently about 670 distilleries of this type) processing mainly cereals and potatoes, may remain in the monopoly until the end of 2013. Their production will however be gradually reduced from 540.000 hl in 2011, to 360.000 hl in 2012 and 180.000 hl in 2013. When leaving the Monopoly the agricultural bonded distilleries may receive a compensatory aid of EUR 257,50 per hl of nominal distilling rights. This compensatory aid is granted at the latest on 31 December 2013, but may be paid in several instalments until 31 December 2017; -the small-scale flat-rate distilleries (Abfindungsbrennereien), distillery users (Stoffbesitzer) and fruit cooperative distilleries (Obstgemeinschaftsbrennereien) which are locally-oriented and produce very small quantities of alcohol from fruits (up to 300 litres per year) may produce in total up to 60.000 hl annually until the end of 2017. The total amount of aid paid from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 shall not exceed EUR 269.9 million and the total amount of aid paid from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2017 shall not exceed EUR 268 million. Germany will continue to present an annual report to the Commission on the functioning of the system. Moreover, from 2013 to 2016 Germany will on a yearly basis include an annual phasing-out plan for the small-scale flat-rate distilleries, distillery users and fruit cooperative distilleries. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: the proposal has no financial implications for the European Union budget."

LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Record of Discussions of the Trade in Pharmaceutical Products is an arrangement between the most important pharmaceutical producing countries to reduce to zero and on an MFN basis their WTO bindings of duties on certain pharmaceutical products, including active ingredients and intermediates. The Parties to the Agreement are the EU, US, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and Macao (China). The arrangement originally covered over six thousand products. However, given that new pharmaceutical products are constantly being developed, the arrangement envisages periodic reviews. The Parties agreed to ""meet under the auspices of the Council for Trade in Goods of the WTO, normally at least once every three years, to review the product coverage with a view to including, by consensus, additional pharmaceutical products for tariff elimination."" The coverage was first reviewed in 1995-1996 and as a result an extra 465 products received duty free treatment. The second review in 1998 (implemented in July 1999) resulted in an extra 639 products receiving duty free treatment. The third review in 2006 resulted in the addition of 1290 products. A fourth review of the products covered by the Record was launched in 2009, in accordance with Article 3 of the Record, which requires Participants to review at least once every three years the product coverage with a view to including additional pharmaceutical products for tariff elimination. The EU participated in these technical discussions. In the course of these discussions, Participants concluded that additional INNs and pharmaceutical intermediates used for production and manufacture of finished pharmaceuticals should be granted duty-free treatment and that the list of specified prefixes and suffixes for salts, esters or hydrates of INNs should be expanded, thereby adding 718 new substances to the list of products eligible for duty-free treatment. This proposal invites the Council and Parliament to authorize the addition of 718 supplementary chemical and pharmaceutical products to the existing list of 8619 duty-free products on their imports into the EU.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in view of the Implementation Plan adopted at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development adopted at Johannesburg in 2002, the European Community is committed inter alia to maintain or restore fisheries stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield with the aim of achieving these goals for depleted stocks on an urgent basis and where possible not later than 2015. The anchovy fishery in Bay of Biscay has been closed since 2005 due to the poor state of that stock. In order to improve the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay, at a level that allows its sustainable exploitation in accordance with maximum sustainable yield, it is necessary to provide for measures for long-term management of the stock ensuring the exploitation of that stock at high yields consistent with maximum sustainable yield and guaranteeing, as far as possible, the stability of the fishery while maintaining a low risk of stock collapse. It stems from the advice provided by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) that harvesting a constant proportion of the spawning stock biomass would provide for sustainable stock management. The STECF also advises that the minimum spawning biomass level at which the stock could start to be harvested should be set at 24 000 tonnes and the precautionary biomass levels at 33 000 tonnes. Furthermore, the appropriate harvest rate should be 30% of the spawning stock biomass each year, subject to appropriate restrictions. This rate would minimize the risk of the stock falling below the minimum spawning biomass level, as well as the probability of a fishery closure, while keeping high yields. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered two main options, including three sub options: Option 1 : no policy change; Option 2 : long-term plan with 3 alternative sub-options Rule A: a strategy with relatively higher TAC levels but higher collapse risks; Rule B: a strategy with relatively lower TAC levels and lower collapse risks; Rule C: a strategy being a compromise between options A and B. Analysis indicated that a system based on a TAC set mid-year according to the June scientific advice, with a harvest rule establishing the annual TAC level automatically would be the preferred management option for the stock. The system would also include provisions on a closure when biomass is below a certain threshold. CONTENT: the objective of the plan shall be to maintain the biomass of the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay at a level that allows its sustainable exploitation in accordance with maximum sustainable yield, on the basis of scientific advice, and while ensuring as much stability and profitability for the fishing sector as is practicable. The main elements of the new plan are as follows: The need to set a long-term management plan instead of annual ad hoc measures to set fishing possibilities : the anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay is currently closed. In order to re-open the fishery, the Commission agrees with scientific advice and the views expressed by the stakeholders that this should only be done on the basis of a long-term strategy articulated around an appropriate harvesting rule. Proposal for an appropriate harvest control rule in order to guarantee the stability of the fishery : this long-term plan follows a harvest control rule that should ensure the exploitation of the anchovy at high yields, guarantee the stability of the fishery and have a low risk of stock collapse. Various options regarding possible rules assessed. On the basis of the results of the assessment, the proposal establishes an appropriate rule, according to which annual TACs (Total Allowable Catch) will be calculated. Strengthening control and enforcement : control provisions must also be incorporated into the long term plan. They should form the basis for a reinforced control regime and thus represent additional requirements to those laid down in the general control system of the Common Fisheries Policy, currently under review. Once the new Control Regulation is adopted, it should overrule the corresponding chapter in this Regulation. The proposal includes a provision providing for an evaluation of the plan each three years from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. The proposed plan sets a minimum spawning biomass level based on scientific advice from STECF and ICES, below which the fishery should remain closed. An evaluation clause is included in the proposal to ensure that this value can be amended, if appropriate in the light of new scientific information and advice. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in view of the Plan of Implementation adopted at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, the European Community is committed inter alia to maintaining or restoring stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield with the aim of achieving these goals for depleted stocks on an urgent basis and where possible not later than 2015. Moreover, during the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the Commission and Council agreed to implement multi-annual plans and recovery plans concerning fisheries resources of interest to the Community. The Western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel is by far the most important of the three horse mackerel stocks which inhabit the Community's continental shelf. The current management system does not serve the horse mackerel situation very well. The biological information on this stock is not sufficient for a full stock assessment that would allow setting a fishing mortality target related to maximum sustainable yield and relate total allowable catches to scientific catch predictions. However, the index of egg abundance which is being calculated since 1977 in triennial international surveys can be used as a biological indicator for the development of the stock size. Advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) indicates that a harvest control rule based on the trend in egg abundance from the last three egg surveys would provide for sustainable stock management. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered three options: Option 1 : no policy change: continue fixing the fishing possibilities as a yearly ad hoc exercise based on annual scientific advice and political considerations; Option 2 : freezing or gradually reducing fishing pressure in view of the insufficient knowledge about the biological status of the stock; Option 3: management plan . The impact assessment concludes that the most suitable option is the one that consists of proposing a long-term management plan, which sets TACs stable for three years according to a harvest control rule based on a precautionary advice for the harvest level adjusted by a trend that reflects the tri-annual results of egg surveys. CONTENT: the plan's objective is to maintain the biomass of western horse mackerel at a level that ensures its sustainable exploitation, and to provide the highest long-term yield. To this end, the harvest control rule should be based in equal parts on precautionary advice given for average recruitment conditions, and on recent total allowable catches adjusted by a factor that reflects the recent trend in the stock abundance as measured through egg production. The proposal includes a provision for evaluation of management measures each sixth year from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. In view of the revision clause built into the plan, the harvest rule could be adapted to more precise scientific assessments once these are available. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use provides for a harmonised framework on advertising of medicines at Community level, the application of which remains a responsibility of Member States. This legislation prohibits the advertising to the general public of medicines subject to prescription. However, neither the Directive nor Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 include detailed provisions on information on medicinal products, providing only that certain information supply activities are exempted from the advertising provisions. Therefore, Community legislation does not prevent Member States from establishing their own approaches regarding the provision of information on medicinal products as long as the above mentioned rules on advertising are respected. In addition, the boundaries between advertising and information, and therefore the field of application of the legislation's restrictions on advertising, are not interpreted consistently across the Community.

According to the Report, rules and practices on what information can be made available vary significantly among Member States. Moreover, divergences in terms of rules and practices on what information can be made available have a negative impact on legal certainty for marketing authorisation holders with cross-border activity.

The aim is to enhance the rational use of these medicines, while ensuring that the legislative framework continues to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines. The main elements of the proposals can be summarised as follows: clarifying that the provision of information on prescription-only medicines directly to the public by marketing authorisation holders is allowed, without prejudice to the prohibition on advertising, provided that clearly defined conditions are fulfilled; establishing harmonised conditions on the content of information which marketing authorisation holders are allowed to disseminate (information approved by the competent authorities for granting marketing authorisation, whether used literally or presented in a different way, and other limited medicine-related information); establishing harmonised quality standards for such information, to ensure that it is of high-quality and non-promotional; determining the authorised channels of information provision, in order to exclude unsolicited means of dissemination; introducing the obligation for Member States to establish a monitoring system to ensure that the abovementioned provisions on content of information, quality standards and dissemination channels are complied with and ensure enforcement in case of non-compliance. The proposal leaves it up to the Member States to decide the most appropriate monitoring mechanisms, but lays down a general rule that monitoring should take place after dissemination of information, with certain exceptions (where prior approval would be necessary) in the case of certain modalities of information where the distinction between advertising and non-promotional information is more difficult to establish. For products authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, certain approval tasks are given to the European Medicines Agency; establishing specific monitoring rules for information disseminated through websites, to take account of the cross-border nature of information provided over the Internet and to allow Member State cooperation and avoid duplication of monitoring."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: uncertainty about the scope of the Directive, lack of clarity on legal provisions and definitions as well as disparities in Member States' approaches to product compliance and potential duplication of procedure with other pieces of EU legislation such as REACH, generate unnecessary administrative costs. If the RoHS Directive is not reviewed, environmental benefits reaped from the legislation will remain sub-optimal. Uncertainty among manufacturers about legal requirements for demonstrating compliance with the RoHS Directive and about enforcement methodologies in the 27 Member States will persist, maintaining or increasing administrative burden. The RoHS recast will enhance its complementarity and coherence with other relevant Community legislation, such as the ""Marketing of Products Package"" (regarding definitions and enforcement), REACH (regarding the use of substances), the Energy-using Products (EuP) Directive regarding the design of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), and legislation related to management of waste from EEE. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden and make the RoHS Directive more cost effective. CONTENT: the basic objectives and mechanisms of this Directive have not been changed. The ultimate aim is the elimination of certain hazardous substances from electrical and electronic equipment; where this is temporarily not possible, exemptions are granted. No new substances are proposed to be banned. The main proposed modifications are as follows: Harmonisation of the scope : two new annexes describing the Directive’s scope are added, the first describing the broad product categories and the second, amendable by the Commission, providing binding product lists within each category. Medical devices and control and monitoring instruments are included to reap the environmental and health benefits from the reduction of use of hazardous substances in such equipment, but in a gradual manner so that adverse socioeconomic impacts are avoided. Definitions : the definitions for economic operators are aligned to the ""Marketing of products"" package and new definitions, such as for ""medical devices"" and ""homogeneous material"" are added. Harmonised definitions, coherent with related Community legislation, enhance legal clarity and reduce administrative cost. Substance ban : maximum concentration values for the banned substances are set (incorporation in the Directive of a Commission Decision) and permission to use non-compliant spare parts is extended to equipment benefiting from an exemption when placed on the market, to prevent premature withdrawal of equipment from use. A new annex with exemptions specific to the new product categories (medical devices and control and monitoring instruments) is added for cases where substitution is currently not feasible. A mechanism for introducing new substance bans in line with the REACH methodology is inserted to ensure coherence and maximise synergy with the work carried out under the chemicals' legislation. Detailed rules of this process will be developed through comitology. When developing these detailed rules, the Commission will give priority to using the expertise available at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The Commission will invite ECHA to evaluate the substances concerned as a priority. Exemptions mechanism : a 4-year maximum validity period for the exemptions is set to stimulate substitution efforts, provide legal security and shift the burden of proof to the applicant, in line with REACH. New criteria such as availability and reliability for granting exemptions are introduced to take into account broader socio-economic aspects. A mandate is given to the Commission for establishing detailed rules for the applicants to apply when requesting an exemption for facilitating them and speeding up the scrutiny process. Evaluation of product conformity and market surveillance mechanisms : new provisions introduce product conformity assessment requirements and market surveillance mechanisms in line with the ""Marketing of products"" package. Reducing the number of non-compliant products through strengthened and harmonised market surveillance is a cost effective way of increasing the environmental benefit of the Directive. Harmonised conformity assessment requirements increase legal certainty and reduce the administrative cost for Member States and manufacturers."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/109/EC (see CNS/2001/0074) provides for the integration of third-country nationals who are long-term residents in the Member States. In 2001, the Commission had proposed that refugees should be able to qualify for long-term resident status after 5 years of legal and continuous residence in a Member States. However, it was finally decided to exclude refugees from the scope of the Directive. Thus, refugees as well as beneficiaries of international protection, are currently not entitled to long-term resident status. In the Joint Statement from the Council and the Commission, made at the JHA Council of 8 May 2003, it was agreed that the Commission would table a proposal for a Directive on the extension of long-term resident status to refugees and persons under subsidiary protection, taking into account the study on transfer of protection status. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal, therefore, is to amend Council Directive 2003/109/EC “concerning the status of third-country national who are long-term residents”, by extending its scope to include “beneficiaries of international protection”. “Beneficiaries of international protection” or beneficiaries of subsidiary protection are defined by Council Directive 2004/83/EC as “third country nationals or stateless persons who have been granted refugee or subsidiary protection status”. By extending the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC, beneficiaries of international protection will be entitled to he same legal certainty and rights as those enjoyed by EU nationals after five years of legal residence. In summary, the Commission is proposing the following amendments to the Directive: Long term resident status in a first Member State: Beneficiaries of international protection will be able to acquire long-term resident status in the Member State which has granted them protection subject to the same conditions as other third country nationals. In addition, beneficiaries of international protection who obtain long-term resident status should be able to enjoy the rights and benefits attached to this status and should be subject to the same restrictions and limitations of these rights. The initial grant of protection will require respect for the principle of non-refoulement, in the event of withdrawal or loss of the long-term resident status in the first Member State. Residence, and long-term resident status, in a second Member State : to recall, Chapter III of Directive 2003/109/EC sets out the conditions under which long-term residents may exercise their right of residence in another EU Member States. The Commission proposes that these conditions apply, in full, to beneficiaries of international protection who have been granted long-term residence. Beneficiaries of international protection applying under Article 23 of Directive 2003/109/EC for long-term resident status in a different Member State from that which granted them international protection should also be obliged to comply with all relevant conditions required by Directive 2003/109/EC. No Community mechanism on “transfer of responsibility” for protection under the amended Directive : Directive 2003/109/EC only grants, under certain conditions, the right to take up residence in a second Member States to those who have been granted long-term residency. It does not extend to beneficiaries of international protection. The Commission proposes that this issue remain outside the scope of the amended Directive. As a result, requests for transfer of protection remain governed by the 1951 Geneva Convention and by the European Agreement on transfer of responsibility for refugees concluded in the framework of the Council of Europe. Respecting the principle of non-refoulement by the second Member State: Since the proposal does not deal with the transfer of responsibility for international protection, the Commission points out that it is important to safeguard respect for the principle of non-refoulement in the second Member States. It is important, therefore, that the authorities of the second Member State are fully aware that a long-term resident applying for residence in the territory of that Member State was granted international protection in another Member States. To this end, the Commission proposes that this information be mentioned on the long-term residence permit. Readmission of a third country national with long-term resident status : for the cases where a long-term resident status has not yet been granted in the second Member State, Article 22 of Directive 2003/109/EC should also be amended so that the removal from the second Member State of long-term residents whose permits contain the remark stating that they are beneficiaries of international protection in another Member State - and who therefore may still have protection needs - is possible only to the first Member State; for the case where a long-term resident status was granted in the second Member State, Article 12 should be amended so as to provide that where the authorities of the second Member State consider the adoption of an expulsion measure, they are obliged to consult the authorities of the Member State which granted the protection to the person concerned. If this Member State confirms that the person is still a beneficiary of international protection, expulsion from the second Member State will only be possible to the Member State which originally granted the protection to the person concerned. However, both cases of readmission should be without prejudice to the provisions of Article 21(2) of Directive 2004/83/EC, regarding the exceptions to the protection from refoulement. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the necessary information exchange between Member States, Article 25 should be amended accordingly so as to allow the use of the network of national contact points also for that purpose. On a final point, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark are not bound by Directive 2003/109/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Initiative of Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Finland and Sweden for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 82(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) provides that judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Union shall be based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions. According to the Stockholm programme, adopted by the European Council at its meeting in December 2009, mutual recognition could extend to all types of judgments and decisions of a judicial nature, which may, depending on the legal system, be either criminal or administrative. The programme also underlines that victims of crime can be offered special protection measures which should be effective within the Union. The resolution of the European Parliament of 2 February 2006 on the current situation in combating violence against women and any future actions recommends that Member States formulate a zero-tolerance policy as regards all forms of violence against women and calls on Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure better protection of and support to actual and potential victims. In a common area of justice without internal borders, it is necessary to ensure that the protection provided to a person in one Member State is continued in any other Member State to which the person moves. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: various policy options have been examined: · Option A : No new action to be taken in the European Union. · Option B : Non-legislative measures , whose basic aim would be to establish a mechanism for exchanging information and good practices. · Option C : Legislative proposals to amend Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions, and Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA on the application between Member States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention. Amended versions of those Framework Decisions could incorporate a protection mechanism for those cases where it is the victim who moves to a State other than the one which adopted the measure. · Option D : Legislative proposal comprising a single text covering all scenarios relating to the extension of victim protection. In the light of the impact assessment, the repercussions for fundamental rights and the need to have an effective victim protection instrument at European level, options C and D offer the best ways to deal with the issue and could meet the objectives identified in full. The preferred option would be option D in the light of the legislative consequences of existing instruments, the need for clarity when applying new legislative texts and the usefulness of having a legislative text specifically designed to deal with victim protection across borders. CONTENT : this Directive sets out rules whereby the protection stemming from a protection measure adopted according to the law of one Member State (""the issuing State"") can be extended to another Member State to which the protected person moves (""the executing State""), regardless of the type or duration of the obligations or prohibitions contained in the protection measure concerned. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: ""European protection order "" is defined as a judicial decision relating to a protection measure issued by a Member State and aiming at facilitating the taking by another Member State, where appropriate, of a protection measure under its own national law with a view to the safeguard of the life, physical and psychological integrity, freedom or sexual integrity of a person. Scope of the European protection order : a European protection order may be issued at any moment when the protected person intends to leave or has left the issuing State for another Member State. It shall only be issued when a protection measure has been previously adopted in the issuing State, imposing on the person causing danger one or more of the following obligations or prohibitions: · an obligation not to enter certain localities, places or defined areas where the protected person resides or that he visits; · an obligation to remain in a specified place, where applicable during specified times; · an obligation containing limitations on leaving the territory of the issuing State; · an obligation to avoid contact with the protected person; or · a prohibition on approaching the protected person closer than a prescribed distance. Obligation to recognise the European protection order : Member States must recognise any European protection order in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. The latter shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the TEU. Designation of competent authorities : each Member State must inform the Council which judicial authority or authorities are competent under its national law to issue a European protection order and to recognise such an order, when that Member State is the issuing State or the executing State. Member States may designate non-judicial authorities as the competent authorities for taking decisions under the Directive, provided that such authorities have the competence to take decisions of a similar nature under their national law and procedures. Issue of a European protection order : on the basis of a protection measure adopted in the issuing State, a judicial authority of that State, or another competent authority as above, shall, only at the request of the protected person, issue a European protection order, after verifying that the protection measure meets all the requirements set out in the text. The protected person or his legal representative may submit a request for the issuance of a European protection order either to the competent authority of the issuing State or to the competent authority of the executing State. If such a request is submitted in the executing State, its competent authority shall transfer this request as soon as possible to the competent authority of the issuing State in order to issue the order. Form and content : the European protection order will be in accordance with the form set out in Annex I to the Directive. The information it must contain is prescribed in the text and includes the identity and nationality of the protected person, a summary of the facts and circumstances which have led to the imposition of the protection measure in the issuing State, and the identity and nationality of the person causing a danger. Transmission procedure : the text states that where the competent authority of the issuing State transmits the European protection order to the competent authority of the executing State, it shall do so by any means which leaves a written record so as to allow the competent authority of the executing Member State to establish its authenticity. Measures in the executing State : the proposal describes the series of actions that must be taken in the executing State, including informing the person causing danger, where appropriate, of any measure taken in the executing State. Grounds for non-recognition of a European protection order : these include the following: the European protection order is not complete or has not been completed within the time-limit set by the competent authority of the executing State; the requirements set out in Article 2 on scope have not been met; the protection derives from the execution of a penalty or measure that is covered by amnesty according to the law of the executing State and relates to an act which falls within its competence according to that law; there is immunity conferred under the law of the executing State on the person causing danger, which makes it impossible to adopt the protection measures; Subsequent decisions in the issuing State: the issuing State will have jurisdiction to take all subsequent decisions relating to the protection measure underlying a European protection order, notably the renewal, review and withdrawal of the protection measure, and the initiation of new criminal proceedings against the person causing the danger. Grounds for revoking the recognition of a European protection order : this may happen where there is evidence that the protected person has definitively left the territory of the executing State. Governing law: decisions made by the competent authority of the executing State shall be governed by its national law. Languages: the European protection order shall be translated into the official language or one of the official languages of the executing State. Costs: costs resulting from the application of the Directive shall be borne by the executing State, except for costs arising exclusively within the territory of the issuing State. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this proposal for a Directive will not impose any major additional expenditure on Member States' budgets or, as already stated, on the European Union budget. In the long term, the costs which it may involve, relating mainly to the translation of the European Protection Order, will in many instances represent savings by preventing the commission of new offences against the victim, that being the primary objective of this proposal."

It is reasonable to estimate from the available figures that every year several hundred thousand people are trafficked into the EU or within the EU area. The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings provides a comprehensive and coherent framework covering prevention, cooperation between different actors, protection of and assistance to victims, and an obligation to criminalise trafficking in human beings. Implementing such measures would lead to significant improvements. The Convention has been ratified by 16 EU Member States. Another 10 have signed it and are going through the ratification process. Framework Decision 2002/629/EC on combating trafficking in human beings was adopted in 2002 as a response to a generally perceived need to address the serious criminal offence of trafficking in human beings at EU level. In order to tackle recent developments in the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings, the proposed Directive adopts a broader concept of what should be considered trafficking in human beings than under Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA and therefore includes additional forms of exploitation. The fight against trafficking in human beings requires coordinated efforts by Member States, as well as cooperation at an international level in order to achieve the aims. Differences in legal treatment in the different Member States hinder coordinated efforts and hamper international law enforcement and judicial cooperation. It is necessary to repeal the 2002 text. It should be noted that this proposal builds on a Commission proposal made on 25/03/2009 aiming to repeal the 2002 Framework Decision which has lapsed following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: various policy options were examined in connection with the previous proposal for a Framework Decision of 25 March 2009 with a view to preventing and combating trafficking in human beings more effectively, and better protecting victims. This is valid for the current proposal. Option 1 : no new EU action. Option 2 : non legislative measures: Framework Decision 2004/629/JHA would not be amended. Non-legislative measures could be put in place in the areas of victim support schemes, monitoring, prevention measures in countries of destination, prevention measures in countries of origin, training, and law enforcement cooperation. Option 3 : new legislation on prosecution, victim support, prevention and monitoring. This would incorporate the provision of the existing Framework Directive, along with certain provisions of the Council of Europe’s Convention and additional elements, particularly provisions in the areas of substantive criminal law, jurisdiction and prosecution, victims' rights in criminal proceedings, victim assistance, special protective measures for children, prevention, and monitoring. Option 4 : new legislation (as in option 3) + non legislative measures (as in option 2). A new legislative act would be adopted, incorporating the existing Framework Directive and including new provisions. The new legislative act would be supplemented by non-legislative measures, and in particular those identified in option 2. Following the analysis of economic impacts, social impacts, and impacts on fundamental rights, options 3 and 4 present the best approach to the problem and should fully achieve the identified objectives. The preferred option is option 4. LEGAL BASIS: Article 82(2) and Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The fight against trafficking in human beings requires coordinated efforts by Member States, as well as cooperation at an international level in order to achieve the aims. Differences in legal treatment in the different Member States hinder coordinated efforts and hamper international law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Action by the EU will better achieve the objectives of the proposal, which will approximate Member States' substantive criminal law and procedural rules more extensively than the current Framework Decision. This will have a positive impact on international law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and on the protection and assistance given to victims. The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of trafficking in human beings. It also aims to introduce common provisions to strengthen the prevention of the crime and the protection of its victims. The new directive, in addition to provisions in the current Framework Decision, would include the following new elements: Substantive criminal law provisions : these comprise definition; aggravating circumstances and penalties: the proposal sets out precise level of penalties adapted to the severity of the offences. An offence under this legislation is punishable by penalties of a maximum of at least five years of imprisonment, and ten years for aggravating circumstances; non application of penalties to the victim: Member States must provide for the possibility of not prosecuting or imposing penalties on victims of trafficking in human beings for their involvement in criminal activities they have been compelled to commit as a direct consequence of being subjected to any of the acts referred to in text. Jurisdiction and prosecution broader and more binding extraterritorial jurisdiction rule, obliging Member States to prosecute nationals and habitual residents who have committed the crime of trafficking outside the territory of the Member State; investigative tools- those responsible for investigating such offences should have access to the investigative tools used in organised crime or other serious crime cases such as interception of communications, covert surveillance including electronic surveillance, monitoring of bank accounts and other financial investigations. Victim assistance and support establishment of mechanisms for early identification and assistance of victims; standard of assistance including access to necessary medical treatment, counselling, and psychological assistance; special measures for child victims of trafficking. Protection of victims in criminal proceedings special treatment aimed at preventing secondary victimisation; protection on the basis of a risk assessment; legal counselling and representation, including for the purpose of claiming compensation. Prevention action aimed at discouraging the demand for sexual services and cheap labour; regular training for officials likely to come into contact with victims and potential victims; criminalisation of users of services exacted from a person, when the user knows that the person has been trafficked. Monitoring : establishment of National Rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms. The tasks of such mechanisms shall include the carrying out of assessments on trafficking in human beings trends, the measuring of results of anti-trafficking actions and reporting to the relevant national authorities. Territorial scope : the adoption of the proposal will be addressed to the Member States. The application of the resulting Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols (No 21) and (No 22) annexed to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: e xperience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the findings of the group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière, the European Commission has piloted a fundamental overhaul of financial supervision in Europe with the objective of establishing a more efficient, integrated and sustainable European system of supervision. The Group presented its report on 25 February 2009 and its recommendations were endorsed by the Commission in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009. The key elements of the reform proposed by the Commission are : the establishment of a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees in a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board ( ESRB ), which shall monitor and assess potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. In its Communication of 27 May 2009, the Commission proposed that a European Supervisory Authority should be given the responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of certain entities with pan-European reach, e.g., credit rating agencies. These responsibilities would be defined in the Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on Credit Rating Agencies of the European Parliament and of the Council ( Credit rating Agencies Regulation ). The Commission's suggestion was endorsed by the European Council, at its meeting in June 2009, stating clearly that ESMA should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. The European Parliament and the Council requested the Commission to put forward, by 1 July 2010, a report and any legislative proposal needed to tackle the shortcomings identified as regards supervisory coordination and cooperation arrangements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed several options: Option 1: status quo : the key elements of the current supervisory set-up, agreed in the course of the negotiation of the CRA Regulation, would be maintained; Option 2: college structure and ESMA : the ESMA Regulation is adopted as proposed by the Commission on 23 September 2009 and that the supervisory framework as provided by the current CRA Regulation is maintained; Option 3 - ESMA to assume direct oversight of groups of CRAs or all EU-based CRAs : the CRA Regulation would be revised in order to introduce centralised oversight of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Option 3a: ESMA's authority would be limited to the supervision of CRAs (groups of CRAs) with legal presence in more than one Member State. Option 3b: ESMA would be the sole supervisor of all EU-based CRAs. The European Commission therefore considers that it is appropriate to present a proposal amending the Regulation on credit rating agencies. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the TFEU. Community action can address the weaknesses highlighted by the crisis and provide a system that is in line with the objective of a stable and single EU financial market for financial services. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on Credit Rating Agencies which is to be revised in order to introduce centralised oversight of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. ESMA is to assume general competence in matters relating to the registration and on-going supervision of registered credit rating agencies as well as matters related to ratings issued by rating agencies established in third countries that operate in the EU under the certification or endorsement regimes. This proposal does not introduce any changes to the Regulation on credit rating agencies concerning the substantive conditions that CRAs have to fulfil in order to be registered and later on an ongoing basis. Similarly, the conditions under which ratings issued from credit rating agencies located in third countries may be used in the Union (via the endorsement and certification mechanisms, as foreseen in the CRA Regulation) are not subject of the proposed amendments but will remain as provided for in the current CRA Regulation. The main amendments proposed are the following: Subject matter, scope and definitions: in order to align the Regulation with the new proposal for a Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers, alternative investment funds have been listed in order to treat them in the same way as the other EU financial institutions with regard to the use of credit ratings. This implies that in case alternative investment funds use credit ratings for regulatory purposes, those credit ratings must have been issued by a credit rating agency registered or certified under this Regulation. Issuing of Credit Ratings : in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest arising for the CRA under the issuer-pays model which are particularly virulent regarding the rating of structured finance instruments, to enhance transparency and to increase competition among CRAs, issuers of structured finance instruments or related third parties should be required to give access to the information which they have given to the CRA they hired for the purpose of rating structured finance instruments to competing CRAs. Provided they satisfy certain organisational and confidentiality conditions, competing CRAs should be given access, upon request, by the rated entity or a related third party to the information given for the purposes of rating structured finance instruments to the CRAs it hires. The competing CRA being granted access to information should not use it for any other purposes than for the rating and should be required to provide a minimum number of unsolicited ratings, in order to ensure that the request for access to this information does not pursue other purposes. Contrasting to the other substantive requirements in the CRA Regulation which are addressed to credit rating agencies and its staff, this rule imposes disclosure requirements to issuers of structured finance instruments. All registered credit rating agencies will have the possibility to access the information necessary for issuing unsolicited ratings of structured finance instruments. This will lead to more competition in the rating market and increase the number of ratings per instrument so that users of ratings will be able to rely on more than one rating for the same instrument. Registration procedure : as a result of introduction of the new, single supervisory authority for the oversight of credit rating agencies, existing provisions, which envisage a college type of supervisory coordination and ultimate, formal decision-making by a competent authority of the home Member State, are to be eliminated. The creation of ESMA will improve and streamline the procedure for registration, making it simpler (as a result of eliminating redundant consultation steps between authorities in the college and with CESR) and thus it is possible to reduce the time limits in the different stages of the registration process. Surveillance by ESMA: in order to facilitate day-to-day application of the Regulation, ESMA should be empowered to propose draft technical standards to be endorsed by the Commission on: i) the registration process, including on the information set out in Annex II; ii) the information that the credit rating agency must provide for the application for certification and for the assessment of its systemic importance to the financial stability or integrity of financial markets; and iii) the presentation of the information, including structure, format, method and period of reporting, that credit rating agencies shall disclose. ESMA is to be empowered to require all necessary information from CRAs and other persons related to credit rating activity. It will be able to start investigations into the potential breaches of the Regulation and in the remit of those it must be able to exercise supervisory powers such as examining records and other relevant material and taking copies/extracts thereof, requiring oral explanations, hearing a person, requiring records of telephone and data traffic. The ESMA must also be able to conduct on-site inspections. The rights of defence of the persons concerned shall be fully respected in the proceedings. In particular, ESMA must give the persons concerned the opportunity of being heard on the matters to which ESMA has taken objection. Cooperation between ESMA and competent authorities : competent authorities are to keep the oversight responsibilities regarding the use of credit ratings by the supervised entities (like credit institutions, or insurance undertakings) which employ those credit ratings for regulatory purposes. National supervisory authorities must also contribute to the supervisory activity of ESMA, by ensuring all necessary information exchange and co-operation, which may be required in the exercise of supervisory and enforcement powers of ESMA. Where necessary or appropriate for reasons of efficiency, in its supervisory activity ESMA must be able to seek the assistance of a competent supervisory authority at national level. Assistance by competent authorities should be provided when ESMA is carrying out investigations and on site inspections. ESMA may also delegate specific supervisory tasks to competent national authorities. Possible tasks that may be delegated include the carrying out of specific investigatory tasks and on-site inspections, the assessment of an application for registration, but also tasks related to day-to-day supervision. Delegation of tasks will not affect the responsibility of ESMA which may give instructions to the authority to which it has delegated a task. Penalties, Committee procedure and reporting: ESMA may propose to the Commission to impose periodic penalty payments. This coercive measure is to help achieve that: i) an infringement is put to an end, ii) complete and correct information which ESMA has requested is supplied; iii) credit rating agencies and other persons submit to an investigation. ESMA may also propose fines to be adopted by the Commission, where, intentionally or negligently, some of the provisions of the Regulation on credit rating agencies have been breached. Detailed criteria for establishing the amount of the fines as well as procedural aspects related to fines will be set out in a delegated act. In addition to proposing sanctions, ESMA shall also be empowered to adopt supervisory measures where a credit rating agency has committed a breach of the Regulation. Those measures include the temporary prohibition of the issuing of credit ratings and the suspension of the use of the credit ratings concerned until the infringement has been put to an end. As a last resort measure, ESMA is empowered to withdraw the registration of a credit rating agency. In addition, ESMA has the power to require the credit ratings agencies to bring an infringement to an end and to issue public notices. Those measures shall be applied in cases which do not justify the adoption of a sanction or more severe supervisory measure, taking account of the principle of proportionality. The committee procedures have been aligned with the Lisbon Treaty. Transitional and final provisions : once ESMA will be in place and operational, the competent authorities of the Member States will have to terminate their competences and duties related to the supervisory and enforcement activity in the field of credit rating agencies which had been conferred to them by the Regulation on credit rating agencies. BUDGETARY IMPACT: an overall overview of the budgetary implications of the proposals setting up ESMA was presented in September 2009 in the impact assessment report and accompanying legislative financial statements accompanying such legislative proposals (see the legislative financial statement added to the proposal on the setting up of the European Securities Markets Authority). The specific implications on ESMA concerning the direct supervision and oversight of credit rating agencies are specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. The impact for the 2011-2013 are the following: Operating appropriations: EUR1.001 million Human resources and other administrative expenditure: EUR 1.464 million Total appropriations: EUR 2.465 million. The proposal provides for co-funding estimated at EUR 1.501 million in 2011 (60% of total needs by Member States, via EU National Supervisors –proposed ESMA standard financing mechanism)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the proposal concerns the following 8 metrology Directives: Directive 75/33/EEC on Cold Water Meters for Non-Clean Water; Directives 76/765/EEC and 76/766/EEC on Alcohol Meters and Alcohol Tables; Directives 71/317/EEC and 74/148/EEC on Medium and Above-Medium Accuracy Weights respectively; Directive 86/217/EEC on Tyre Pressure Gauges for Motor Vehicles; Directive 71/347/EEC on Standard Mass of Grain; Directive 71/349/EEC on Calibration of Ship Tanks. From the public consultation and an external study, it appears that there are no obstacles to trade in the 6 sectors covered by the 8 old approach Directives. It is also apparent that the Directives concern instruments increasingly less in use. Technical progress and innovation with regard to measuring instruments covered by the Directives being repealed is ensured in practice either by the voluntary application of the international and European standards which have been developed or by the application of national provisions implementing such new specifications. Furthermore, the free circulation within the internal market of all products concerned by them is ensured by the satisfactory application of Articles 28 to 30 of the EC Treaty and of the mutual recognition principle. The repeal of the Directives should not lead to any new barriers to the free movement or to additional administrative burdens. Furthermore, while respecting the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity, there is no evidence of a common need for a higher level of consumer protection. The repeal of the Directives should not affect existing EEC pattern approvals and EEC certificates until the end of their validity."

Members consider that energy efficiency and savings are the most cost-effective and fastest way to reduce CO2 and other emissions and increase security of supply. Academic evidence clearly supports the view that efforts need to be stepped up, including at the regional and the local level to reach the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, as at current rates of progress only around half of this target would be met by 2020, even though practices and technologies to achieve this target already exist. 1) Compliance with and implementation of existing legislation: Parliament calls on Member States, local authorities, and especially on the Commission, to give energy efficiency the attention it deserves, and put in place resources (staffing and finance) which match their ambitions. It points out that energy efficiency should be integrated into all relevant policy areas, including finance, regional and urban development, transport, agriculture, industrial policy and education. The Commission is invited to present in sufficient time before the 4th of February 2011 Energy Summit, within its revised Energy Efficiency Action Programme (EEAP), an evaluation of the implementation of the existing legislation. Members consider that the new Energy Action Plan 2011-2020 should be presented as soon as possible, and energy efficiency should have an important role in the future Roadmap towards a low-carbon energy system and economy by 2050. They invite the European Union to adopt a binding target on energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020, and thereby advance the transition into a sustainable and green economy. According to Members, the EEAP should be ambitious and focus on the full energy supply chain, which takes stock of the progress achieved with all measures contained in the 2006 Action Plan which are still under way, and includes additional measures which are cost-efficient and adequate principles. Parliament calls on the Commission to design the new EEAP taking into account the needs of vulnerable energy consumers and to promote measures to raise the level of awareness for and the know-how of energy efficiency issues among all relevant stakeholders and all professional actors involved at all stages. The resolution calls for a revision of the Energy Services Directive (ESD) in 2011 that includes an expanded time framework until 2020, a critical assessment of National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and their implementation, including common standards for reporting. Member States are urged to implement quickly and efficiently market surveillance and compliance-monitoring programmes for Directive establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products, Directive on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products, and Regulation on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters. 2) Energy infrastructure (production and transmission): Members consider that a stronger focus is needed on system innovations such as smart grids (for electricity but also for heating and cooling), smart metering, gas networks integrating biogas and energy storage. Parliament underlines that an explicit and comprehensive strategy for heat generation and use (industrial heat, domestic heating, cooling) is needed. It is noted that improvements to the energy efficiency of the housing stock will lead to a reduction in heat demand which should be factored in when assessing district heating capacity. Members stress the fact that second to energy efficiency at the source (i.e. in primary energy production), tackling losses of (electrical) energy during transport through the grids should be considered a priority. They call for a revision of Directive 2004/8/EC (known as the CHP Directive) to promotehighly efficient combined heat and power (CHP), Micro-CHP, use of waste heat from industry, and district heating/cooling systems. Member States are called upon, not only to support high efficiency industrial CHP generation, including by changing from fossil fuel to biomass, but also, for those which have of district heating infrastructure, to promote the use of CHP by supporting the establishment and refurbishment of district heating systems through appropriate financing and regulatory measures. The Commission is asked to support and promote the setting up and development of a European high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid able to optimise the harnessing of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and hydropower. 3) Urban development and buildings: noting that buildings are responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and about 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, Parliament calls on the Commission to assess the potential for efficiency in existing buildings starting with public administration buildings including schools and propose a cost-efficient target for the reduction of the primary energy consumption of buildings. For their part, Member States are called upon to implement practicable programmes to support deep renovations by which the energy demand will initially be reduced by more than 50% over pre-renovation performance. The resolution asks that Member States should be required to include set annual refurbishment targets in their national action plans on Energy Efficiency and calls on the Commission to propose policy options on how to achieve a nearly zero level building stock in the context of the 2050 energy roadmap. Parliament believes it is essential that the homes of energy poor households are improved to the highest possible energy efficiency standards and without raising the daily costs for the energy poor. It is also convinced that it is key for achieving the energy savings target that public authorities at national, regional and local level lead the way. It calls on public authorities to go well beyond the requirements set in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, in particular by renovating their existing stock as early as possible to a level comparable to nearly zero energy standard, where technically and economically feasible. It adds that the EU institutions and agencies should set an example, in particular in those buildings that have been identified as having an energy efficiency potential, by refurbishing these buildings in a cost-efficient manner to nearly zero level by 2019 as part of a wider audit of energy use by the institutions. Acknowledging the potential of energy savings in buildings, both in cities and rural areas, Parliament calls for innovative solutions to removing barriers to energy refurbishments, such as district refurbishment plans, financial incentives and technical assistance. It stresses that EU schemes should provide incentives for retrofitting buildings to go beyond the minimum legal requirements and address only buildings with an energy efficiency potential. The resolution calls on the Member States to accelerate the introduction of Energy Performance Certificates which are issued in an independent manner by qualified and/or accredited experts, as well as to create one-stop shops providing access to technical advice and support as well as financial incentives available at regional, national and European level. It also asks the Commission to propose energy benchmarks or requirements with regard to the installation of street lighting by public authorities including the use of smarter controls and energy saving use patterns by 2012. Parliament urges Member States to systematically use energy efficient public procurement practices. It takes the view that defining energy efficiency systematically as an award criterion in public procurement and making it a condition for publicly funded projects would give this policy a major push. 4) ICT and products: Parliament calls for the rapid and proper implementation of the Directives on Ecodesign and Energy Labelling and regrets current long delays. It suggests clearer and stricter deadlines for adoption, by proposing implementing or respectively delegated acts covering new energy-related products. Members believe that the Ecodesign Directive should cover more products including, if appropriate, new household appliances, ICT, energy-related products for use in buildings (such as industrial electrical motors, machinery, air conditioning, heat exchangers, heating and lighting equipment and pumps), industrial and agricultural equipment, building materials, and products for the efficient use of water. The resolution calls on the Commission to combine existing European legislation such as the Eco-Design-Directive and the Energy Labelling Directive, in order to implement EU legislation most efficiently and make use of synergies, especially for the consumer. Parliament also considers that legislation should address products, systems and their energy use. It regards it as necessary to increase the awareness of EU citizens including relevant sales professionals, regarding the energy and resource efficiency of consumer and energy-related products. The resolution insists that more emphasis should be given to an analysis of the consequences of energy efficiency standards. Members find, in this context, that uniform technical standards are the appropriate means of achieving higher market penetration for energy efficient products. Parliament emphasises that Europe should be at the cutting edge in the development of energy related Internet and ICT low-carbon technologies and applications. It acknowledges the need to support partnerships between the ICT sector and major emitting sectors to improve the energy efficiency and emissions of these sectors. For smart metering to be a success, members consider it is crucial to inform society of its benefits. Members call on the Commission to put forward a number of recommendations before the end of 2011 to ensure, among other things, that: smart metering is implemented in accordance with the timetable of the 3rd Energy Market Package so that the objective of having 80% of buildings fitted with smart meters by 2020 will be met; Member States agree by the end of 2011 on minimum common functionalities for smart meters; there should be smart meter benefits for consumers, such as energy reductions; Member States develop and publish a strategy to deliver the potential benefit of smart metering to all consumers, including vulnerable and low income people. 5) Transport: the Commission is called to publish an ambitious white paper on transport in order to develop a sustainable European transport policy that promotes the introduction of energy-efficient new technologies and reduces dependency on fossil fuels. Parliament considers that all tools, including vehicle and fuel taxation, labelling, minimum efficiency standards and measures to improve and favour public transportation, are urgently needed in order to address transport emissions. It reiterates the need to promote inter-modal transport solutions, as well as the development of intelligent transport systems in order to achieve energy savings in the transport sector. The Commission is called upon to: present by the end of 2011 a strategy for lowering the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of heavy duty vehicles; consider adopting a single mandatory pan-European system of labelling for passenger vehicles and to examine the possibility of extending this proposed single labelling system to include electric and hybrid vehicles; ensure comparable framework conditions for the development of electric vehicles and for the development of vehicles using fuel cells or other more sustainable energy sources. The resolution asks Member States to abolish tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-inefficient cars and replace them with tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-efficient cars. 6) Incentives and financing: Parliament considers that the Commission should put forward proposals on how to establish an EU framework of revolving financial instruments to support or guarantee complementary energy efficiency measures, existing national schemes and distribution channels (e.g. by means of risk sharing) and to encourage the setting-up and improvement of energy efficiency schemes in Member States. The Commission is called upon to propose, within the EEAP, policy options on how to ensure that energy efficiency funds are in place at national, regional or local level. Members consider that these funds could, through financial intermediaries, play an important role in the development of such instruments, which would deliver financing possibilities to private property owners, SMEs and energy service companies (ESCOs).  Members welcome the support given in the Europe 2020 Strategy to shifting the tax burden to energy and environmental taxes which can create incentives to consumers and the industry for energy efficiency and job creation. They invite the Member States to consider the possibility to reduce VAT rates for energy efficiency refurbishment works. Members call on the Commission to submit an annual report on whether and how appropriate (fiscal and subsidy-linked) incentives at national level might be created, such as, in the private sphere and in SMEs, depreciations of small-scale industrial equipment up to EUR 10 000 or, in the industrial sphere, progressive depreciations of 50% in the first year or the creation of appropriate investment incentives and of research subsidies, in order to push forward energy efficiency measures. The resolution also stresses the need to improve the use of existing EU funds such as the ERDF and EAFRD for energy efficiency measures. It calls for energy saving to be integrated into the conditionality for granting EU assistance and for consideration to be given to the possibility of directing a higher proportion of the national allocations toward energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. It calls on the Commission to use the mid term review in order to allocate more funds for energy efficiency programmes and to promote the possibility to use up to 15% of the ERDF for energy efficiency. Lastly, the Commission is called upon to make energy efficiency one of the key priorities of the 8th Framework Research Programme and to allocate a significant part to energy efficiency sub-programmes similar to the current Intelligent Energy Programme."

BACKGROUND: the Treaty of Lisbon substantially modifies the framework for implementing powers that are conferred upon the Commission by the legislator. Contrary to the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community (""the EC Treaty""), the new Treaty makes a clear distinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), on the one hand, and the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts, on the other hand. They are subject to entirely different legal frameworks: the provisions of the new Treaty on delegated acts, which are set out in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (""the Treaty""), provide for the legislator to control the exercise of the Commission's powers by means of a right of revocation and/or a right of objection. These provisions are sufficient in themselves and do not require any legally binding framework to make them operational. the provisions of the new Treaty on implementing acts, which are set out in Article 291, do not provide any role for the European Parliament and the Council to control the Commission's exercise of implementing powers. Such control can only be exercised by the Member States. A legal framework is required to establish the mechanisms of such control. The provisions of the new Treaty also put the co-legislators on an equal footing in relation to the conferral of delegated and implementing powers. Under the EC Treaty it was the Council that could confer implementing powers on the Commission. The Council could also reserve implementing powers to itself in specific cases. Under the new Treaty provisions it is a direct obligation deriving from the Treaty that acts must confer implementing powers on the Commission where this is needed in view of ensuring uniform implementation of these acts. Those acts can also, in duly justified specific cases and in the cases provided for in Articles 24 and 26 of the Treaty on European Union, confer implementing powers on the Council instead of the Commission. This does not imply, however, that the Council has any role in controlling the exercise of implementing powers when these are conferred on the Commission. The new Treaty clearly entails that it is the Member States, and they alone, that control the implementation by the Commission where such control is required by a legally binding Union act. As regards the implementation of Article 290 of the Treaty, the Commission has set out its views on the scope of delegated acts in a Communication. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 291(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal is guided by the new provisions of the Treaty and the new institutional context described above. However, the proposal also draws on Council Decision 1999/468/EC (""the Comitology Decision"") and experience gained in implementing that Decision, whilst simplifying its provisions taking into account in particular the following general principles: (i) it is the Member States that are responsible for controlling the Commission's exercise of implementing powers; and (ii) procedural requirements should be proportionate to the nature of implementing acts. The key elements of the proposal that include similarities and innovations in comparison with the ‘Comitology’ Decision are as follows: - the proposal maintains the Committee structure provided for in the Comitology Decision (Article 3), but rationalises it ; there are only two procedures: the advisory procedure, which mirrors the existing advisory procedure, and a new examination procedure, which will replace - the existing management and regulatory procedures (Articles 4 and 5); the advisory procedure is the general rule and can be applied to all policy domains and for all types of binding implementing measures (Article 2(3)); - the criteria for the choice of the examination procedure mirror those provided for in the Comitology Decision. Nevertheless, these criteria are binding in the sense that only when the criteria are met can the examination procedure in question be used (Article 2(2)); - the examination procedure (Article 5): the main provisions are as follows: where the Committee delivers a negative opinion on the draft measures, the Commission may not adopt them. The Commission may re-submit the draft to the committee for a second deliberation, or table an amended draft. In very exceptional circumstances, the Commission would be able to adopt the draft measures despite a negative opinion but in such a case the committee would have the last word within a time-period which will not exceed one month; where no opinion is reached, the Commission may ultimately decide whether to adopt the measures or not, taking into account inter alia the positions expressed within the committee; in the case of a positive opinion of the committee, the Commission will adopt the measures unless exceptional circumstances or new elements justify them not being adopted. - there are specific procedures for measures to apply immediately on imperative grounds of urgency and where this is provided for in a basic act (Article 6); - the proposal maintains provisions relating to the rules of procedures of committees (Article 7) and regarding public access to information on committee proceedings (Article 8(3)); - building on experience gained with the implementation of the Comitology Decision, the proposal also includes a number of important provisions that are common practice but were not covered by the Decision. These include the provisions for the use of written procedures (Article 3 (5)) in order to obtain the committee's opinion and the possibility for amending draft measures in order to take into account discussions in the committee prior to it delivering its formal opinion (Article 3 (4)); - both legislators should be properly and continuously informed of committee proceedings through the continued use of the existing Comitology Register, which would be adapted to the new procedures; - lastly, for reasons of clarity, consistency and efficiency, the proposal provides for an automatic alignment of the existing acquis to the new procedures (Article 10). The adaptation to the new system will not affect pending procedures in which an opinion has already been delivered. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: The proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: in May 2003 the European Commission published an EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) which called for measures to address illegal logging through the development of voluntary partnership agreements with timber-producing countries. Council conclusions on that Action Plan were adopted in October 2003 and Parliament adopted a resolution on the subject on 11 July 2005. The Action Plan proposes a set of measures that include support for timber-producing countries, multilateral collaboration to tackle trade in illegal timber, support for private sector initiatives and measures to stop investment in activities that encourage illegal logging. The cornerstone of the Action Plan is the establishment of FLEGT partnerships between the European Union and timber-producing countries with the aim of stopping illegal logging. In 2005 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 which establishes a licensing scheme and a mechanism to verify the legality of timber imports into the European Union. It is against this background that the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cameroon on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber and derived products to the European Union (FLEGT) is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: first paragraphs of Article 207(3) and (4), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) and Article 218(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the partnership agreement with Cameroon is the third of its kind to be negotiated, after agreements with Ghana and the Republic of Congo. The Agreement addresses all the elements contained in the Council negotiating directives. In particular, the Agreement establishes the framework, institutions and systems for the FLEGT licensing scheme. It outlines: the supply chain controls, legal compliance framework; independent audit requirements for the system. These are set out in annexes to the Agreement which provide a detailed description of the structures that will underpin the assurance of legality offered by the issuance of a FLEGT licence. Cameroon developed its definition of the applicable legislation by means of extensive stakeholder consultations. It includes laws and regulations granting rights to harvest, forest management, environmental, business and labour legislation, fiscal requirements, respect for tenure and use rights of nearby communities and other social obligations laid down in forest laws, as well as regulations governing commercial activity and export trade requirements. The Agreement goes beyond the limited product coverage proposed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (‘the FLEGT Regulation’) to cover trade in all timber products and, in doing so, commits Cameroon to building a system that will provide assurance to the European Union that all forest products from Cameroon are legally harvested and produced and contributing positively and sustainably to Cameroon’s growth. The agreement also: provides for controls on imports at the European Union’s borders, as established by the FLEGT Regulation and the associated Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1024/2008; includes a description of the Cameroon FLEGT licence which adopts the format laid down in the Implementing Regulation; establishes the mechanism for dialogue and cooperation on FLEGT with the European Union, in the form of the Joint Implementation Council and a consultative body known as the Joint Monitoring Committee; establishes the principles of stakeholder participation, social safeguards and transparency for monitoring impacts and reporting. The Agreement sets out a time frame and the procedures for entry into force of the Agreement and for implementing the licensing scheme. Since Cameroon will upgrade and redesign its regulatory and information management system, introduce more comprehensive supply chain controls and establish independent verification of legal compliance, it will take several years to develop and test the new systems and to build capacity on the part of the government, civil society and the private sector for the tasks envisaged. The FLEGT licence scheme is expected to be fully operational by the beginning of 2012. The licence scheme will be assessed against defined criteria before the EU begins accepting FLEGT licences. The steps and process for this are defined in the Agreement and its annexes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the European Union concluded the deal with Latin American countries (Geneva Convention) and the US in December 2009 which settles 15 years of banana disputes. It also cuts the tariff which the EU applies to bananas imported from Latin American countries. With those two agreements, years of lengthy and complex negotiations where put to an end. With the Geneva Agreement entering into force, it is necessary to abolish the existing applied EU Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate for the importation of bananas by repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas which established the currently applied rate of EUR 176/tonne. In accordance with the Geneva Agreement, the Union will gradually reduce its banana tariff from EUR 176/tonne to EUR 114/tonne. A first cut, which was applied retroactively as of 15 December 2009, the date of initialling of the Agreement, reduced the tariff to EUR 148/tonne. The subsequent cuts are to apply in seven annual instalments with a possible delay of a maximum of two years if agreement on agriculture modalities in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is delayed. The final tariff of EUR 114/tonne is to be reached on 1 January 2019 at the latest. The tariff reductions will be bound in the WTO at the moment of the certification of the EU banana schedule. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Agreements reduce progressively the tariff rates for bananas. It can be estimated that these measures will lead to smaller own resources as follows: -EUR 3.5 million in 2009, -EUR 74.8million in 2010, - EUR 88.1 million in 2011, and -EUR 106.8 million in 2012. These are net amounts after deduction of collecting costs by Member States. An estimate of own resources for 2009 was included because of the retroactive validity of these Agreements to 15/12/2009."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) entered into force on 13 February 2003. Member States were required to transpose the requirements of the Directive by 13 August 2004. The extensive analysis carried out as part of the WEEE review process led to the identification of the following problems related to the application of the WEEE Directive: there is lack of clarity on the products covered by the current WEEE Directive and their categorisation, with different interpretations by different Member States and stakeholders; currently approximately 65% of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market is collected separately, but less than half of this is treated and reported according to the requirements of the Directive. The remainder potentially leaks out to substandard treatment and is illegally exported to third countries, including non-OECD countries. This leads to losses of valuable secondary raw materials and increases the risk of release of hazardous substances into the environment; the current collection rate, 4kg/inhabitant per year of WEEE from private households, (""one size fits all"") does not reflect the economies of individual Member States and thus leads to sub-optimal targets for some countries and too ambitious targets for others; currently there are no targets for the re-use of whole appliances in the Directive; there are no detailed enforcement requirements in the Directive, which results in lack of enforcement in Member States; there are diverging producer registration requirements in Member States; indications on substandard treatment of WEEE in the EU and illegal export of WEEE outside the EU are highlighted. The specific objectives of the review of the WEEE Directive are therefore: reduced administrative costs through the removal of all unnecessary administrative burdens, without lowering the level of environmental protection; improved effectiveness and implementation of the Directive through increased compliance and reduced free-riding; reduced impacts on the environment from the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE at the levels where the greatest net benefit to society results. The proposed measures are as follows: Scope : it is proposed to bring Annex IA and IB of Directive 2002/96/EC describing the scope for both the WEEE Directive and the Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS Directive) under the RoHS Directive, which is based on Article 95 of Treaty. The WEEE Directive, based on Article 175 of the EC Treaty, will refer to this scope. Clarification of definitions : clarification is proposed on the distinction between WEEE from private households (B2C) and non household WEEE (B2B) by classifying the equipment as either B2C or B2B through the comitology procedure. These actions will contribute to better clarification of which products fall under the WEEE Directive and will further clarify the obligations applying to different producers of equipment. Collection target : a 65% WEEE collection rate (including B2B equipment) is proposed which is set according to the average quantity of EEE placed on the market in the two preceding years. This target reflects the amounts of WEEE which are currently already collected separately in the Member States and takes the variations in EEE consumption in individual Member States into account. Therefore, it will encourage Member States to target an optimal rate of separate WEEE collection. The proposed collection rate should be achieved annually, starting in 2016. There are certain degrees of flexibility: possible transitional measures for Member States and a re-examination of the rate by the European Parliament and the Council in 2012, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. Recycling targets : in order to encourage the re-use of whole WEEEs, it is proposed to include the re-use of whole appliances in the increased target (by 5%) for recycling combined with re-use. The recycling target for medical devices (category 8 equipment) is proposed to be set at the same level as that for monitoring and control instruments (category 9 equipment). Producer registration : in order to reduce the administrative burden, the registration and reporting obligations for producers, which are specified by the different national producer registers, should be harmonised, including making the registers interoperable. Enforcement : in order to bridge the implementation gap, it is proposed to set minimum inspection requirements for Member States, in order to strengthen the enforcement of the WEEE Directive. Minimum monitoring requirements are proposed for shipments of WEEE."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the above-mentioned Agreement between the EC and its Member States and South Africa (‘TDCA’) entered into force on 1 May 2004. Articles 18 and 103 of the TDCA call for a review of the Agreement within five years of its entry into force. At its meeting of 7 November 2005, the Joint Cooperation Council established the broad lines of the future revision of the TDCA, covering further liberalisation of trade, minor adjustments to the Title on Development Cooperation, updating the wording of several provisions concerning economic cooperation and cooperation in other areas. On that basis, the Commission submitted a proposal for a negotiating mandate in June 2006. In November 2006 the Council adopted a two-tier Decision giving the Commission two mandates. One was to give guidance to the Commission for revising the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation on the basis of Article 106(1) of the TDCA, which gives the Cooperation Council the power to decide on amendments put forward by any Party. The other was to authorise the opening of negotiations between the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other, to revise the Agreement on matters relating to the political dimension of the Agreement and to justice, freedom and security. However, in the course of the negotiations, for the sake of consistency, both sides agreed to forego the ‘lighter’ procedure of Article 106(1) of the TDCA, and to negotiate a single Agreement amending the TDCA. Consequently, the Commission negotiated this Agreement on the basis of the combined negotiating directives adopted by the Council, and in consultation with the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Working Party and the Africa Working Group. These two bodies were appointed by the Council, according to their respective responsibilities, as the special committees to assist the Commission in its task. The TDCA negotiations on trade and trade-related matters were suspended pending the outcome of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations. Throughout the negotiations, the Commission ensured that due account was taken of the process for implementing the Strategic Partnership between South Africa and the EU. The agreement was signed on behalf of the Community and Member States on 11 September 2009 in Kleinmond, South Africa in accordance with Council Decision 7437/08. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218 (6) (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: following the entry into force of the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU is substituting the European Community for the approval of the agreement. As stipulated in Article 3 of the Agreement, the Parties shall notify each other of the completion of the corresponding approval procedures and the respective instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU. As established in Article 4, the Amending Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the month in which the Parties notify each other that the necessary procedures have been completed. The current proposal is for a Council Decision concluding the amending agreement. It contains new provisions on terrorism, the International Criminal Court, weapons of mass destruction, mercenaries and small arms. The Commission therefore recommends that the Council adopt the attached Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he market for international carriage of passengers by bus and coach has already been liberalised. This mode of transport is characterised by a number of distinctive features which affect both the operators and passengers. In passenger-kilometre terms, bus and coach transport holds a 9.3 % share of all land transport services within the European Union and, after passenger cars (82.8%), it remains the most important means of transportation available to the public (8.3 % share in all modes of transport).The sector has seen steady growth of 5.8% from 474 million in 1995 to 502 million in 2004. It is estimated that the annual volume of international bus and coach passengers amounts to 72.8 million passengers. In contrast to other modes of transport (notably air transport), there are neither international agreements (with the exception of the United Nations – Economic Commission for Europe Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Passengers and Luggage by Road (CVR), ratified by only three Member States) nor Community legislation establishing bus and coach passenger rights. Protection of bus and coach passengers varies from one Member State to another. Rules on liability of operators tend to vary significantly, while compensation and assistance in the event of interrupted journeys are not generalised. In its Communication of 22 June 2006, the Commission committed itself to examining how to increase quality of service and assurance of passenger rights in all modes of transport. With regard to coach transport, the Commission identified three main areas of concern: 1) the rights of persons with reduced mobility, 2) liability issues and 3) compensation and assistance in the event of interrupted travel. CONTENT: the proposal aims at establishing rights of coach and bus passengers in order to improve the attractiveness of and confidence in coach and bus transport as well as to achieve a level playing field between carriers from different Member States and between other modes of transport. In principle the proposal lays down provisions on: liability in the event of death or injury of passengers and loss of or damage to their luggage; non-discrimination on grounds of nationality or place of residence with regard to transport conditions offered to passengers by bus or coach undertakings, assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility; obligations of bus and coach undertakings in the event of cancellation or delay of a journey; information obligations; handling of complaints; general rules on enforcement. The proposal for a Regulation will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Treaty by ensuring an enhanced level of consumer protection, combating discrimination and social exclusion of persons with disabilities and allowing European citizens to take full advantage of the opportunities created by the internal market. Establishing and further strengthening the rights of passengers reflects the high priority given by the Amsterdam Treaty to the protection of consumers. The present proposal regarding the rights of passengers in bus and coach services is consistent with the objectives of combating social exclusion, as it establishes the principle of non-discrimination and assistance for disabled people. The proposal is also in line with Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it also ties in with Article 13 of the EC Treaty, which enables the Community to combat discrimination in the areas of Community competence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Light commercial vehicles are mainly used by businesses, including small and medium enterprises and currently light commercial vehicles make up around 12% of the fleet. The average reduction of CO2 emissions over 2002-2007 for light commercial vehicles amounted to 0.4-0.5% per year, and these very limited improvements in fuel efficiency have been offset by the increase in demand for transport and vehicle size. While the EU as a whole has reduced its emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by approximately 9% over the 1990- 2007 period and emissions have been declining in non-transport sectors, the CO2 emissions from transport have increased by 29%. Despite significant improvements in vehicle motor technology, in particular in fuel efficiency which also means lower CO2 emissions, demand for transport and vehicle size has increased and progress has been too slow in view of the overall Community objective of average new passenger car emissions of 120 g CO2/km. Adopting Community targets for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent fragmentation in the internal market resulting from the adoption of different measures at Member State level. Furthermore, setting CO2  emission standards for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent a risk of regulatory gap resulting from certain overlap between the registrations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Furthermore, on 28 June 2007 the Council invited the Commission to come forward with a proposal on the improvement of fuel efficiency from light commercial vehicles. Lastly, it is important to encourage the automotive sector to invest in new technologies. The proposal will put in place a concrete measure to deliver on the targets and will therefore strengthen the EU's leadership position on climate change in the run-up to the United Nations Climate Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment investigated five main options: Options 1 and 2 : to define a linear curve giving the CO2  value to be achieved by a given vehicle as a function of its ""utility"" (mass) so that the average of the new light commercial vehicles in (1) 2012 and (2) 2013-2015 would deliver the 175 g CO2/km target. Options 3 and 4: based on the same target (175 g CO2/km) and years (respectively. 2012 and 2013-2015), but on the basis of a linear curve defining the CO2 value to be achieved as a function of an alternative ""utility"", namely pan area. Option 5: to require manufacturers to deliver a set percentage reduction corresponding to the reduction needed to achieve the 175 g CO2/km target in 2012-2015 compared to the 2007 situation. The impact assessment considered different flexibility mechanisms, including fleet averaging and pooling, as well as a compliance mechanism. In addition to the five policy options, several levels of the long-term target (ranging from 160 to 125 g CO2/km for year 2020) were analysed. CONTENT: the proposal is a follow-up of the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles and complements Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 (which sets CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars). It aims to reduce the impact of light-duty vehicles on the climate by ensuring that, from 1 July 2013, the average specific emissions of new light commercial vehicles registered in the Community do not exceed 175 g CO2/km. This target will be phased in gradually from 1 January 2014 onwards with full compliance of the new light commercial fleet from 2016. The starting date for the CO2  emissions standard for light commercial vehicles is consistent with the timeframe of the adoption by the Commission of the proposal for a regulation setting similar standards for passenger cars as of 2012. This indicates entry into force of the standard for light commercial vehicles from 2014. Further to the inclusion of the long-term target of 95 g/km as of 2020 in Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, this proposal sets a target of 135 g/km for light commercial vehicles to be achieved from 2020 subject to confirmation of its feasibility on the basis of updated impact assessment results. The key aspects of the proposal are: it will apply to light commercial vehicles of category N1, with a reference mass not exceeding 2610kg and vehicles to which type-approval is extended in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2007. N2 and M2 vehicles with a reference mass meeting the above criteria will be included for monitoring purposes and their full inclusion in the scheme will be considered during a review; it sets targets for the specific emissions of CO2  from new light commercial vehicles in the Community as a function of their mass. The targets will apply to the average specific emissions of CO2  in g/km for new light commercial vehicles for each manufacturer which are registered in the EU in each calendar year. Manufacturers may form a pool in order to meet their targets. Where two or more manufacturers form a pool, the pool will be treated as if it is one manufacturer for the purposes of determining its compliance with the targets; it includes incentives for early market deployment of low emitting light commercial vehicles by granting them super-credits on an interim basis; it includes provisions to promote eco-innovations (i.e. CO2-reducing technologies that are not captured by the test-cycle during which CO2  emissions are measured). Under this provision up to 7 g/km can be deducted from the average of a manufacturer’s specific CO2  emissions for innovative technologies which reduce emissions, based on independently verified data; Member States will be obliged to collect data on the new light commercial vehicles registered in their territory and to report this data to the Commission for the purposes of assessing compliance with the targets; if a manufacturer fails to meet its target, it will be required to pay an excess emissions premium. The premium will be calculated by multiplying the number of g CO2/km by which the manufacturer exceeded its target by the number of vehicles newly registered and by the excess emissions premium calculated as a function of the year and distance to target. The targets under the Regulation are established on the basis of the best knowledge currently available regarding, in particular, the likely fleet evolution between now and 2014 in respect of the 'autonomous weight increase'. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the implementation of the proposed Regulation will be carried out together with that of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 on CO2  from passenger cars as both share many features like, for example, the monitoring of manufacturers' performance against their CO2  reduction targets and, where necessary, the administration of excess emissions premiums provided for in the legislation. Expenditure already foreseen under the LIFE+ programme is considered sufficient, in particular because of the limited size of the market for light commercial vehicles compared to that for passenger cars. Therefore, this new proposal for CO2  emissions from light-duty vehicles would not require additional financial resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: on 1 August 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the Community patent. It proposed the creation of a unitary Community patent which would co-exist with national patents granted by national patent offices of the Member States and European patents granted under the European Patent Convention (EPC) by the European Patent Office (EPO). The proposal was extensively discussed in the meetings of the Council, but failed to reach the required unanimity in particular because of the language arrangements. On 3 March 2003, the Council adopted a common political approach on the Community patent. This provided that patent proprietors would have to supply translations of the claims into all the official languages of the Member States. This arrangement was rejected by all users of the patent system as too costly and too risky. The Council concluded that due to the issue of the translation regime it was unable to reach a political agreement on the proposed Regulation on the Community Patent. Discussions in the Council were re-launched after adoption of the Commission Communication ""Enhancing the patent system in Europe"" in April 2007. In December 2009, the Council adopted conclusions on an ""Enhanced patent system for Europe"" and a general approach on the proposal for a Regulation on the EU Patent. However, the translation arrangements for the EU patent remained out of the scope of these Council conclusions due to the change of the legal basis for the creation of the EU patent under the Lisbon Treaty. On this basis, on 30 June 2010, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the EU patent without obtaining the required unanimity of the Council of Ministers of the EU. On 10 December 2010, the Council that insurmountable difficulties existed, making a decision requiring unanimity impossible now and in the foreseeable future. It follows that the objectives of the proposed Regulations to establish unitary patent protection in the entire European Union can not be attained within a reasonable period by applying the relevant provisions of the Treaties. Twelve Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have addressed formal requests to the Commission indicating that they wish to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection and that the Commission should submit a proposal to the Council to that end. This proposal is the Commission's response to those requests. ASSESSMENT OF THE LEGAL CONDITIONS FOR ENHANCED COOPERATION: the current national patent systems of Member States and the European patent system only provide territorially-limited protection. This resulted in ‘gaps’ that gave rise to the following undesirable effects: i) lost business opportunities; ii) innovative firms are at a disadvantage; iii) the value of patents is weakened, given that patent holders cannot count on Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 (the EU Customs Border Regulation) to prevent infringing goods and products from third countries from entering the internal market through Member States in which there is no patent protection. The creation of a unitary patent title for a group of Member States would entail immediate tangible advantages for users of the patent system in Europe: improved access to patent protection : the unitary patent for the area covered by enhanced cooperation would ensure easier access to patent protection for all users of the patent system in Europe both for applicants from participating Member States and from non-participating Member States. The area for enhanced cooperation would cover a market that is much larger than any market of a single Member State, resulting in reduced costs of protection relative to the size of the economy. cost reduction and simplification : unitary patent protection created under enhanced cooperation would result in significant cost reduction and simplification of the system for the users due to the central administration of the unitary patent and the simplified translation requirements. Today, the validation costs would be more than EUR 12 000 when protection in thirteen selected Member States is sought, Union-wide coverage would cost between EUR 22 000 to EUR 26 000 in validation costs. The translation costs under the simplified translation arrangements of enhanced cooperation would amount to approximately EUR 680 per patent. LEGAL BASE: enhanced cooperation is regulated by Article 20 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Articles 326 to 334 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This proposal is based on Article 329(1) TFEU. CONTENT: following the request of the twelve Member States, the purpose of this proposal is to authorise enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection. Once this enhanced cooperation has been authorised by the Council, specific measures will be proposed for its implementation. It is, however, appropriate to outline some key elements of the envisaged implementing measures. Since the creation of unitary patent protection is not possible without an agreement on the applicable translation arrangements, both the substantive provisions applicable to the unitary patent and the translation arrangements should be part of the envisaged implementing measures. The envisaged implementing measures should, therefore, include the following elements: 1) a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council creating unitary patent protection . That proposal could be based on the text agreed (general approach) in the Council in December 2009, as well as certain elements of the draft political orientation proposed by the Belgian Presidency, in particular: the unitary patent protection should be optional to the users of the patent system and should co-exist with national and European patents. The unitary patent should be a specific category of a European patent, granted by the European Patent Office, designating the Member States participating in enhanced cooperation on unitary basis; consequently, a single procedure in accordance with the EPC would apply to unitary patents and to all other European patents. Until the moment of grant, applicants would have the choice between i) a European patent valid in the territories of the participating Member States for which this patent would have unitary character, ii) a European patent valid in the territories of the participating Member States for which this patent would have unitary character but also designating selected other Contracting States of the EPC, or iii) a European patent designating only selected Contracting States of the EPC; the unitary patent should be of autonomous nature and provide equal protection throughout the territories of the participating Member States. It may only be granted, transferred, revoked or may lapse in respect of those territories as a whole. 2) a proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the unitary patent . This proposal would take over the main elements of the Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the EU patent, as well as certain elements of the draft political orientation proposed by the Belgian Presidency, in particular: it is envisaged that the specification of the unitary patent be published by the EPO in accordance with Article 14(6) EPC. Without prejudice to any transitional arrangements deemed necessary, no further translations would be required. Any additional translation requirements under such transitional arrangements would be proportionate and required only on a temporary basis and not have legal value thus ensuring legal certainty for the users of the patent system. In any case, transitional arrangements would terminate when high quality machine translations are made available, subject to an objective evaluation of the quality; translations should not have legal value , thus ensuring legal certainty for the users of the patent system; in case of a dispute relating to a unitary patent, a full manual translation of the patent specification would have to be provided by the patent proprietor at his expense a) into an official language of the Member State in which either the alleged infringement took place or in which the alleged infringer is domiciled (at the choice of the alleged infringer); and b) into the language of proceedings of the court hearing the dispute (at the request of the court). 3) a scheme for compensating the costs of translating patent applications filed in an official language of the Union into an official language of the EPO at the beginning of the procedure for applicants based in the Member States which have an official language other than one of the official languages of the EPO, should be set up in addition to what is currently in place for other European patents, including financial and technical assistance for preparing those translations."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: there is an alarming increase in the EU of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source. These products are, from the point of view of EU pharmaceutical legislation, illegal insofar as they do not comply with the Community rules for medicinal products. Moreover, the number of falsifications of innovative and life-saving medicines is increasing. In this way, in 2007, many thousand packs of falsified life-saving drugs reached patients in the EU. The underlying causes for falsified medicinal products remaining undetected in the legal supply chain are manifold, but can be reduced to four aspects: (i) falsified medicinal products can not always be easily distinguished from originals; (ii) the distribution chain has become very complex and is only as strong as its weakest link; (iii) there are legal uncertainties as to the regime applicable to products introduced into the EU while allegedly not being placed on the market; (iv) lastly, already the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) entering the manufacturing process may be a falsification of the original API. The existing provisions of Directive 2001/83/EC are in some respects insufficient to address these concrete causes. In view of the time span between the proposal for amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC and their effective implementation, there is a clear need for the Commission to act now. CONTENT: in order to address the risk of falsified medicinal products entering the legal supply chain, the Commission proposes a number of amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC. These include: certain obligations for stakeholders other than wholesale distributors, who are involved in the distribution chain. These stakeholders are typically involved in the transactions without actually handling the products (for example, by auctioning or brokering products); a legal basis for the Commission to render obligatory specific safety-features (such as a serial number or a seal) on the packaging of prescription-medicines; a prohibition in principle of manipulating (i.e. removing, tampering with, or over-labelling) safety features on the packaging by stakeholders situated “in-between” the original manufacturer and the last stakeholder in the distribution chain (typically the pharmacist) or end user (doctor/patient); compulsory audits of wholesale distributors of medicinal products in order to ensure reliability of business partners; strengthened requirements for imports of API from third countries if it could not be established that the regulatory framework in the respective third country ensures a sufficient level of protection of human health for products exported to the EU; audits of manufacturers of API; stricter rules for inspections including increased transparency of inspection results through publication in the EudraGMP database managed by the EMEA."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of Korea with a view to conclude an EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement. The agreement was then initialled on 15 October 2009. The agreement incorporates a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility of re-imposing the MFN (Most Favoured Nation) rate when as a result of a trade liberalisation imports take place in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. In order for these measures to be operational, such safeguard clause must be incorporated in EU law not least because the procedural aspects of the imposition of safeguard measures as well as the rights of interested parties, such as the right of defence, need to be specified. CONTENT: this proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause of the EU-Korea FTA. The main points are as follows: Principles: a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the provisions set out in the Regulation where a product originating in Korea is, as a result of the reduction or the elimination of the customs duties on that product, being imported in the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: suspensions of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the good concerned provided for under the Agreement; or increases of the rate of customs duty on the good to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the good in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the base rate of customs duty specified in the Schedules in the Annex of the Agreement. The terms ""serious injury"", ""threat of serious injury"" and ""transition period"" are defined in the text. Initiation of proceedings : the proposal lays down detailed provisions on the initiation of proceedings. The Commission should receive information including available evidence from Member States of any trends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures. If there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding the Commission will publish a notice as provided for in the Agreement in the Official Journal of the European Union. The investigation : the proposal lays down detailed provisions on the opening of investigations, access and inspections by interested parties to the information gathered, hearings for the parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views as provided for in the Agreement. The Commission shall notify the Republic of Korea in writing of the initiation of an investigation and consult with the Republic of Korea as far in advance of applying a bilateral safeguard measure as practicable, with a view to reviewing the information arising from the investigation and exchanging views on the measure. Pursuant to the Agreement, the proposal sets time limits for the initiation of investigations and for determinations as to whether or not measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : an investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure. However, there is the reservation that the Commission be allowed to apply provisional measures in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports of an originating good from Korea have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under the Agreement, and such imports cause serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. Provisional measures shall not apply for more than 200 days. Termination of investigation and proceeding without measures : where bilateral safeguard measures are deemed unnecessary the investigation and proceeding shall be terminated. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that the circumstances set out in the text are met, a decision to impose definitive bilateral safeguard measures shall be taken in accordance with the Comitology procedure referred to in the proposal. Duration and review of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, unless it is extended. The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU provides a budgetary guarantee to the EIB covering risks of a sovereign and political nature in connection with its loan and loan guarantee operations carried out outside the EU in support of EU external policy objectives. The overall scope and general conditions of the EU guarantee coverage for EIB external operations have been set out in previous Council decisions, the EIB external mandates. Most recently, the EIB external mandate for the period 2007-2011 was established by Decision No 633/2009/EC of 13 July 2009, which requires the Commission to present a mid-term report on its application accompanied by a proposal for its amendment, drawing on an external evaluation. On the basis of findings of the mid-term review, this proposal aims to ensure the continuation of the EU guarantee for EIB external financing for the remainder of the current financial perspectives 2007-2013, whilst introducing a number of new elements in the mandate. The introduction of these new elements necessitated a number of modifications to the current mandate Decision. For the sake of clarity, it was therefore chosen to replace the mandate Decision with a new decision rather than presenting a proposal for amendments. LEGAL BASES: Articles 209 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the EU. CONTENT : the proposed decision will cover EIB financing operations signed during the period beginning on 1 February 2007 and ending on 31 December 2013.The new elements to be introduced in the new decision are the following: activation of the EUR 2 billion ""optional mandate"", which was placed in reserve by the Decision. This optional mandate will be activated not as an increase of individual regional ceilings, but as a mandate dedicated to projects which contribute to the fight against climate change across all regions covered by the decision; replacing the current system of regional objectives for operations under EU guarantee with horizontal high-level objectives covering all regions under the external mandate. These high-level objectives will be included in the Articles of the proposed decision and will cover the areas of climate change, social and economic infrastructure and local private sector development; development by the Commission, together with the EIB, and in consultation with the European External Action Service (EEAS), of operational guidelines for each region under the external mandate, reflecting EU regional strategies in order to strengthen the link between the implementation of EIB activities in line with the general high-level objectives under the external mandate and EU regional priorities; strengthening of the capacity of the EIB to support EU development objectives through (i) enhancing the EIB's appraisal and monitoring of social and development aspects of projects; (ii)increasing the focus of EIB intervention in sectors which will further the development of third countries, such as environmental infrastructure including water and sanitation, sustainable transportation and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The EIB should also progressively increase its activity in support of health and education; activation of the EIB external mandate for Iceland, Belarus, Libya, Iraq and, Cambodia. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Guarantee Fund for external actions set up by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, provisioned by yearly transfers from the general EU budget, provides a buffer for the EU budget against shocks due to losses on EIB external financing operations. The forecasts take into account the impact of the EUR 2 billion ""optional mandate"" on the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund. On the basis of the 9% provisioning rate, the financial impact of the allocation of the EUR 2 billion on the provisioning of the Fund will amount to a maximum of EUR 180 million over the period 2012-2020, on the assumption that the corresponding loans are fully disbursed. The budgetary implications as regards the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund as well as the human and administrative resources involved in the administration of the EU guarantee for 2011-2013 is as follows:"

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement was adopted according to the objectives defined in the Commission’s communication “ Global Europe - Competing in the world ”, which describes how the EU's trade policy can contribute to achieving the European strategy for growth and employment. This underlined that the Doha programme for development remains the EU’s main priority. The communication also stressed the importance for the EU of using the framework provided by the WTO as the best way of opening up markets to trade and investment. It proposed a series of trade policy initiatives to complement efforts to relaunch WTO negotiations. Among these, it proposed the negotiation of carefully selected and prioritised free trade agreements (FTAs). Following the adoption of negotiating guidelines by the Council, on 23 April 2007, negotiations with Korea began in Seoul on 6 May 2007. These were completed with the initialling of the FTA, in Brussels, on 15 October 2009, after less than two and a half years of discussions. Parliament was kept informed regularly on the progress of the discussions by its Committee on International Trade (INTA). On 13 December 2007, Parliament adopted a resolution on economic and trade relations with Korea, which served as an important contribution to the negotiations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in preparation for the negotiations, the Commission undertook and impact assessment to examine the potential impact of an FTA with South Korea. A more detailed evaluation of the impact of trade on sustainable development, examining the potential effects of the agreement in the economic, social and environmental fields was carried out in parallel with the negotiations. Additional studies, to analyse the FTA from both a quantitative and quantitative point of view, were also undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Articles 91, 100(2) and 207, in conjunction with Article 218(6) a) v) of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal represents the legal instrument enabling the conclusion of the FTA between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and South Korea, on the other. The purpose of the agreement is to establish a progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services and to define rules on matters relating to trade. Commercial aspects: the EU-Korea FTA sets down the measures needed to establish a free trade area in accordance with the provisions of Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994). The two parties agreed to implement very rapidly the commitments to liberalise and will eliminate 98.7% of customs duties, in trade value, both for the industrial sector and for agriculture in the coming five years. The remaining customs duties will be eliminated almost entirely over longer transitional periods, with the exception of a small number of agricultural products, such as rice or garlic. Sectoral Annexes have been negotiated on electronics, motor vehicles and their parts, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, as well as chemicals with a view to the dismantling of non-tariff barriers. The FTA included the following distinct chapters covering: Electronic Commerce (with schedules of undertakings in this matter which clearly go beyond the commitments made by each party under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and that comply with Article V of the GATS) Competition and commercial compliance aspects: in terms of rules, the FTA defines ambitious commitments in the field of competition and, in particular: intellectual property (including the enforcement of these rules), More ambitious restrictive horizontal measures in regard to regulatory transparency in areas of importance for mutual trade and investment between the parties were also incorporated in the agreement. Separate protocols: the FTA includes various protocols, including a protocol on rules of origin and one concerning mutual administrative assistance in customs matters, which include provisions defining the origin of products - a concept that is used to determine the duties applicable to traded products – governing the proof of origin and laying down the practical details of cooperation between the customs authorities. It also includes a specific protocol on cooperation in the cultural field, which defines the terms of a strategic dialogue and cooperation to facilitate cultural exchanges. It also provides an institutional framework for implementation independent of that provided in the FTA itself , with the creation a separate committee and a specific mechanism for dispute resolution. Trade and sustainable development aspects: this section covers social and environmental aspects. It includes provisions on cooperation and establishes a novel monitoring mechanism involving civil society by means of a “forum of civil society”. Institutional aspects: institutional arrangements provide for the establishment of the Trade Committee, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the FTA and to examine how to further strengthen trade relations between the parties. An effective dispute resolution mechanism is provided for. The Trade Committee will comprise representatives of the EU and Korea. It will report on its activities and those of its committees, working groups and other specialized bodies to the Joint Committee established by the Framework Agreement. The updated framework agreement, coupled with the free trade agreement, reflects a new dimension of relations between the EU and Korea. At the request of the Council, the two agreements are legally and institutionally linked. Provisional application: until the entry into force, this provides for its provisional application. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no financial impact on the Union’s expenditure, but has a financial impact on its revenues."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: the European Community, as well as Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, are Contracting Parties to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (""GFCM""), a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation established under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. The GFCM may, on the basis of scientific advice, adopt recommendations and resolutions designed to promote the development, conservation, rational management and best utilization of stocks of living aquatic resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels are considered sustainable and at low risk. Since recommendations adopted by the GFCM are binding on its Contracting Parties and since the Community is such a contracting party, the recommendations are binding on the Community and should therefore be transposed, where their content is not already covered by Community legislation, into Community law. Until recently, recommendations adopted by GFCM have been transposed into Community on a temporary basis, through the annual regulations on fishing opportunities. However, the permanent character of such recommendations would require also a more permanent legal instrument for their transposition into Community law. CONTENT: this draft Regulation transposes recommendations of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), as adopted in its Annual Sessions into Community law. It lays down the rules for the application by the Community of the conservation, management, exploitation, monitoring, marketing and enforcement measures for fishery and aquaculture products as established by the GFCM. It applies to all commercial fishing and aquaculture activities conducted by Community fishing vessels and nationals of Member States in the GFCM Agreement Area. By way of derogation it does not apply to fishing operations conducted solely for the purpose of scientific investigations. Future recommendations can be added by way of amendments to the regulation. This will also improve legal certainty and it is an important step towards simplification. The content and obligations of the recommendations adopted by GFCM are often entirely or partly covered by EU legislation adopted previously and therefore only those aspects which differ from the EU legislation in question need to be transposed, as well as the relevant reporting obligations, where appropriate. Since GFCM recommendations apply to the entire GFCM agreement area which covers the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and connecting waters as referred to in Annex II to Council Decision 1998/416/EC, for reasons of clarity of Community legislation they should be transposed in a regulation separate from Regulation 1967/2006 which only covers the Mediterranean Sea. For reasons of autonomy the GFCM uses the term 'Fisheries Restricted Areas' for spatial management measures. This terminology is equivalent to the 'Fishing Protected Areas' as used in Regulation (EC) N° 1967/2006."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Moldova is experiencing difficulties with its wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the Moldovan government. This has led Moldova to request the European Commission in July 2010 to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine under the Autonomous Trade Preferences, granted to Moldova by Council Regulation (EC) 55/2008. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the wine sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 300 000 people (one fourth of the working population), who are mainly living in rural areas and cultivating medium to smaller family plots. It is therefore proposed to provide a measure to improve the general level of wine imports from Moldova to support the economic development of this country. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide a positive outlook to the people working in the wine industry in Moldova, it is proposed to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine: for 2011 from 100 000 hectolitres (hl) to 150 000 hl, for 2012 from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl, from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year. The level of the proposed increase is based on the fact that Moldova has systematically exhausted the existing quota and the potential of the sector to improve its niche markets in the EU, while at the same time the level of the increase does not destabilise the EU wine industry. It is expected that Moldova's wine sector will continue to improve the quality of its wines. As Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 expires on 31 December 2012, and as it is important to ensure legal certainty for producers, exporters and importers, it is proposed to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 for another three years to 31 December 2015. This is a reasonable amount of time, taking into account the perspectives for a future deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA) between the EU and Moldova. Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 foresees preferential tariff quotas also on other products in addition to wine. Having assessed the situation in the different sectors covered by the quotas, it is proposed to continue the progressive increase of some of those other quotas for the levels indicated in the annexed to this proposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EU budget. As the general level of imports from Moldova is merely 0.04% of all EU imports further market opening is not expected to create negative effects for the EU. Currently around 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU free of duties. The additional duty free tariff quotas proposed for the years 2011 to 2015 will result in a small loss of tariff revenue only for the year 2011. For the years 2012 to 2015 there will not be any loss of tariff revenue since present export volumes from Moldova of all the products covered by duty free tariff quotas are covered by the 2012 level of these quotas. Hypothetical revenue that could have been generated by future exports is not considered as a loss of tariff revenue."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: The European Network and Information Security Agency (hereinafter ENISA) was set up in March 2004 for an initial period of five years by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004. Regulation (EC) No 1007/2008 extended ENISA’s mandate until March 2012. The extension of ENISA’s mandate in 2008 also launched a debate on the general direction of European efforts towards network and information security (NIS), to which the Commission contributed by launching a public consultation (which ran from November 2008 to January 2009 and gathered nearly 600 contributions). On 30 March 2009, the Commission adopted a Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection(CIIP) focusing on the protection of Europe from cyber attacks and cyber disruptions by enhancing preparedness, security and resilience, with an Action Plan calling on ENISA to play a role, mainly in support to Member States. The Action Plan was broadly endorsed in the discussion at the Ministerial Conference on CIIP held in Tallinn, Estonia, on 27 and 28 April 2009. The European Union Presidency’s Conference Conclusions stress the importance of the need to rethink and reformulate the Agency’s mandate. After discussion at the Telecom Council of 11 June 2009, Member States expressed support for extending the ENISA’s mandate and increasing its resources in the light of the importance of NIS and the evolving challenges in the area It is therefore now proposed to extend ENISA’s mandate until 2013 to allow sufficient time for the adoption of a new Regulation that would thoroughly revise the provisions governing the Agency (a proposal for a recast of the Regulation establishing the Agency is proposed in parallel). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency with a view to extending its mandate until 13 September 2013, the time that will allow Parliament and Council to adopt a new Regulation revising the provisions governing the Agency and establishing the Agency for a 5-year duration. This proposal provides for the extension of the Agency’s current mandate by 18 months. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: in its financial impact statement, the European Commission estimates the necessary funding for the extension of ENISA’s current mandate at EUR 12.698 million in commitments and payments for the period running from 14 March 2012 to 13 September 2013. These sums would come from heading 1a of the financial perspectives (EUR 6.673 million in 2012 and EUR 6.025 million in 2013)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: work on the creation of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) started in May 1999, on the basis of the principles approved by the Tampere European Council. During the first phase of the CEAS (1999-2005), the goal was to harmonise Member States' legal frameworks on the basis of minimum standards. Directive 2005/85/EC was the last of the five pieces of EU asylum legislation. It aims to establish minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status. This proposal falls within the Policy Plan on Asylum which provides for the second phase of the CEAS. It aims to address the deficiencies in procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection and to ensure higher and more harmonised standards of protection, thus progressing towards a common asylum procedure and a uniform status. The amendment that have been proposed are drawn from the responses received to the Commission’s consultation on the Green Paper on the future of the Common European Asylum System which highlighted the proliferation of disparate procedural arrangements at national level and deficiencies regarding the level of procedural guarantees for asylum applicants, which are likely to give rise to gaps in protection and the risk of refoulement. Given that this lack of uniformity is a source of uncertainty for asylum seekers and blocks the advent of a truly common asylum system, the Commission has proposed the recasting of the 2005 text. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment mainly focused on the points that appeared the most controversial, as well as those that will require additional financial resources. At the end of the analysis, a number of options emerged to strengthen and harmonise EU asylum procedures. The preferred option provides for the establishment of harmonised procedural guarantees, notions and principles essential in Community law. In harmonising procedural arrangements, the preferred option is likely to guarantee access under equivalent conditions throughout the Union and a more equitable sharing of the ‘burden’ between the Member States. It is also an important step in the process of a single asylum procedure, the principle of non-refoulement and, more generally, respect for fundamental rights. CONTENT: the envisaged measures are expected to improve the coherence between EU asylum instruments, simplify, streamline and consolidate procedural arrangements across the Union and lead to more robust determinations at first instance, thus preventing abuse and improving efficiency of the asylum process. Main objective of the recasting of the directive: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure higher and more coherent standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection. It also aims at improving both the efficiency and the quality of decision making by “frontloading"" services, advice and expertise and encouraging Member States to deliver, within a reasonable time, robust determinations at first instance. The improved efficiency and quality of the asylum process should: (a) enable MS to quicker distinguish between asylum seekers and other migrants in mixed arrivals, thus optimising labour and administrative resources needed to establish and complete applicable procedures (return, asylum, humanitarian status, extradition etc.); (b) allow the asylum authorities to take robust decisions, based on complete and properly established factual circumstances of the claim, improve the defendability of negative decisions and reduce risk of their annulment by appeal bodies; (c) enable the asylum personnel to better identify cases of unfounded and abusive applications, including those based on false identity or nationality; (d) reduce Member States' reception costs and support their efforts to remove failed asylum seekers from the territory since quality determinations will be delivered quicker and more cases will result in a final decision already in the first instance. Genuine refugees and persons in need of subsidiary protection would enjoy quicker access to entitlements set out in the Qualification Directive. Lastly, the proposal aims at simplifying and consolidating procedural notions and devices and improving consistency between asylum instruments. This should, among other things, limit the phenomenon of secondary movements of asylum seekers amongst Member States, to the degree that such movements are generated from divergent procedural arrangements. The main amendments proposed are as follows: (a) measures to ensure the consistency between different asylum instruments: the proposal provides for a single procedure, thus making it clear that applications should be considered in the light of both forms of international protection set out in the Qualification Directive (refuges status and subsidiary protection status). It further specifies the rules applicable in the single procedure, such as a mandatory sequence of an examination of the protection needs in relation to refugee status and subsidiary protection status, and extends the present rules on the withdrawal of refugee status to cases of the withdrawal of subsidiary protection. (b) scope: the proposal makes it clear that the procedural principles and guarantees set out in the Asylum Procedures Directive apply to applicants who are the subject to procedures pursuant to the Dublin Regulation  in the second Member State . It underlines that the notion of implicit withdrawal of applications should not be an obstacle for applicants to re-access asylum procedures in the responsible Member State. (c) access to procedures: the proposal provides for a number of guarantees aimed at enhancing access to asylum procedures: it explicitly includes territorial waters in the scope of the Directive and specifies the obligations of border guards, police and personnel of detention facilities; it provides for a time limit for completing formalities related to the lodging of an application; it introduces guarantees aimed at enabling de facto asylum seekers to articulate their request for protection when they are present at the border crossing points or pre-removal detention facilities. (d) procedural guarantees in procedures at first instance: the proposal aims to increase the overall level of fairness in asylum procedures, thus leading to more consistent application of agreed procedural principles and guarantees. The proposed changes would: reduce exceptions to the procedural principles and guarantees set out in the present Directive. In particular, the proposal deletes the possibility to omit a personal interview in accelerated procedures; provide for additional guarantees, such as the right to free legal assistance for applicants for international protection in procedures at first instance; introduce special guarantees for vulnerable asylum applicants. These include, among other things, rules dealing with medico-legal reports, exemption of certain categories of applicants from accelerated or border procedures and procedural arrangements aimed at establishing the elements of the application in cases involving gender and/or age based persecution. (e) prevention of abuse of procedures: the measures envisaged would also contribute to preventing abuse of procedures by improving applicants' awareness of applicable requirements leading inter alia to better compliance with procedural obligations. They would also support efforts of asylum authorities to take defendable and robust decisions, based on complete and properly established factual circumstances of the claim. It is in this context that the following changes are made with a view to strengthening procedural arrangements: inadmissibility decisions: according to the proposal, the applicant concerned should be able to make his/her views with regard to the application of the inadmissibility grounds known to the authorities before a decision to consider an application inadmissible has been taken; notion of a safe third country: the proposal deletes the European safe third country notion and incorporates the grounds of subsidiary protection in the list of material requirements for the application of the safe third country notion; manifestly unfounded applications: the proposal also revises the present arrangements for accelerated procedures providing for a limited and exhaustive list of grounds for an accelerated examination of manifestly unfounded applications and underlines that the determining authority should be given sufficient time to carry out a rigorous examination of an application in such cases. These measures are further strengthened by underlining the principle of a single determining authority. The latter amendment accommodates institutional arrangements of the majority of Member States and is indispensable with a view to ensuring the availability of institutional expertise and delivering robust determinations, based on complete and accurately established factual circumstances; time limits for procedures at first instance: the envisaged general 6 month time limit accommodates legislative amendments and/or practices of the majority of Member States, consulted in the process of preparing the amendments. It is instrumental in improving the efficiency of examinations, reducing reception costs, facilitating removal of failed asylum seekers and ensuring quicker access to protection for genuine refugees and persons in need of subsidiary protection. The amendments also provide for the possibility of extending the time limit for 6 more months in individual cases; subsequent applications: the proposal further consolidates the Directive's provisions dealing with subsequent applications with a view to enabling Member States to subject a subsequent application to an admissibility test in line with the res judicata principle and to derogate from the right to remain in the territory in cases of multiple subsequent applications thus preventing abuse of asylum procedures. safe country of origin: the proposal deletes the notion of a minimum common list of safe countries of origin and consolidates the common objective criteria for the national designation of third countries as safe countries of origin. These notions and devices have been revised to providing asylum authorities with necessary procedural tools to prevent / respond to abuse and process quickly clearly unfounded or less complex applications. In order to reduce the root causes of repeated applications, the proposal makes it clear that the applicant and the determining authority should take all necessary efforts to establish and assess the elements of the initial application in line with the cooperative requirement set out in Article 4(1) of the Qualification Directive. (f) access to effective remedy: lastly, the proposal facilitates access to effective remedy for asylum applicants in line with Community and international obligations of Member States. The proposal provides for a full and ex nunc review of first instance decisions by a court or tribunal and specifies that the notion of effective remedy requires a review of both facts and points of law. Furthermore, the proposal aims at bringing the appeal proceedings pursuant to the Directive in line with the ""equality of arms"" principle and, subject to limited exceptions, provides for automatic suspensive effect of appeals against first instance decisions on applications for international protection."

The objectives of the proposal can be better achieved at European Union level on the basis of a European legal act, because only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at European Union level; the collection of data and compilation of comparable statistics on tourism, on the other hand, can be organised by the Member States. Comparability is a central quality concern for any statistical data. The Member States cannot achieve comparability to the necessary extent without a clear European framework, i.e. European legislation laying down common statistical concepts, reporting formats and quality requirements."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea provides for financing in the following areas: international relations, governance, data collection and scientific advice and control and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy. In each field of action, Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 is completed by other regulations or decisions. Several elements of the related legislation have evolved since the adoption of Regulation 861/2006 which should be amended in order to ensure coherence between all the elements of the legislative framework. Experience has demonstrated the need to amend the Regulation in order to slightly adapt some provisions to better fit the needs. It is also proposed to clarify when necessary the scope of the measures financed and to improve the drafting of some articles. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: this revision does not entail any fundamental changes to Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006: the objectives, the type of measures financed, the architecture and the financial envelope are not affected. Modifications due to the evolution of the legislative framework : the scope of the new data collection framework is larger than the previous framework. It covers not only the collection of data by Member States but also its management and use; take into consideration the fact that in Council Decision 2007/409/EC the Regional Advisory Councils have been granted the status of bodies pursuing an aim of general European interest. They can be granted financial support to cover their operating costs and the restriction which limited support to their start up phase has been deleted; Article 5 has been modified to mirror the provisions of the new data collection framework, under which the data to be collected also comprises socio-economic variables in the fisheries, aquaculture and processing sector, such as income, capital costs, employment, etc; reformulate and simplify Article 9 on the collection, management and use of data in order to align the description with the other areas of expenditure covered by the Regulation, by identifying only the main categories of measures. The eligible measures are defined in detail by Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 concerning the establishment of a Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the Common Fisheries Policy; take account of the relevant provisions of the new data collection framework which define in detail the programming procedures; delete Article 23 as it has become obsolete since the programming procedures are now defined in the new data collection framework. Responding to the needs : amendments aim to: allow the Commission to sign procurement contracts with the international bodies in charge of stock assessments; extend the possibility of financing the costs related to the preparation of Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA) meetings to other representative organisations in ACFA. This amendment shall allow for financial support for translation, interpretation and room hire costs related to these meetings; advance the date for the submission of applications for Community support. This is designed to accelerate procedures and programme implementation; give a more detailed description of the information to be provided in order to standardise the data received on the projects and to reinforce sound financial management. It also specifies information required for joint projects conducted by more than one Member State; provide information on the mechanisms which will allow verification on the use of the co financed control resources; improve the transmission of data on the projects. Clarification of the scope of the actions to be undertaken : a number of provisions of Decision 2000/439/EC on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy were not taken over in Regulation (EC) 861/2006 and were also not converted into implementing rules. This created a legal void for the years 2007 and 2008 in which the Commission had to apply the rules previously in force as laid down in Decision 2000/439/EC. In the interest of legal certainty it should be retroactively provided that those rules continued to be applicable in that period. Other proposed amendments aim to: clarify that the partnerships in the international field may be at bilateral, regional or multilateral level; replace the words ""civil servants"" with ""personnel"" to cater for the fact that training participants, although representing a Member State authority, are not necessarily civil servants; replace the words ""irresponsible and illegal fishing"" with ""illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing"", which is the used notably in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008; better reflect the tasks carried out by the Joint Research Centre, which not only analyses the implementation of control activities, but also gives advice and is involved in developing new technologies; delete a superfluous category of expenditure for the Community Fisheries Control Agency; update the list of consultative bodies for the meetings of which the ACFA plenary designates a representative; reflect the range of cooperation which the Commission may need to establish with international organisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the modifications introduced by this amending proposal do not entail financial consequences on the EU budget. They will simply allow better execution of the budget amounts as quantified in the Financial Statement attached to Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in June 2008, the Commission made a proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures. The proposal was intended to replace Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms and certain transitional technical measures as laid down in Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 establishing for 2009 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks. The proposed Council Regulation was not adopted before the date on which the measures provided for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 ceased to apply. For reasons of legal certainty and in order to maintain the proper conservation and management of marine resources, Council Regulation (EC) No 1288/2009 establishing transitional technical measures from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011 was adopted, providing for the continuation of temporary technical measures catered for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 for a transitional period of 18 months. In view of the new requirements of the Lisbon Treaty, the Commission withdrew in 2010 the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures. Basic principles on technical measures will be considered by the new basic regulation for the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy, for which a proposal is envisaged during the third quarter of 2011. Regulation (EC) No 1288/2009 will expire on 30 June 2011 . Given the fact that there is no current legal act that could provide for permanent technical measures, and in order to ensure legal certainty and the conservation of marine resources, it is appropriate to extend the validity of the regulation for another 18 months, until 1 January 2013. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no financial implications for the budget of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 lays down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue, including rules on vaccination. In the past, only sporadic incursions of certain serotypes of the bluetongue virus were recorded in the Union. Those incursions mainly occurred in the southern parts of the Union. However, after the adoption of Directive 2000/75/EC, and particularly after the introduction into the Union of bluetongue virus serotypes 1 and 8 in the years 2006 and 2007, the bluetongue virus has become more widespread in the Union, with the potential of becoming endemic in certain areas. It has therefore become difficult to control the spread of that virus. The rules on vaccination against bluetongue laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC are based on experience of the use of so-called ""modified live vaccines"", or ""live attenuated vaccines"" that were the only vaccines available when that Directive was adopted. In recent years, as a result of new technology, ""inactivated vaccines"" against bluetongue have become available, which do not pose that risk to unvaccinated animals. It is now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for bluetongue control and the prevention of clinical disease in the Union. Under the current rules, the use of vaccines against bluetongue is prohibited outside ""restricted zones"" where the disease has appeared and where animal movement has been restricted. PREFERRED OPTION AND ASSESSMENT OF ITS IMPACTS: the Commission considers that the amendment of the legislation is necessary to reflect the technological progress in the field of vaccine development. The current obstacles for preventive vaccination outside areas subjected to animal movement restrictions are not necessary when modern safe ""inactivated vaccines"" are used. The proposed amendment will facilitate decision making on bluetongue control strategies on the basis of the specific situation within the Member States without unnecessary intervention by the Union. LEGAL BASIS: the legal basis of Directive 2000/75/EC is the second indent of Article 15 of Council Directive 92/119/EEC of 17 December 1992 introducing general Community measures for the control of certain animal diseases and specific measures relating to swine vesicular disease. This article provides that the Council may adopt specific provisions relating to the control and eradication measures for any of the animal diseases listed in Annex I to the Directive, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission. Since the basic act providing for this legal basis is still in force, the legality of the powers vested in the Council in this act are not affected by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and these powers remain solely with the Council. CONTENT: in order to ensure the better control of the spread of the bluetongue virus and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by that disease, it is appropriate to amend the current rules on vaccination laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC in order to take account of the recent technological developments in vaccine production. The proposed amendments should make the rules on vaccination more flexible and also take into account the fact that inactivated vaccines are now available, which can also be successfully used outside areas subjected to animal movement restrictions. T he use of live attenuated vaccines should not be excluded provided that appropriate precautionary measures are taken, as their use might still be necessary under certain circumstances, such as following the introduction of a new bluetongue virus serotype against which inactivated vaccines may not be available. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the TFEU) establishes the EU's exclusive competence on foreign direct investment, as part of the common commercial policy . Prior to the entry into force of the TFEU, Member States concluded more than 1000 bilateral agreements relating to investment with third countries, which relate in part or in full to foreign direct investment. Such agreements include Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) which provide guarantees on the conditions of investment in Member States and in third countries, in the form of specific commitments that are binding under international law. Although agreements remain binding on the Member States as a matter of public international law, in the light of the entry into force of the TFEU the existence of Member States' agreements relating to investment should be addressed from the perspective of the EU's exclusive competence on foreign direct investment. In the absence of an explicit transitional regime in the TFEU clarifying the status of Member States' agreements, this proposal will authorise the continued existence of all investment agreements currently in force between Member States and third countries. LEGAL BASE : Article 207(2) TFEU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission evaluated a number of options without carrying out a formal impact assessment. The proposal stresses the importance of legal certainty and notes that soft-law instruments, such as a declaration or statement by the Commission services or by the College on the validity of bilateral investment agreements, would not establish the legal certainty that is required to guarantee the agreements concerned. CONTENT : the draft Regulation provides for an explicit guarantee of legal certainty as regards the conditions under which investors operate. In recognition of the fact that Member States may be required to amend investment agreements, in particular to bring them in compliance with Treaty obligations, the proposal also establishes a framework to empower Member States to enter into negotiations with a third country with a view to modifying an existing bilateral agreement relating to investment. This framework is also available to Member States to negotiate, under certain conditions, a new bilateral agreement with third countries relating to investment. Given that the EU is exclusively competent for foreign direct investment, and that an EU investment policy will be gradually developed, the procedure established by this proposal must be regarded as an exceptional transitional measure. Objective : this is to authorise the continuation in force of international agreements relating to investment concluded between Member States and third countries and to establish conditions and a procedural framework for the negotiation and conclusion by Member States of such agreements. Chapter I sets out the subject matter and scope of the Regulation. Chapter II provides for authorisation for existing bilateral agreements that Member States have concluded with third countries to remain in force. The provisions: require Member States to notify to the Commission of all agreements that they wish to maintain, including agreements which have been concluded but not entered into force; authorise the maintenance in force of all existing agreements between Member States and third countries relating to investment that have been notified by Member States, starting upon the entry into force of this Regulation; provide for the annual publication of all notified agreements in the Official Journal, to ensure that the exact scope of the legal coverage provided by the Regulation is known by all stakeholders; provides for the review of agreements which have been notified. The Commission will assess whether the agreements conflict with the law of the Union, undermine negotiations or agreements relating to investment between the Union and third countries, or undermine the Union's policies relating to investment, including in particular the common commercial policy. No later than five years after the entry into force of the Regulation, the Commission will present a report based on the review of the agreements and any possible recommendations to discontinue the application of the provisions of Chapter II or to modify these provisions; detail the possible withdrawal of the authorisation granted under this Chapter. A withdrawal of authorisation may be necessary for agreements with a given third country when (i) these agreements conflict with the law of the Union, or (ii) overlap with an agreement of the Union with that third country; or (iii) undermine the Union's policies relating to investment, including the common commercial policy (e.g. where the existence of agreements undermines the willingness of a third country to negotiate with the Union), or (iv) where the Council has not taken a decision on the authorisation to open negotiations concerning investment within one year of the submission of a recommendation by the Commission. Chapter III provides for the modification of existing agreements and the conclusion of new agreements. This Chapter: provides for the general framework under which Member States may conclude or modify bilateral agreements relating to investment; requires the notification to the Commission of a Member States' intent to modify an existing or to conclude a new bilateral agreement with a third country. Member States are requested to provide all relevant documentation relating to the re-negotiation or negotiation of an agreement, which can be made available to other Member States and the European Parliament subject to the requirements of confidentiality; details the substantive grounds on the basis of which the Commission would not authorise the opening of formal negotiations by Member States, which include notably the ground that a Member State initiative could undermine the objectives of EU negotiations or EU policy. The Commission may require a Member State to include in a negotiation appropriate clauses, for example with respect to (a) the termination of the agreement in the event of the conclusion of a subsequent agreement between the Union with the same third country (see for example the denunciation or replacement clauses in Regulation 662/2009); (b) transfer provisions or (c) most-favoured nation treatment with to ensure equal treatment of all EU investors in the relevant third country; requires that Member States keep the Commission informed of negotiations that have been authorised. In addition, the Commission may request to participate as an observer in the negotiations concerning investment between the Member State and the third country; provides for the procedure under which Member States can be authorised to sign and conclude an agreement; provides for the review of authorisations that would be made pursuant to Chapter III of the Regulation. Chapter IV sets out certain requirements regarding the conduct of Member States with regard to agreements covered by this Regulation. The Chapter: requests Member States provide information with respect to meetings which take place under the auspices of covered agreements, and to inform the Commission of any request for dispute settlement and to cooperate with the Commission as regards the activation of dispute; provides that Member States may indicate whether any of the information they provide is to be considered confidential and whether it can be shared with other Member States; creates a new committee which shall assist the Commission in the management of the Regulation and stipulates the procedures under which this committee shall operate. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : The proposal has no implication for the EU Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: The EU completed in early August 2010 the disbursement of a EUR 46 million macrofinancial assistance (MFA) operation to Georgia approved by the Council in November 2009. The assistance, which was provided in the form of grants, was part of a pledge of two possible MFA operations of the same amount made by the European Commission at the International Donors' Conference of October 2008. The approval of the second MFA was conditional on the continued existence of external financing needs over and above those covered by the IMF arrangement. In a letter from 10 May 2010, the Georgian Minister of Finance requested the activation of the second part of the Commission pledge of EU funds, amounting to EUR 46 million, which is the subject of this proposal. The Commission considers that the activation of the second part of the MFA pledged in 2008 is warranted. Although the Georgian economy is recovering (following the double shock caused by the military conflict with Russia of August 2008 and the global financial crisis), the balance of payments and budgetary position remain weak and vulnerable. The new MFA would contribute to help Georgia to address the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis. The new MFA will support the economic reform agenda of the government. It would reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance would also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management, as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the MFA and the economic adjustment and reform programme attached to it will help alleviate Georgia's short-term financing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening medium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability, raising sustainable growth and promoting economic integration and regulatory convergence with the EU. It will also help improve the efficiency and transparency of public finance management, building on the positive impact of the previous MFA operation in the country. MFA will also support the macroeconomic stabilisation and structural policies of the programme agreed with the IMF. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the EU shall make the MFA available to Georgia for a total maximum amount of EUR 46 million, half of which will be provided as grants and half as loans. The assistance will contribute to cover Georgia's residual external financing needs in 2009-2011, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance will be disbursed in 2011 in two equal instalments, each of them consisting of a grant and a loan element. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be taken into account. The main points are as follows: the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2011; the second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the third quarter of 2011; as is usual with the MFA instrument, the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement; in addition, the Commission and the Georgian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. In the context of the previous MFA operations, the Commission services have worked closely with the Georgian authorities on public finance management (PFM) reforms that aim at establishing a more transparent, coherent and accountable PFM system; in the new MFA operation, the scope of the policy conditionality would be enlarged, notably to measures aimed at fostering the economic and financial integration as well as regulatory harmonisation with the EU in selected areas, under the ENP Action Plan and taking into account the new context created by the plan to conclude an Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia; the new MFA would be exceptional and limited in time and is intended to run in parallel to the SBA. It will complement support from international and bilateral donors; the proposal includes a sunset clause. The proposed MFA would be made available for 2.5 years starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Following the successful implementation of the last MFA, in which the Georgian authorities demonstrated the political will and the capacity to implement structural reforms, the Commission believes that also this second MFA operation would contribute to the implementation of the government's agenda of structural reforms. The conditions will be consistent with the priorities of the EU-Georgia ENP Action Plan. The decision to disburse half of the proposed assistance in grants and the other half in loans is justified by Georgia’s level of development (as measured by its per capital income) and debt indicators, and the recent improvement in the country's economic situation. The full use of grants in the previous operation had to be understood as an exceptional decision justified by the very difficult circumstances Georgia found itself in late 2008. The blend of grants and loans is also consistent with the fact that Georgia has been a blend country for the World Bank since January 2009. For the forthcoming World Bank operations, the country is expected to receive one third of the World Bank assistance in the form of the IDA lending, while two thirds of the assistance are expected to be provided on IBRD terms. The new MFA will reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance will also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management (building on those of the previous operation and of the EU's sectoral budgetary support operation), as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the grant element of the assistance of EUR 23 million would be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2011 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), with payments taking place in 2011. In line with the Guarantee Fund Regulation, the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund is expected to take place in 2013 and to amount to a maximum of EUR 2.1 million. This corresponds to 9% of the EUR 23 million loan expected to be disbursed in 2011."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Framework Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by Directive 2009/140/EC invites the Commission to present a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and Council to establish a multiannual Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP) setting out policy orientations and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of spectrum, taking utmost account of the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG). Spectrum is essential for the digital society, fast wireless services, economic recovery, growth, high-quality jobs and long-term EU competitiveness. Spectrum policy initiatives are also key to the Digital Agenda for Europe and to the Europe 2020 strategy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identifies options and assesses whether EU intervention would add value compared to national or regional action. It identifies the strategic direction necessary for spectrum policy at EU level. It highlights the need for a global EU spectrum policy approach given the impact of spectrum on a number of sectors with varying degrees of EU competence. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed programme sets out policy orientations and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of spectrum use in order to achieve the internal market. It supports the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Digital Agenda for Europe and promotes other EU policies concerned with spectrum. It will ensure the application of principles and define policy orientations for all aspects of spectrum policy with an EU dimension. The programme sets concrete priority initiatives for enhanced coordination, flexibility, and availability of spectrum for wireless broadband communications and other specific EU policies; it requires an inventory of existing uses and emerging spectrum. It identifies improvements to safeguard EU interests in international negotiations, and to assist Member States in bilateral negotiations, and calls for improved cooperation between technical bodies."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the requirements regarding the presentation of proof of origin for textile products were introduced with a view to ensuring the correct application of measures on products to which quantitative restrictions applied and to avoid market disruption caused by imports from the People’s Republic (PR) of China. Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 provides for the conditions of acceptance of proofs of origin for certain textile products originating in third countries and falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature, listed in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93. In recent years, the import measures applied by the Union to textile products have gradually decreased in their number and impact. Quantitative restrictions on imports originating in countries which are WTO Members were eliminated with the expiry of the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing in 2005. Special safeguard provisions for imports of textiles and apparel products originating in the PR of China and covered by the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) ended on 31 December 2008 and the regime of double-checking surveillance system of imports categories originating in the PR of China expired. The management of imports of textile products from third countries, not members of the WTO, subject to remaining quantitative restrictions is based on import authorisations and not on proofs of origin. The presentation of a proof of origin has no value when a system of surveillance is applied for the categories of products not subject to quantitative restrictions. Given that the products can be imported without any constraints, there is no reason for demanding guarantees regarding their origin. As a consequence, given that the Union trade policy measures in textiles sector are limited and can be managed without proofs of origin, it is proposed to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 and, in parallel, to amend the related provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission looked at two possible options: Option 1 : no legislative action (which does not appear to be consistent with Community law and the recognised need for simplification) and, Option 2 : legislative action (this would contribute to improving the regulatory environment for industry and align the rules relating to textile imports with those of other industrial products, for which the presentation of certificates of origin is not compulsory). The Commission’s preferred option is Option 2 since its objective is to remove from the Union set of rules a legal instrument which is unnecessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal repeals Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 and amends the relevant provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 regarding the conditions of acceptance of proofs of origins. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget as it does not involve any additional expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is a result of the review of the Consumer Acquis which covers a number of Directives on consumer protection. The Review was launched in 2004 with the objective to simplify and complete the existing regulatory framework. The proposal aims at revising four Directives: Directive 85/577/EEC on contracts negotiated away from business premises, Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts, Directive 97/7/EC on distance contracts, Directive 1999/44/EC on consumer sales and guarantees. These four Directives provide for consumer contractual rights. They contain minimum harmonisation clauses meaning that Member States may maintain or adopt stricter consumer protection rules. Member States have made extensive use of this possibility. The outcome is a fragmented regulatory framework across the Community which causes significant compliance costs for businesses wishing to trade cross-border. The internal market effects of the fragmentation are a reluctance by businesses to sell cross-border to consumers which in turn reduces consumer welfare. That review has shown that it is appropriate to replace those four Directives by this single Directive. This Directive should accordingly lay down standard rules for the common aspects and move away from the minimum harmonisation approach in the former Directives under which Member States could maintain or adopt stricter national rules. The European Parliament, in its Resolution of 6 September 2007 recommended that legislative action is taken and expressed its preference for the adoption of an instrument taking the form of a horizontal Directive based on full targeted harmonisation. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to contribute to the proper functioning of the business-to-consumer internal market and achieve a high common level of consumer protection by fully harmonising the key aspects of consumer contract law which are relevant for the internal market. - Chapter I contains the common definitions such as 'consumer' and 'trader' and lays down the principle of full harmonisation. - Chapter II contains a core of information to be provided by traders prior to the conclusion of all consumer contracts as well as an information obligation on intermediaries concluding contracts on behalf of consumers. - Chapter III which only applies to distance and off-premises contracts, provides for specific information requirements and regulates the right of withdrawal (length, exercise and effects) in a consistent manner. It also refers to a standard withdrawal form reproduced in Annex I(B). - Chapter IV clarifies the provisions of Directive 99/44/EC. It maintains the principle that the trader is liable to the consumer for a period of two years if the goods are not in conformity with the contract. It introduces a new rule whereby the risk of loss or damage of the goods is transferred to the consumer only when he or a third person indicated by him other than the carrier acquires the material possession of the goods. - Chapter V broadly reflects the provision of Directive 93/13/EEC. It applies to unfair contract terms which have not been individually negotiated, such as standard contract terms. Unfair terms are those creating significant imbalances in the rights and obligations of consumers and of traders and are not binding on consumers. In order to ensure legal certainty, the Directive contains two lists of unfair terms. Annex II contains a list of terms which in all circumstances are considered unfair. Annex III contains a list of terms which are deemed unfair unless the trader proves otherwise. These same lists apply in all Member States and may only be amended by the comitology procedure provided for by the Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/25/EC on action to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by engines intended to power agricultural and forestry tractors. The current stage of emission limits applicable for type approval of the majority of compression ignition engines is referred to as Stage III A. The directive provides that those limits will be replaced by the more stringent Stage III B limits, entering into force progressively as of 1 January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market and from 1 January 2010 as regards the type approval for those engines. T he transition to Stage III B involves a step change in technology requiring significant implementation costs for re-designing the engines and for developing advanced technical solutions. This transition stipulated by the legislator in 2005 coincides with the economic recession in the sector concerned which makes it difficult for the industry to bear the implementation costs necessary in order to adapt to the new legal requirements. Directive 2000/25/EC provides for a flexibility scheme to allow tractor manufacturers to purchase, in the period between two emission stages, a limited quantity of engines that do not comply with the current emission limit values, but are approved to the nearest previous stage of emission limits. In order to provide a temporary relief to industry when moving to the next stage, it is necessary to adapt the conditions for applying the flexibility scheme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal takes into account a Technical Review of the Directive 97/68/EC by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) which includes, inter alia, an evaluation of the need to amend the provisions of the flexibility scheme; an Impact Assessment study by an external consultant to assess the impacts of the proposed policy options as laid down in the draft Technical Review of JRC, and a complementary study on the impacts of the options of the Technical Review of JRC, including consequences of an amendment of the flexibility scheme for SMEs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal addresses the situation that manufacturers face difficulties to get Stage III B compliant engines approved and place them on the market due to delays in the design of new engines and the unexpected financial crisis. It is proposed to modify the provisions of the flexibility scheme to mitigate the effects from the transition of emission Stages III A to III B by extending its application while maintaining the entry into force of the exhaust emission limit Stage III B to preserve the objective of the Directive to reduce emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants in the European Union. More specifically, the aim of this Directive is to amend Directive 2000/25/EC as follows: an increase of the percentage of the number of engines placed on the market under the flexibility scheme in each engine category from 20% to 50% of the tractor manufacturer’s annual sales of equipment and an adaptation of the maximum number of engines that may be placed on the market under the flexibility scheme as an optional alternative, in the period between emission Stage III A to emission Stage III B. This measure will expire on 31 December 2013. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: This proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in June 2009, the Commission adopted a legislative proposal package to establish an Agency responsible for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (for more details, please refer to the summary dated 24 June 2009). The legislative package initially consisted of two proposals: a proposal for a Regulation establishing the Agency, and a proposal for a Council Decision conferring upon the Agency established by this Regulation tasks regarding the operational management of SIS II and VIS in application of Title VI of the EU Treaty. The proposed Regulation covered the SIS II, VIS and EURODAC to the extent they were governed by the EC Treaty. The proposed Decision covered the SIS II and VIS to the extent they were governed by the EU Treaty. Upon entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, the former distinction between EC Treaty and EU Treaty legal bases in the area of freedom, security and justice disappeared. Moreover, as notified to the European Parliament and to the Council by the Communication in December 2009, the proposal for a Council Decision lapsed and was formally withdrawn. Therefore, these two texts need to be merged into this single amended proposal for a Regulation, which takes into account the changes resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and which contains the substantive provisions initially proposed as a Council Decision. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five possible options to achieve the objective of long-term operational management of SIS II, VIS and EURODAC were analysed: Option 1 - baseline : the operational management solution for SIS II and VIS identified for the transitional period (the Commission entrusting the operational management tasks to Member States' authorities) would be continued as a permanent solution. Currently, EURODAC is managed by the Commission and this solution would also be maintained; Option 2 - baseline+ : under which the Commission would entrust the operational management tasks related to SIS II, VIS and EURODAC to Member States' authorities; Option 3 - a new Regulatory Agency that would assume responsibility for the long-term operational management of SIS II, VIS and EURODAC; Option 4 - FRONTEX would manage the three systems, which would entail changes to both its basic act and its management structure; Option 5 - EUROPOL would manage SIS II, whereas the Commission would manage VIS and EURODAC. This option was considered while negotiations on the conversion of the current Europol Convention into a Community act were still ongoing. As a result of a comparative analysis, the new Regulatory Agency option, which aims to create a joint operational management structure (option 3) for SIS II, VIS and EURODAC scored highest. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 77(2)(a) and (b), 78(2)(e), 79(2)(c), 74, 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The proposal respects the principle of subsidiarity, as the objective of the proposed action, the conferring of the operational management of Central SIS II, Central VIS and the National Interfaces, Central EURODAC, as well as certain aspects of their communication infrastructure, on an Agency, cannot be achieved by the Member States individually. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a European Agency for the operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), EURODAC and for developing and managing other large-scale IT systems, in application of Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The regulatory Agency shall be established as a Union body, having legal personality. The first tasks to be conferred on the Agency are operational, that is to say, ensuring the overall management of the information systems and the operation of the systems. It would thus become a ""centre of excellence"" with specialised operational staff. The Agency's core task will be to fulfil the operational management tasks for SIS II, VIS and EURODAC, keeping the systems functioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week, thus ensuring a continuous, uninterrupted flow of data exchange. Beyond these operational tasks, the corresponding responsibilities for adopting security measures, reporting, publishing, monitoring, information, organising specific VIS and SIS II related trainings, implementing pilot schemes upon specific and precise request of the Commission and monitoring of research will be assigned to the Agency. The Agency could also potentially be responsible for developing and managing other large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. This would be subject to legislative instruments establishing such systems that in turn would provide the Agency with the respective competences. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Agency will be funded by the general budget of the European Union. The necessary appropriations to cover the activities of the Agency will come from the appropriations currently foreseen in the Financial Programming 2011-2013 in the budget lines: 18 02 04""Schengen Information System (SIS II)""; 18 02 05""Visa Information System (VIS)""; 18 03 11""EURODAC"". Therefore, the proposal does not impact on the financial framework for 2007-2013. The financial statement annexed to this proposal is based on the assumption that it will be adopted in 2010 in order for the Agency to be legally established in 2011 and become a fully fledged Agency in 2012. Overall, the preparatory and start-up phase of the Agency between 2010 and 2013 is estimated at EUR 113 million, which will be covered by the 2007‑2013 financial framework."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers' interests to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market. Applicable as of 29th December 2005, the Regulation achieves this aim by creating an enforcement cooperation network between public enforcement authorities and thus increasing consumer confidence in taking up cross-border offers, and preventing sellers and suppliers from evading enforcement to the competitive detriment of law-abiding sellers and suppliers. The network established by the Regulation monitors and enforces legislation which protects consumers' interests. The legislation which falls into the scope of the network is listed in the Annex referred to in Article 3(a) of the Regulation. The amendment of the Annex will consist of the removal from the Annex of legislation which is not relevant for consumer protection cooperation and the updating of references to old legislation which is no longer in force by references to the current legislation in the field of consumer protection. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the proposed amending Regulation does not have significant economic, social and environmental impacts, an impact assessment is not necessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the overall goals of the proposed amending regulation are to ensure that Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws remains efficient and continues to guarantee that there is no discrimination between intra-EU and national transactions as to the effectiveness with which infringements are pursued by the competent national authorities. To achieve these goals, the proposed amending regulation has as its objective to update the contents of the Annex to the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation to reflect recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: about 20 years ago, financial groups with business models that combine the provision of services and products in different sectors of financial markets began to develop. These became known as financial conglomerates. Conglomerates may include banks, insurance undertakings, investment firms and possibly asset management companies. Directive 2002/87/EC ('FICOD') introduced group-wide supplementary supervision. The objective of this supplementary supervision was to control potential risks arising from double gearing (i.e. multiple use of capital) and group risks, that is, the risks of contagion, management complexity, concentration, and conflicts of interest, which could arise when several licenses for different financial services are combined. Whilst the banking and insurance directives aim at calculating sufficient capital buffers for the protection of customers and policyholders, FICOD, regulates the supplementary supervision of group risks. This implies that financial entities which have a mutual relationship that affects the risk profiles of both of them must be included in the supervisory scope. In this way, FICOD supplements the sectoral directives, the Banking Directive 2006/48/EC ('CRD') and various insurance directives, all of which can be applied on a solo level, per licensed entity, and on a consolidated level, where all licensed legal entities subject to the same directive are aggregated. A review of FICOD was envisaged some years after its implementation. The review of the FICOD effectively started in 2008 and formed the basis of this legislative proposal. Certain technical issues were included in the Commission's proposal for an Omnibus Directive in October 2009, accompanying the Regulations establishing the new European Supervisory Authorities. During the financial crisis, so-called group risks have materialized all across the financial sector, emphasising the importance of supplementary supervision of inter-linkages within financial groups and among financial institutions. Initiatives similar to the current review were undertaken in the U.S. and Australia, based on the Joint Forum's principles. The Commission intends to proceed in two steps: with the present proposal, the most urgent technical issues identified during the review, as analysed by the Joint Committee on Financial Conglomerates  ('JCFC'), are addressed, including the technical issues detected in earlier review exercises. Calls for advice and a consultation were issued to assess the impact of these potential changes; later in 2010, a more fundamental debate will take place in the context of G20 developments regarding supplementary supervision. This debate is likely to focus on supervisory scope and capital related issues. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: 17 policy options have been developed, assessed and compared with a view to addressing the issues identified in the analysis. Please see the summary of the Commission Staff Working Document (SEC(2010)0981) for further details. Expected impacts of the preferred policy measures concern the following: supplementary supervision on holding company level and supervisory coordination; identification of financial conglomerates; participations. The positively assessed policy changes were expected to render the supplementary supervision framework more robust, leading to more effective risk management incentives and practices. This should be beneficial to the international competitiveness position of EU financial groups. These options should contribute positively to containing the risks to financial stability and the possible costs to society. LEGAL BASE: Article 53(1) TFEU, which is the appropriate legal basis for the harmonisation of rules relating to financialinstitutions and financial conglomerates. CONTENT: the aim of this legislative proposal is to amend the IGD, the FICOD and the CRD in order to eliminate unintended consequences and technical omissions in the sectoral directives and ensure that the objectives of the FICOD are effectively achieved. The main points are as follows: Top level supervision : in order to align supervisory powers at the top level of a conglomerate, to prevent the loss of powers when a group structure changes as well as the duplication of supervision at the conglomerate level, and to facilitate coordination by the most relevant supervisors, the following amendments were positively assessed: include top level holding companies of a banking or an insurance group that are classified as a MFHC, so that provisions and powers that are applied to the former Financial Holding Company (FHC) or Insurance Holding Company (IHC) do not disappear when the classification of a group and its holding company changes as a result of an acquisition in the other sector. In order to ensure that all necessary supervisory tools can be applied, this proposal introduces the term 'mixed financial holding company' into the relevant provisions on consolidated/group supervision in the sectoral directives. Identification of a conglomerate : provisions governing the identification of financial conglomerates give rise to three sub-problems: (i) the directive does not require the inclusion of 'asset management companies' in the threshold tests; (ii) the threshold tests can be based on different parameters with respect to assets and capital requirements. The provisions are ambiguous as regards the calculation of the tests; (iii) the threshold conditions, given their fixed amounts, are not risk-based, and the notion of expected group risks is not addressed by the threshold test. In order to tackle these deficiencies, this proposal introduces the following changes: the draft directive proposes the inclusion of asset management companies at all times. Furthermore 'total assets under management' is introduced as an alternative indicator and there is included the option of proving guidelines on the application of the relevant provisions; a waiver for smaller groups is introduced, allowing for guidelines for the application of the waiver to smaller groups; the text is re-worded properly to distinguish the applicable conditions for groups below and above the EUR 6 billion threshold and adds requirements as to possible guidelines for the application of the waiver to larger groups and thus ensures a level playing field. Treatment of participations : the consistent treatment of participations in day-to-day supplementary supervision is hampered by the lack of relevant information to properly assess group risks. For example, if information about risks with respect to participations in insurance and reinsurance companies cannot be obtained by bank-led conglomerates, they cannot provide their supervisors with the evidence of a satisfactory level of integration of management and internal control with these entities that is necessary for consolidation. In that case, the group needs to deduct such participations from their capital. While the issue of information on minority participations is not yet fully examined, a first step contained in this proposal is the introduction of a waiver where participation is the only trigger for identification. As long as national company law provisions may hamper the fulfilment of requirements, specific treatment in view of risk concentration and intra group transaction requirements is allowed and may be specified via guidelines. Guidelines may also support the consistent application of supervisory review processes, including specific treatment of participations, as provided for in FICOD, CRD and Solvency II. Other issues : the proposal deals with the following matters: it updates certain definitions in the directives; it amends the definition of relevant competent authority and supervisory coordination: certain provisions in FICOD leave room for different interpretations as regards the identification of the relevant competent authorities. An extensive interpretation results in a high number of authorities that must be consulted by the coordinator at the financial conglomerate level. This may undermine the efficient coordination of the work to be carried out by the ""college"" of a coordinator and relevant competent authorities; deletion of the third calculation method: FICOD lists three methods for calculating capital at the conglomerate level. An analysis showed that the third eligible capital calculation method always results in outcomes that are significantly different from methods 1 (consolidation) and 2 (deduction and aggregation). Therefore, the third method should be deleted. By restricting the eligible calculation methods to the consolidation and the deduction and aggregation method, FICOD is also aligned to the sectoral directives it supplements; inclusion of reinsurance undertakings: with the introduction of authorisation and supervision of reinsurance undertakings in Directive 2005/68/EC, reinsurance undertakings were included in the scope of regulated entities that can be part of a financial conglomerate. Consequently, a reference to reinsurance undertakings has to be included in FICOD; introduction of provisions regarding guidelines in certain areas: in order to allow for further convergence of supervisory practices, a possibility for the European Banking Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority to issue guidelines is introduced. These guidelines should reflect the supplementary nature of this Directive. By way of example, when assessing risk concentrations on a group wide basis relating to several risk types potentially materializing throughout the group (interest rate risk, market risk, etc.), this assessment should complement the specific supervision of for example large exposures as provided for in the CRD. Guidelines may also support the consistent application of the different supervisory review processes, including specific treatment of participations, as provided for in FICOD, CRD and Solvency II. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the budget of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 97/9/EC on Investor-Compensation Schemes (ICSD) provides for clients receiving investment services from investment firms to be compensated in specific circumstances where the firm is unable to return money or financial instruments that it holds on the client's behalf. In recent years, the Commission has received numerous investor complaints about the application of the ICSD in a number of important cases involving large investor losses. The complaints relate to the coverage and funding of schemes and delays in obtaining compensation. The main problem with the application of the Directive is the large margin for discretion it grants to Member States. Moreover, there are issues such as the current non-compensation of investors who, due to the default of a depositary or third party, cannot recover their assets or suffer a loss in the value of their units or shares in a UCITS. These need to be addressed at EU level, since other solutions could fragment the protection of investors in the EU markets. An additional element relates to the fact that through the amendment of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (Directive 94/19/EC), the level of protection for bank depositors was increased. Moreover, the functioning of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DSG) is being modified (see COD/2010/0207). Investment firms should not be undermined due to the increase of protection in the bank deposits sector. Therefore it is necessary to assess the level of protection of investors at EU level, to take into account any regulatory change that might have consequences in the field of investments. This initiative is part of a broader package on compensation and guarantee schemes that will comprise two proposals for amendment of the Directives on Investor Compensation Schemes and on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and a White Paper on the insurance schemes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options were mainly related to the funding of the schemes, the payout delays, the coverage of the compensation and the level of compensation. Each policy option was assessed against the following criteria: investor protection and confidence, level playing field in the protection provided for different types of investments or services in the EU and cost-effectiveness that is the extent to which the option achieves the sought objectives and facilitates the operation of securities markets in a cost effective and efficient way. LEGAL BASE: Article 53(1) of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal aims at improving the practical functioning of the ICSD, at clarifying the scope of the ICSD taking into account the financial crisis and recent changes in the EU regulatory landscape, at reducing gaps in the regulatory system and disparities between the protection of clients of investment firms and of banking depositors. In the light of the existing differences in the functioning of the schemes at national level, the proposal introduces common rules to ensure a degree of harmonisation in the funding of the schemes and in the day-to-day practice. It also introduces a provision of a borrowing mechanism among national schemes as a last resort tool to compensate any temporary needs from schemes, subject to a rigorous assessment carried out by the European Securities and Markets Authority and to the obligation to repay any loan within the maximum period of five years. The main points are as follows: Alignment with MiFID - services covered and classification of clients : the scope of the ICSD is currently cross-referenced to investment services as defined under the Investment Services Directive (Council Directive 93/22/EEC). The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC on MiFID) has repealed the ISD and broadened the scope of services covered under the sectoral legislation (e.g the operation of Multilateral Trading Facilities is included in the scope of MiFID). A number of technical issues have also arisen, such as the coverage of firms depending on the scope of their authorisation (i.e. whether the firm is authorised to hold client assets or not). The proposed amendment clarifies that all investment services and activities covered under MiFID should be subject to the ICSD and that if firms hold client assets (irrespective of restrictions on their authorisation or the nature of their investment service) then clients should be entitled to compensation under the ICSD. Another amendment deriving from MiFID provisions concerns the classification of clients. National legislation in Member States may provide that professional and institutional investors can be excluded from coverage under the ICSD. However, since the ICSD pre-dates the MiFID, the list of professional and institutional investors under the ICSD does not coincide with the corresponding list under MiFID. The proposal aligns the classification of clients in the ICSD with the MiFID definition of clients considered as professional. This will ensure consistency between the two Directives, and result in better protection for medium-sized enterprises which may currently be excluded from the protection granted by the ICSD and are instead normally classified as retail clients under the MiFID. Failure of a third party custodian: the ICSD protects investors when a firm is unable to return financial instruments or money held on a client's behalf in connection with investment services. Under MiFID, financial instruments can be held in two different ways: (i) by the investment firm itself holding financial instruments for a client, or (ii) by a custodian usually selected by the firm. Investors may not only be exposed to the failure of the firm, but also to the potential failure of a custodian. In a case where a third party custodian is not able to return the financial instruments to its client, the client will not be able to benefit from any payment by the compensation scheme established under the ICSD. As a result, there is a difference in the level of protection provided for investors who have purchased a financial instrument, depending on whether the firm itself or a third party custodian holds their assets. The proposal extends compensation to investors for claims relating to the failure of a firm to return financial instruments due to the failure of a third party custodian. Failure of a UCITS depositary : the management of Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is not a MiFID investment service. As a result the ICSD does not cover UCITS and their units' holders in cases where losses are suffered due to the failure of a UCITS depositary or sub-custodian. This situation however is comparable, in substance, to the one described above where losses are suffered due to the failure of an investment firm custodian or sub-custodian. As a consequence, the proposed measure will give UCITS holders the right to be compensated by the investor-compensation scheme if the assets cannot be returned to the UCITS, because of the failure of a UCITS depositary or sub-custodian. The cost of this extension in coverage should be borne by these entities rather than investment firms. Exclusion of claims involving market abuse: the ICSD excludes claims where a criminal conviction has been obtained for money laundering but not claims by investors who have engaged in market abuse. The proposal modifies the relevant provisions so that the ICSD will explicitly exclude any claim for compensation where the investor has engaged in actions that are prohibited under Directive 2003/6/EC on insider dealing and market manipulation. The investors who have committed these acts should be excluded from compensation. Level of compensation : the ICSD harmonises the minimum level of compensation (EUR 20 000) for each investor, and this was aligned with the one set under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (EUR 20 000 at the time). But the compensation limit of EUR 20 000 was never adjusted to reflect inflation or the increased exposure of European investors to financial instruments since the ICSD entered into force. Furthermore, the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) was recently amended to provide for at least EUR 50 000 per depositor per credit institution, to be increased to a fixed level of EUR 100 000. The Commission proposes to increase the level of compensation to a fixed amount of EUR 50 000. As some Member States have currently a higher level of compensation, a grandfathering clause of three years will allow them to adapt to the EUR 50 000 coverage level. In the case of credit institutions doubts may arise as to the coverage under the ICSD rather than the DGSD of monies deposited in a bank in the context of the provision of investment services. To deal with situations of possible uncertainty due to the specific nature of banks which may provide both banking activity and investment services, the ICSD is being amended to specify that in cases of doubt the investor is to be compensated under the DGSD (which provided a higher level of coverage). Funding principles : the broad discretion under the ICSD about how to fund schemes (e.g. ex ante or ex post, in respect of the occurrence of any loss events) and huge differences in the way funding is organised by individual Member States create a number of problems. A new article is introduced specifying the basic principles about the funding of the investor-compensation schemes. In particular: in principle, the cost of financing schemes should continue to be borne by market participants; the schemes should be adequately financed in proportion to their potential liabilities; in order to provide a sufficient level of funding, a minimum target fund level will be established for all the schemes. This target fund level will be fully ex ante funded. Taking into account the current differences at national level, the target fund level should initially be reached within a 10-year period; when, in concrete cases, the ex ante funds are not sufficient to cover the liabilities of a scheme, additional calls for contributions from entities covered under the scheme should be ensured. However, they should not jeopardise the stability of the financial system of the Member State ; once these funding sources have been exhausted, the scheme may have recourse to borrowing from other compensation schemes; access to further multiple funding sources has to be ensured, including borrowing facilities; schemes should publish details about their level of funding. Borrowing last resort mechanism between national schemes : together with the establishment of consistent funding rules between Member States, the introduction of cooperation arrangements among national schemes will provide greater protection to investors and promote investor confidence in investment services. The system is based on the principle of solidarity between the national schemes. A borrowing mechanism among schemes is introduced as a last resort tool. These measures should provide schemes with an alternative back up source of funding, under specific conditions and on a temporary basis. Detailed funding principles and a repayment (mid-term) obligation upon the borrowing scheme will limit the risk of moral hazard between undersized and better funded schemes. Under the proposal: schemes should have the right to borrow from the other schemes if their funds are insufficient to cover their immediate needs; a portion of ex-ante funding in each compensation scheme will have to be available for lending to other schemes; ESMA should receive any borrowing request, assess whether the relevant requirements are met and, if this is the case, transmit it to the other schemes; loans should be repaid to the lending schemes at the latest after 5 years since the request. Interests should accrue on the loans; the interest rate shall be equivalent to the marginal lending facility rate of the ECB; the borrowing mechanism should be limited to the claims covered under the Directive. For instance, schemes will not be able to borrow for any needs arising from the default of entities not included in the scope of the directive; a limit of 20% of the portion set aside for lending may be used for each case. Compensation limit (""co-insurance principle""): the ICSD allows Member states to limit the coverage of the compensation to a specified percentage (equal to or exceeding 90%) of an investor's claim. The reason for this option in the ICSD was to encourage investors to take some care in choosing investment firms, but it is unrealistic to expect retail investors to be able to identify which firms are more or less likely to be affected by fraud or systems failures. Eliminating this option will provide increased investor protection under the ICSD as clients will no longer have to bear part of the loss if there is fraud at a firm or other problems with the firm's systems. Moreover, the provision giving Member States the option of excluding from coverage of the compensation scheme funds in currencies other than of the Member States’ is eliminated. This provides better protection to investors as it ensures that clients' funds are covered irrespective of the currency involved. Payout delays: the ICSD establishes a strict deadline for reimbursement (at the latest within three months). However, processing claims takes considerably longer than the limits set, possibly up to several years as evidenced by recent cases. The proposed amendment introduces the obligation for schemes to provisionally pay partial compensation based on an initial assessment of the claim if payout delay exceeds a specified time period. The level of the partial payment will amount to one third of the initial assessment of the claim. The balance will be paid out later once the claim had been fully verified. Schemes will also need the ability to recover amounts provisionally paid out if it was subsequently determined that the claim was not in fact valid. The amendments also provide that a competent authority must make a determination of whether a firm is unable to meet its obligations to investors within three months. This is to mitigate concerns about individual cases where competent authorities could be very slow to make a determination. Investor information : the ICSD requires Member States to ensure that investment firms make available to investors information about the relevant investor compensation scheme including the amount and scope of cover. Information must be made available in a readily comprehensible manner. However, concerns have been raised about how this provision has been applied in practice in the Member States. The directive is amended to require that UCITS managers disclose to investors in clear terms what is effectively covered by schemes (e.g. investment risk is usually not covered). Under this proposal the existing obligation for investment firms to provide information about compensation schemes to new clients will be supplemented by requiring further detail to be provided about what is compensated under the ICSD and how it applies in cross border situations and require them to clearly explain that certain losses (e.g. due to investment risks) are not subject to the payment of compensation under the ICSD. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed establish a comprehensive legal framework for the authorisation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which is fully applicable to GMOs to be used for cultivation purposes throughout the EU as seeds or other plant propagating material. Under this set of legislation, GMOs for cultivation shall undergo an individual risk assessment before being authorised to be placed on the Union market. The aim of this authorisation procedure is to ensure a high level of protection of human life and health, animal health and welfare, the environment and consumer interests, whilst ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market. Once a GMO is authorised for cultivation purposes in accordance with the EU legislative framework on GMOs and complies, as regards the variety that is to be placed on the market, with the requirements of EU legislation on the marketing of seed and plant propagating material, Member States are not authorised to prohibit, restrict, or impede its free circulation within their territory, except under the conditions defined by EU legislation. Experience has shown that cultivation of GMOs is an issue which is more thoroughly addressed by Member States, either at central or at regional and local level. Contrary to issues related to the placing on the market and the import of GMOs, which should remain regulated at EU level to preserve the internal market, cultivation has been acknowledged as an issue with a strong local/regional dimension. In accordance with Article 2(2) TFEU Member States should therefore be entitled to have a possibility to adopt rules concerning the effective cultivation of GMOs in their territory after the GMO has been legally authorised to be placed on the EU market. In this context, it appears appropriate to grant to Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, more freedom to decide whether or not they wish to cultivate GMO crops on their territory without changing the system of Union authorisations of GMOs and independently of the measures that Member States are entitled to take by application of Article 26a of Directive 2001/18/EC to avoid the unintended presence of GMOs in other products. IMPACT ASSESSEMENT: the Commission considers that the amendment of the legislation is necessary to get the right balance between maintaining the EU system of authorisations based on the scientific assessment of health and environmental risks and the need to grant freedom to Member States to address specific national or local aspects raised by the cultivation of GMOs. This approach, while preserving the EU authorisation system of GMOs as well as the free circulation and import of GM food, feed and seeds, is expected to address the demands of several Member States and receive public support. It is also estimated that the potential economic and social benefits of this proposal are likely to outweigh the potential disadvantages. Member States may be in a more appropriate position to carry out their own impact assessments to justify their decisions about cultivation of GMOs in their territories at national/regional/local levels. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 2001/18/EC by introducing a new Article which allows Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of authorised GMOs in part or all of their territories on grounds other than those covered by the environmental risk assessment under the EU authorisation system and those related to avoiding the unintended presence of GMOs in other products. This amendment will apply to GMOs authorised for cultivation either under Directive 2001/18/EC or Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 which also covers applications for cultivation if they concern GMOs that are intended as source materials for the further production of food and feed. It will equally apply to cultivation of all varieties of seed and plant propagating material placed on the market in accordance with relevant EU legislation. The freedom which Member States will obtain will only concern the act of GMO cultivation, but not the placing on the market and import of authorised GM seeds which must continue unimpeded within the framework of the internal market and the respective international obligations of the Union. The proposal sets out two series of conditions under which Member States can take measures: As the assessment of the safety of GMOs for human/animal health and the environment is carried out at EU level, Member States have the possibility under the existing legal framework to invoke the special procedures of the safeguard clause of Directive 2001/18/EC (Article 23) or the emergency measure of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 (Article 34) in case they have serious grounds to consider that the authorised product is likely to constitute a serious risk to health and environment. Consequently, the proposal stipulates that Member States cannot invoke protection of health and environment to justify a national ban of cultivation of GMOs outside these special procedures. Member States can thus invoke grounds (other than those covered by the environmental risk assessment under the EU authorisation system) to restrict or prohibit cultivation of GMOs in their territories. The measures taken by the Member States have to be in conformity with the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular as regards the principle of non-discrimination between national and non-national products and the provisions on quantitative restrictions of trade between Member States (Articles 34 and 36 TFEU). They should finally be consistent with the international obligations of the EU, and in particular with the ones established under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no financial implications for the Union budget. It will have no impact on small or medium-sized undertakings different than the impact of the current situation."

Recalling that poverty reduction and eradication is the EU's primary development policy objective and one of the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Members call for more resolute to enhance the impact of EU development aid. The following recommendations are made to this effect: High-impact development policy : reiterating its call for incorporation of the EDF into the EU budget, Members call for the strengthening of aid effectiveness. Efforts must be made in order to: better assess the projects and policies funded by the EU; enhance the promotion of good governance and the fight against corruption in beneficiary countries; enhance capacity development to improve the capability of citizens, organisations, governments and societies to design sustainable development strategies; enhance democratic ownership (parliaments, local and regional authorities, civil society and other stakeholders); enable meaningful participation for citizens in Civil Society Organisations; highlight the role played by local and regional authorities and their networks. Parliament stresses that the aim of increasing the impact of aid and obtaining more results/value for money should not lead to a risk-averse development policy that only focuses on ‘easy countries’. The resolution insists that poverty eradication and needs must remain the crucial criteria for the allocation of EU development aid and that aid effectiveness must be improved by focusing on tangible results. They call on the Commission and the Member States to review the scope of financing instruments and to focus the disbursement of Official Development Assistance (ODA) on the poorest and most vulnerable countries and on reaching the poorest layers of society particularly those facing the greatest risks of social exclusion, such as women, children, elderly people and people with disabilities while taking into consideration the results achieved and the impact of aid. Parliament stresses the need to distinguish between the development needs of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and those of the Middle Income Countries (MICs), especially the emerging donors (to recall, 72% of the world's poor live in MICs). Furthermore, Parliament takes the view that the EU's development policy should aim at eliminating obstacles to development, such as dumping of agricultural products, illegitimate debt burden, capital flight and unfair trade, and at creating an international environment conducive to fighting poverty, guaranteeing decent incomes and livelihoods and to the fulfilment of basic human rights, including social and economic rights. It reiterates the principle of the universality of human rights. It believes that in order to guarantee high impact the EU development policy should have an incentive-based approach based on greater differentiation by rewarding those countries that are performing well and supporting those that are most off track. Meeting financial commitments : Parliament reaffirms its position according to which the collective target of devoting 0.7% of the Union’s Gross National Income (GNI) to ODA by 2015 must be met. It urges the Commission and Member States to find new sources of development funding such as a financial transaction tax at global level, private-sector finance and market-orientated solutions. They oppose any alteration or broadening of the definition of ODA, as set by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. Once again, Members call for increased efforts in the areas of development education and awareness-raising in Europe. Members underline that aid should be provided in a predictable manner that is aligned with national plans and priorities and provides incentives for greater transparency and accountability from donor governments, NGOs, and partner states. Promoting pro-poor growth : Parliament stresses that growth is only one instrument among many, and that maximising growth is not equivalent to maximising development. The impact of growth on poverty eradication could be much higher if inequality were reduced and human rights respected. Members insist, therefore, that EU development assistance must be geared towards pro-poor growth through the adoption of measures which specifically focus on the poor and the marginalized in order to foster an increase in their share of national wealth and allow them to become a driving force for genuinely inclusive growth, such as micro-credit and micro-finance, as well as other market-derived solutions. The resolution stresses that economic growth policies cannot succeed without promotion of social and environmental standards and the implementation of social protection mechanisms. Further measures are laid down: favour measures which provide security of land tenure and facilitate poor people’s access to land, markets, credits and other financial services and skills development; promote industrial development and the development of infrastructure ; limit the effects of greenhouse gas emissions; strengthen large-scale export and property rights; diversify the economies of developing countries and reducing their dependence on imports need to be priority objectives for policies supporting growth; Human development : Parliament emphasises that the provision of basic social services is crucial to pro-poor growth and reaching the MDGs. It calls for 20% of all EU assistance to be earmarked for basic social services. Members underline that girls’ education and the promotion of gender equality in education are vital to development, and that policies and actions that do not address gender disparities miss critical development opportunities. The resolution stresses the importance of bridging financing gaps in health systems resulting from priorities such as sexual and reproductive health suffering cuts, and emphasises the importance of investing in the fight against HIV/AIDS and other diseases. It reiterates its view that the EU must support partner countries in developing fair, transparent and effective tax systems to generate the revenues needed for social protection and pro-poor policies, and must at an international level continue to work for greater financial transparency and to ensure that partner countries share the benefits. Involving the private sector : Parliament recalls that 90% of jobs in developing countries are in the private sector. EU development aid should focus on financing for domestic companies, leveraging of domestic capitals and encouraging recipient countries to create an environment conducive to the development of small, medium-sized and micro-enterprises and on the removal of barriers to formalisation, access to capital and affordable credit and that services and capacity-building should be targeted in particular on poorer entrepreneurs. In this context, Parliament calls on the Commission to: promote and support, among other things, social-economy enterprises that work in accordance with ethical and economic principles; strengthen public investments in public goods, infrastructure and services; object to any kind of cooperation with private entities which would contribute directly or indirectly to any form of tax evasion or tax avoidance; favour investors that support the partner country’s development strategy, and to give preferential treatment to domestic and regional investors in order to promote regional integration; strengthen Public Private Partnerships (PPP), which involve the private sector in development; fight corruption, within both businesses and NGOs, as well as in governments and public authorities. Members call on the EU to meet its Aid for Trade Strategy commitments on development assistance specifically targeted at projects designed to help developing countries develop their trade-related skills, improve the supply chain and ultimately compete in regional and global markets. Climate change, energy and sustainable development : Parliament prioritises support for local and regional sustainable energy solutions, and decentralised energy production in particular, so as to bring development priorities in line with environmental concerns. It notes the huge potential for renewable energy (solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy and biomass) in many developing countries. Parliament reiterates that developed countries have a duty to take the lead in building the low-carbon global economy needed to achieve the necessary emission cuts. It encourages Member States to take the lead in cutting emissions. The resolution calls for a holistic approach which integrates the environmental dimension in development programmes and projects for example by improving regulations concerning waste transfer and illegal logging. T he Commission is called upon to assess the impact of ‘climate migration’, a phenomenon that some estimate will cause 200 million people to leave their homes by 2050 as conditions in their lands gradually worsen and emphasises that the European Union must contribute through its development policy to providing assistance and reducing the number of refugees, by investing in technologies, human resources and financial aid. Parliament reiterates its position that mainstreaming cannot replace the provision of new and additional resources which the EU and other donors have committed towards developing countries climate change mitigation efforts and adaptation needs. Food security and agriculture : Parliament reiterates its position that the EU should focus its development assistance on safeguarding the food security of developing countries and promoting sustainable, local, small-scale and organic agricultural production. It calls in particular for: a switch to organic and ecologically sustainable farming; specific support to women in agriculture; the root causes of food insecurity, including weak accountability for the right to food, food-price speculation and ‘land grabbing’ should be addressed. Members recall that, in order to feed a world population expected to surpass 9 billion in 2050, agricultural output will have to increase by 70% between now and then, using less land, less water and fewer pesticides. They note that global food security is a question of the utmost urgency for the European Union and calls for immediate and consistent action to ensure food security both for EU citizens and at the global level. The resolution underlines that tackling food insecurity means implementing many measures in diverse sectors, such as the management of local natural resources, the reinforcement of production and manufacturing, training, the structuring of professional organisations, the implementation of a safety net for the most vulnerable, the education on nutrition and also the diversification of rural jobs beyond agriculture to enhance the income of rural families, who are the first victims of hunger. Parliament expresses its deep concern about the current farmland acquisition by government-backed foreign investors, particularly in Africa, which risks undermining local food security and causing unforeseen and far-reaching social unrest if it is not properly handled. Transparency : lastly, in order to increase transparency and public acceptance of development projects funded fully or partially by the EU or the Member States, Parliament calls for creating an electronic data base that provides information on ODA."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) stipulates that a unanimously adopted Council Regulation shall lay down a multiannual financial framework. The financial framework shall determine the amounts of the annual ceilings on commitment appropriations by category of expenditure and of the annual ceiling on payment appropriations and it shall lay down any other provisions required for the annual budgetary procedure to run smoothly. The practice to adopt a multiannual financial framework and provisions on the interinstitutional cooperation and budgetary discipline started more than 20 years ago. It has immensely improved and simplified the annual budget procedure and cooperation between institutions and, as a consequence, increased the budgetary discipline. The current multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 was agreed between institutions in May 2006 and is laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (the IIA). With the entry into force of the TFEU, the relevant provisions of the current IIA need to be codified into a Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework (the MFF regulation). This codification represents an alignment of the provisions of the current IIA with the requirements of the Treaty. However, this alignment has to take into account the change of instrument, i.e. a regulation instead of an IIA. For legal reasons, it is, however, neither possible nor feasible to transpose all the provisions of the current IIA into the MFF regulation. Some of the provisions of the current IIA became obsolete with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, many shall be incorporated in this MFF regulation, and some in the revised Financial Regulation. A new IIA is still necessary for those provisions that do not fit into either of these two regulations and incorporate them into the framework of a revised IIA (provisions on interinstitutional cooperation, in particular). Taking into account all the relevant provisions and requirements of the Treaty, the current proposal seeks to focus on the financial framework in the strictest sense (e.g. annual adjustments of the financial framework, revision of the financial framework…). Some of the other provisions previously in the IIA have become obsolete (i) provisions related to the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and the maximum rate of increase, (ii) the classification of expenditure, (iii) significant parts of inter-institutional cooperation are either inappropriate for a regulation of this type and should fall within the financial regulation (rather than in the MFF regulation) or in the IIA. The remaining provisions – mainly issues relating to pure interinstitutional cooperation – are included in a new IIA which is the subject of a separate procedure. For the sake of integrity, the draft MFF Regulation and the new IIA are presented together and should be negotiated and agreed as one integral package. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) – special legislative procedure. CONTENT: since 1988, the multiannual financial framework and related provisions have been laid down in interinstitutional agreements. The multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 was established by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 (the IIA). With the entry into force of the TFEU, the practice of fixing the financial framework by interinstitutional agreement has to be reviewed and the multiannual financial framework has to be laid down in the form of a regulation. This is the purpose of this proposal which integrates the appropriate provisions of the old IIA and takes into account, where required, of the amendments that are required by the new Treaty. As a result, the IIA is to be amended as follows: maintenance of the current financial framework: the financial framework has not been changed; an obligation to respect the ceilings on expenditures of budgetary heading s and the ceilings on own resources: as before, the annual ceilings are retained, as well as the requirement for the institutions to respect these ceilings during the budgetary procedure. Should the ceilings for payment appropriations result in a call-in rate for own resources exceeding the own resources ceiling, the ceilings of the financial framework have to be adjusted; the possibility to exceed the ceilings under certain conditions: provision is made for the possibility to exceed the ceilings, if necessary, when the instruments not included in the financial framework are mobilised, i.e. the Emergency Aid Reserve, the Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (these instruments are now defined in the new IIA). They are not included in the financial framework and ensure that financing in specific circumstances is provided in excess of the ceilings of the financial framework, if it is required. They increase the flexibility of the financial framework and are mobilised jointly by the two arms of budgetary authority; rules on annual technical adjustment of the financial framework are unchanged: the rules agreed regarding the annual technical adjustment of the financial framework are unchanged (revaluation of the financial framework at year n+1 prices and on the basis of a fixed deflator of 2% a year); adjustment of cohesion policy envelopes : the wording in this part has only been slightly changed. The reference to the current IIA was replaced with the reference to the period when the cohesion policy envelopes were agreed. The adjustment of cohesion policy envelopes will be made in the technical adjustment for the year 2011, to be presented in April 2010. This adjustment will take place if it is established that cumulated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of any Member State for the years 2007-2009 has diverged by more than +/- 5 % from the cumulated GDP estimated in 2005 for the establishment of cohesion policy envelopes for Member States for the period 2007-2013; adjustments related to excessive government deficit : the wording of these articles has either not changed or only changed very marginally (reference to the voting rules for the adaptation of implementation conditions, in particular); revision of the financial framework : the revisions of the financial framework are adopted according to the same rules as the regulation itself. In order to retain the current level of flexibility of the financial framework as regards the revisions below the threshold of 0.03% of GNI, paragraph 3 stipulates that the financial framework may be adapted, if need be, and within the threshold of 0.03%, in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure. This does not change the current practice where revisions below the same threshold were jointly decided by Parliament and Council, with Council deciding by qualified majority. It should be noted that the rules regarding the revision of the financial framework in the event of a revision of the Treaty or enlargement have not been revised; interinstitutional cooperation in the budgetary procedure : this article lays down the general principles in regard to interinstitutional cooperation in the context of the budgetary procedure: i) the principle of good faith between the institutions throughout the procedure with a view to reconciling their positions; ii) appropriate interinstitutional contacts to monitor the progress of the work; iii) coordination of their respective calendars of work to enable proceedings to be conducted in a coherent and convergent fashion; iv) the retention of the principle of interinstitutional trilogues at all stages of the procedure to facilitate agreement on the budget. The technical details of the cooperation are included in the new IIA; financing of the CFSP: the financing of the Common Foreign and Security Policy has a special standing during the budgetary procedure. In order to maintain the current balance and to help the budgetary procedure to run smoothly, the basic rules (the amount entered in one budget chapter covering the real predictable needs, no funds entered in a reserve) and the amount agreed for the financing of the CFSP (without change) are introduced in the MFF Regulation. The total amount of operating CFSP expenditure shall be entered entirely in one budget chapter, entitled CFSP. That amount shall cover the real predictable needs, assessed in the framework of the establishment of the draft budget, on the basis of forecasts drawn up annually by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and a reasonable margin for unforeseen actions. No funds may be entered in a reserve. An amount of at least EUR 1 740 million shall be available for the CFSP over the period 2007-2013; consequences of the absence of a financial framework: overall, the rules relating to the duration of the financial framework and the consequences of the absence of a financial framework are retained. The obligation for the Commission to present a new financial framework before July 2011 is also maintained. Minor changes have been made to align with the wording of the TFEU; entry into force: it is planned that the new IIA will enter into force on the same day as this proposed regulation. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget. It corresponds to the financial framework as revised for the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), adopted by the Council and Parliament on 17 December 2009."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union is in a process of significant population ageing. According to Eurostat's latest projections released in 2008, there would be only two people of working age (15-64) for every person aged over 65 in the EU by 2060 compared to a ratio of four to one today. The strongest push in this direction is expected to occur during the period 2015-35 when the baby boom cohorts will be in retirement. This shift is due to a combination of low birth rates and rising life expectancy. These demographic changes present both challenges and opportunities. Population ageing may increase pressure on public budgets and pension systems, as well as on the staffing of social and care services for older people. There is a fear that the older generations might become too heavy a burden on younger, working-age people and that this could result in tensions between generations. This view neglects, however, the significant actual and potential contribution that older people — and the baby-boom cohorts in particular — can make to society. A key opportunity for tackling the challenge of demographic ageing and preserving intergenerational solidarity consists therefore in ensuring that the baby-boom cohorts stay longer in the labour market and remain healthy, active and autonomous as long as possible. In the framework of the Employment Strategy, Member States have started to reverse the trend to early retirement so that the EU-27 employment rate for people aged 55-64 has increased from 36.9% in 2000 to 46% in 2009. Encouraging older workers to stay in employment requires notably the improvement of working conditions and their adaptation to the health status and needs of older workers, updating their skills by providing better access to life long learning and the review of tax and benefit systems to ensure that there are effective incentives for working longer. Active ageing is also an effective tool for tackling poverty in old age. In 2008, 19% of people aged 65+ in the EU were at risk of poverty. A considerable number of older people experience old age as a time of marginalisation. While better employment opportunities for older people could help tackle some of the causes of poverty among this age group, active participation in voluntary activities could reduce the isolation of older people. The huge potential that older persons represent for society as volunteers or carers could be better mobilised by eliminating existing obstacles to unpaid work and by providing the right framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: current activities at EU level do not seem properly geared to dealing with what needs to be done: raise awareness among the general public, policy makers and other stakeholders of the importance of active ageing and of the need to do more to mobilise the potential of the baby boom cohorts; foster an exchange of information and experience between Member States and stakeholders; give Member States and stakeholders an opportunity to develop policies by way of specific activities and by committing to specific objectives. The Commission considers that broad-based support will be required at all levels of society and from a wide range of stakeholders. The key challenge is to mobilise stakeholders in a way that will generate significant action at national, regional, local and company levels across the EU. With greater political momentum and visibility for active ageing policies, policy makers can be encouraged to take more ambitious initiatives. It is for this reason that implementation of the European Year for Active Ageing could be useful. LEGAL BASE: Article 153(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the year 2012 shall be designated as the European Year for Active Ageing. Objectives : the overall purpose of the European Year shall be to encourage and support the efforts of Member States, their regional and local authorities, social partners and civil society to promote active ageing and to do more to mobilise the potential of the rapidly growing population in their late 50s and above, thereby preserving solidarity between generations. Active ageing means creating better opportunities and working conditions to enable older workers to play their part in the labour market, combating social exclusion by fostering active participation in society, and encouraging healthy ageing. On this basis, the objectives shall be: to raise general awareness of the value of active ageing in order to highlight the useful contribution older persons make to society and the economy, to promote active ageing and to do more to mobilise the potential of older persons; to stimulate debate and develop mutual learning between Member States and stakeholders at all levels in order to promote active ageing policies, to identify and disseminate good practice and to encourage cooperation and synergies; to offer a framework for commitment and concrete action to enable Member States and stakeholders at all levels to develop policies through specific activities and to commit to specific objectives related to active ageing. Activities :the measures to be taken to achieve the objectives the following activities at Union, national, regional or local level: conferences, events and initiatives to promote debate, raise awareness and foster the making of specific commitments; information, promotion and educational campaigns; exchange of information, experience and good practices; research and surveys on a Union or national scale, and dissemination of the results. The Year should be seen as the highlight of a major effort spanning the period 2011-2014, during which the EU would focus many of its programmes and policies on the issue of active ageing and put in place a framework in which new initiatives and partnerships supporting active ageing at all levels (Member State, regional, local, social partners, civil society) can be encouraged and publicised. In 2011, public authorities, social partners and civil society organisations at all levels would be encouraged to commit themselves to specific goals related to active ageing; the focus would be on achievements during the European Year. The goals would be documented on a European website which would then become the website for the European Year and would also serve as a tool for monitoring and evaluation. In 2012, the focus of the European Year would be on starting to implement the commitments made during 2011, on raising awareness among the general public, publicising these initiatives through media activities and the involvement of other multipliers. Results of active ageing projects funded under existing budget lines and programmes would be presented. The primary intention is to promote active ageing in employment by creating better opportunities for the participation of older workers, and to promote active ageing in society, by combating social exclusion through voluntary work, healthy ageing and autonomous living. Coordination at Union level : the Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators for the purpose of coordination at Union level and to exchange information, including on commitments made and their implementation in the Member States. The European Parliament, the Member States, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions will be associated in the activities. Evaluation : by 30 June 2014, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in this Decision. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: no additional funding is sought for the European Year. The flexibility for annual or multiannual priority-setting based on the budget lines and programmes of the Directorate General for Employment and other relevant programmes provides sufficient financial margin for running the Year on a scale similar to previous European Years. The administrative resources can also come from existing administrative budgets."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: the Frontex Agency was set up in 2004 and became operational in 2005. In 2008, the commission adopted a Communication on the evaluation and future development of the FRONTEX Agency, accompanied by a impact assessment. The Communication issued recommendations for the short to medium term and launched ideas for the future development of the Agency in the longer term. It was welcomed by the Council and the European Parliament, who both shared the Commissions assessment that the Agency had been very successful since its inception and called for a further strengthening of the Agency. An independent evaluation also took place during 2008, on the basis of which the Frontex Management Board made a series of recommendations concerning changes to the legal basis of the Agency. This proposal reflects all recommendations of the 2008 Communication and the Management Board recommendations to the extent they require a revision of the legal framework of the Agency, with the exceptions as described in the impact assessment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment has been carried out - Commission staff working document SEC(2010)0149. The preferred option of the impact assessment consists of a combination of the following sub-options: a revised mechanism with compulsory contributions of equipment from Member States combined with the gradual acquisition/leasing by Frontex of its own equipment, based on further analyses of needs and costs; a revised mechanism with compulsory contributions of human resources from Member States combined with a pool of border guards on semi-permanent detachment from Member States to Frontex, with the status of national experts; awarding the Agency a co-leading role for the implementation of joint operations, with detailed rules for the operational plan, evaluation, and incident reporting, to be enforced by Frontex; allowing Frontex to finance and implement technical assistance projects in third countries and to deploy liaison officers in third countries; giving Frontex a limited mandate to process personal data related to fight against criminal networks organising illegal immigration, under condition that such processing of personal data by Frontex is lawful, necessary and proportionate in relation to the tasks of the Agency; giving Frontex a coordinating role in implementing joint return operations; giving Frontex a mandate to analyse operational risks and requirements in the Member States. The preferred option is fully reflected in this legislative proposal with the exception of giving Frontex a limited mandate to process personal data related to fighting criminal networks organising illegal immigration. The Commission does consider that all possibilities to reinforce the fight against the smuggling of migrants and against trafficking of human beings should be explored. However, it prefers to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategy for information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflection to be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between Agencies in the justice and home affairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 74 and 77 (1) (b) and (c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The proposal is within the limits set by these provisions and, in particular, respects the shared competencies of the Treaty in that Member States remain responsible for controlling their external borders. Notably this proposal upholds the principle that in the context of operations coordinated by the Agency, guest officers may only perform tasks and exercise powers under instructions from and, as a general rule, in the presence of border guards of the host Member State. Decisions to refuse entry in accordance with the Schengen Borders Code shall be taken only by border guards of the host Member State. No decision-making power in this regard is transferred to the Agency. The objectives of this proposal, while respecting the same fundamental limitations of the existing provisions, are to further develop an integrated management of operational cooperation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. CONTENT: the Commission presents a proposal to strengthen the FRONTEX Agency. The most important amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 reflect the changes necessary to accommodate the preferred option of the impact assessment. Moreover a number of minor amendments of an essentially administrative character have been introduced taking into account the Management Board recommendations as well as the introduction of new ""standard"" provisions used in other Commission proposals for the setting up of new Agencies. The main amendments to the Regulation are as follows: Establishment of the Agency : the proposal clarifies the legal framework in which the Agency operates. It states that, while considering that the responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders lies with the Member States, the Agency shall facilitate and render more effective the application of existing and future EU measures relating to the management of external borders, in particular the Schengen Borders Code, and in accordance with relevant Union law, international law, obligations related to access to international protection, and fundamental rights. It shall do so by ensuring the coordination of Member States' actions in the implementation of those measures, thereby contributing to an efficient, high and uniform level of control on persons and surveillance of the external borders of the Member States. Definitions : the proposal clarifies the definition of ""host Member State"", and introduces the concept of Frontex Joint Support Teams, and revises the definition of technical equipment. Main tasks : these include risk analysis and research. The proposal introduces the possibility for the Agency of coordinating joint return operations. The Agency also has new tasks related to the development and operation of information systems and to the provision of assistance to Eurosur. In addition, all personnel taking part in joint operations or joint return operations are required to have received appropriate training in fundamental rights. Lastly, a reporting mechanism to the Management Board regarding the operational activities of Member States with third countries is introduced. Joint operations and pilot projects at the external borders : the Agency is required to draw up an operational plan, to conduct a prior risk analysis. The Agency may also terminate joint operations and pilot projects if the conditions to conduct these initiatives are no longer fulfilled. Furthermore, it shall constitute a pool of border guards called Frontex Joint Support Teams, for possible deployment during joint operations and pilot projects. The proposal requires the Agency to evaluate the results of the joint operations and pilot projects and transmit the detailed evaluation reports within 60 days following the end of the activity to the Management Board. Lastly, it provides that the Agency may decide to finance or co-finance the joint operations and pilot projects, with grants from its budget in accordance with the financial rules applicable to the Agency."" Organisational aspects of joint operations and pilot projects : a new article sets out the obligation to draw up an operational plan for all operations. This article makes provision regarding the content of the operational plan, the respective tasks and responsibilities, the composition of the teams, command and control, the reporting mechanisms i.e. evaluation and incident reporting, the technical equipment, and the applicable jurisdiction. The Agency and the requesting Member State must agree on the operational plan and the Agency must ensure the operational implementation of all organisational aspects. Composition and deployment of Frontex Joint Support Teams (FJST): a new article sets out the obligations and conditions related to border guards to be made available to the FJST. Member States must make the border guards available for deployment. Members of the teams must perform their duties in full respect of fundamental rights and human dignity. The Agency must nominate a coordinating officer where FJST members are deployed. It will meet the costs of border guards of Member States participating in FJST Risk analysis: for the Agency’s risk analysis, Member States must provide the Agency with all necessary information regarding the situation and possible threats at the external borders. The Agency shall regularly evaluate the capacity of the Member States to face upcoming challenges, including present and future threats and pressures at the external borders of the EU. Training: Member States must integrate the common core curricula in the training of national border guards. The training must include fundamental rights aspects. Research: the proposal strengthens the role of the Agency i.e. monitoring and contributing to developments in relevant research activities Technical equipment : the new provisions clarify the Agency’s powers regarding the acquisition or lease of technical equipment and the rules of registration for heavy equipment The Agency must also keep centralised records of a Technical Equipment Pool (TEP). Member States must contribute to the TEP to allow for a minimum amount of equipment covering the needs of the Agency. The article sets out rules regarding the management by the Agency of the TEP, and rules for the reimbursement of the minimum numbers per type of equipment, and the conditions for deployment and the eligible costs Return cooperation : the proposal clarifies EU return policy, financial provisions and inserts the possibility for a Member State to request the Agency to ensure the coordination of a return operation. The Agency must adopt a Code of Conduct to be applied during joint return operations, including with regard to forced return monitoring and respect for fundamental rights. Member States must inform the Agency of their planned return operations and the degree of assistance requested from the Agency. The Agency must draw up a rolling operational plan on which the Management Board decides. The proposal clarifies the role of the Agency regarding the identification of relevant third countries Information exchange systems : the Agency is required develop and operate an information system capable of exchanging classified information. Data protection : a new Article requires the Agency to process data in accordance with Regulation 45/2001 and the Management Board to establish measures to apply the aforementioned Regulation. Security rules on the protection of classified information and non-classified sensitive information : another new article requires the Agency to apply the security principles of Decision 2001/844 for classified information, and to process non-classified sensitive information as adopted and implemented by the Commission. Facilitation of operational cooperation with third countries and cooperation with competent authorities of third countries : the proposal gives the Agency the possibility of deploying liaison officers in third countries, and the tasks of the latter are set out in the text. The Agency may benefit from Union funding in accordance with the provisions of the relevant instruments supporting the Union's external relations policy. Member States must clarify where appropriate the role of the Agency in their bilateral agreements with third countries. The deployment of liaison officers and the conclusion of working arrangements with third countries are subject to prior approval by the Commission. Headquarters Agreement : a new clause clarifies the need for a Headquarters Agreement between the Agency and the hosting Member State. In addition, the proposal makes some modifications on provisions related to staff, the powers of the Management Board on staffing policy, the composition of the Management Board and the functions and powers of the Executive Director. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal amends an existing Regulation regarding the mandate and functioning of a European Agency. The subsidy related to the Frontex Agency forms already part of the Union's budget."

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual use items requires dual-use items (including software and technology) to be subject to effective control when they are exported from or transit through the Union, or are delivered to a third country as a result of brokering services provided by a broker resident or established in the Union. In order to enable Member States and the European Union to comply with their international commitments, Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes the common list of dual use items and technology referred to in Article 3 of that Regulation, which implements internationally agreed dual-use controls. These commitments were taken within the context of participation in the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Technological progress in today's world means that there is a need to update regularly the list of controlled items. The last update of Annex I of the Regulation occurred on the occasion of the adoption of the Regulation on 5 May 2009. Since this time, all of the international export control regimes have taken decisions to modify and update their control lists. Consequently, there is a need to make modifications to Annex I. Details of the modifications to the definitions and the general note and of modifications to items in categories 1-9 are given in the proposal. For the purpose of clarity and ease of use of Annex I, the Commission is proposing to replace the entire Annex I with a new text incorporating the changes discussed.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 lays down the conditions for the further implementation of the two European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo). It provides that the system to be established under the Galileo programme will offer five services, including a ""public regulated service"" (PRS), restricted to government-authorised users, for sensitive applications which require a high level of service continuity. They specify that the PRS uses strong, encrypted signals. The PRS is a service to which the general public will not have access and which is restricted exclusively to the Council, the Commission, Member States and, where appropriate, duly authorised European Union agencies, non-member countries and international organisations. Its use must be monitored for safety and security reasons, unlike the other unsecured services which will be offered by the two European GNSS systems. It is therefore essential to monitor users by means such as establishing an authorisation procedure, using encryption keys, receiver approval, etc. Moreover, certain applications of the service may be politically and strategically very sensitive. The characteristics of the PRS as a whole necessitate a precise legislative definition of the detailed rules for access to the PRS. Furthermore, in its conclusions adopted on 12 October 2006, the Transport Council asked the Commission to actively pursue its work on the drawing up of the PRS access policy and to present its proposals in due time for the Council's deliberation and approval. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: although it has not formally been the subject of an impact assessment, the draft text is nonetheless the result of very thorough preparatory work which closely involved the various stakeholders interested in the PRS, particularly the Member States, which will be the key participants in this service. The various matters relating to the detailed rules for access to the PRS were carefully discussed by the Security Board, known as the GSB, which was established under Council Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 and repealed under Regulation (EC) No 683/2008. It should crucially be underlined that during the preparatory work carried out by the GSB, the whole range of different possible schemes was carefully considered: take no action; no monitoring of PRS users by the Member States. This option would also have been incompatible with the high level of security required for the PRS. It could not be considered in view of the sensitivity of the subject and its security implications for the Member States and the European Union; entirely centralised management at European Union level of all authorisation standards and procedures, approval and monitoring relating to the detailed rules for access to the PRS, in particular manufacture of receivers and distribution of access-protection keys; conversely, entirely decentralised management of the same components at Member State level. Under the scheme adopted, the technical functions directly connected to the infrastructure are centralised at European level through the activities of the security centre used by the European GNSS Agency; conversely, the participant supervisory functions are decentralised at national level in order to take account of local constraints. The Decision which is the subject of this proposal is likely to have an impact on the Member States, European Union bodies, international organisations and non-member countries and industrial companies. The many discussions which have taken place since 2007 within the various bodies responsible for the security of the programmes and systems have merely confirmed the consensus on the various solutions chosen in the draft. It is important to remember that, in view of their sensitive nature, matters relating to use of the PRS involve not only system security but also the security of the Member States themselves. It has for that reason proved to be politically and practically impossible for the Member States to reach a consensus on the options selected. Recourse to Joint Action 2004/552/CFSP, which falls under the unanimity rule, is furthermore explicitly provided for by the draft in any cases where the security of the European Union and its Member States could be undermined. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Although the text may have implications for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, it must nonetheless be adopted under the procedures provided for under the TFEU pursuant to the Court of Justice's case law resulting from the Judgment of 20 May 2008, C-91/05 (Commission of the European Communities v. Council of the European Union), known as ""Small arms"". CONTENT: this draft Decision lays down the detailed rules under which the Member States, the Council, the Commission, the European Union agencies and international organisations may access the public regulated service (PRS) offered by the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) established under the Galileo programme.  It contains the following key measures: general principles on the detailed rules for access to the PRS, in particular the fact that the Council, the Commission and the Member States have unlimited, uninterrupted access to the PRS anywhere in the world, while an agreement would be required to grant access to the PRS to European Union agencies, non-member countries and international organisations; the requirement for PRS participants to designate a ""Competent PRS Authority"" to manage and monitor manufacture, ownership and use of PRS receivers, and the establishment of minimum common standards to which the competent PRS authorities must comply; the establishment of a framework of conditions for the manufacture and security of PRS receivers; provisions on export control, control centres worldwide, and the implementation of joint actions under the “second pillar”. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no direct negative impact on the European Union budget; in particular, it does not commit the European Union to any new policy and the various EU supervisory bodies to which it refers have already been established by means of other texts."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). BACKGROUND : The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the Treaty (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the Treaty (implementing acts). In the case of delegated acts, the legislator delegates to the Commission the power to adopt quasi-legislative acts. In the case of implementing acts, the context is very different. Indeed, Member States are primarily responsible for the implementation of legally binding acts of the EU. However, if the application of the legislative act requires uniform conditions for its implementation the Commission is authorised to adopt these acts. Furthermore, Council Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred under Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. The alignment of Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 to the new rules of the Treaty is based on a classification on the basis of the new philosophy of the current Commission implementing powers. The classification has shown that all powers conferred to the Commission by this regulation are to adopt implementing acts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT : the main provisions of this proposal are as follows: in order to ensure the efficient implementation of voluntary modulation the Commission is empowered , by means of implementing acts, to fix the net amounts resulting from the application of voluntary modulation. Given the nature of the implementing acts envisaged, the Commission should adopt those acts without the assistance of a committee; for the same reason the Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts with the assistance of the Rural Development Committee established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to ensure the integration of voluntary modulation in the rural development programming; furthermore, the Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts with the assistance of the Committee on the Agricultural funds established by Council Regulation (EC) 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, to ensure the financial management of voluntary modulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Community is a Participant in the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits concluded in the framework of the OECD. The main objective of the Arrangement on guidelines for officially supported export credits is to regulate governments' role in export credits, so that exports reflect quality and prices rather than the most favourable officially supported terms, and hence to establish equal conditions of competition among exporters. The Arrangement has always been incorporated into Community law by way of Council Decision. The current version of the Arrangement applicable in the Community is the Decision (2001/76/EC) of 22 December 2000, which was amended by Council Decision of 22 July 2002 with respect of export credits for ships (2002/634/EC). Decision 2001/76/EC is supplemented by the Decision (2001/77/EC) of 22 December 2000 setting forth specific rules on export credits for project finance. The Arrangement has helped to prevent distortions of competition linked with officially supported export credits. It is regularly updated through negotiations via consensus within the OECD framework. The current Council decisions need to be updated to reflect the most recent version of the Arrangement, i.e. OECD document TD/PG(2005)38/FINAL of 05 December 2005. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. CONTENT: the Commission requests the Council to adopt the draft decision approving the revised Arrangement text and ensuring its application in Community law. The guidelines contained in the Arrangement annexed to this Decision shall apply in the Community. The proposal is of a very technical nature and deals only with finance/insurance rules applicable to officially supported export credits covered by OECD Arrangement. Decision 2001/76/EC and the Annex thereto are replaced by this Decision and its Annex. Decisions 2001/77/EC and 2002/634/EC are repealed. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it is important to ensure that consumers can have confidence in the integrity of electricity and gas markets and that prices set on wholesale energy markets reflect a fair interplay between supply and demand. Unless effectively addressed, the potential for unfair trading practice undermines public trust, deters investment, increases volatility of energy prices and may lead to higher energy prices in general. To date energy market monitoring practices have been Member State and sector specific. Depending on the overall market framework and regulatory situation, this can result in trading activities being subject to multiple jurisdictions with monitoring carried out by several different authorities, possibly located in different Member States. This can result in a lack of clarity as to where responsibility rests and even to a situation where no such monitoring exists. Energy markets are increasingly interlinked across the Union. Market abuse in one Member State affects wholesale prices for electricity and gas across national borders. Therefore the concern to ensure the integrity of markets cannot be a matter only for individual Member States. In December 2007, the Commission requested the advice of Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas (ERGEG) on issues relating to wholesale energy market transparency and market abuse. In their recommendation, they confirmed that the scope of existing legislation may not properly address market integrity issues on the electricity and gas markets and recommended the consideration of an appropriate legislative framework in the energy sector, preventing market abuse. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is accompanied by an Impact Assessment which examines the options for ensuring energy market integrity and transparency in detail. LEGAL BASE: Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This Article states that in the context of the establishment and functioning of the internal market Union policy on energy shall aim, inter alia, to ensure the functioning of the energy market. CONTENT: as a result the gaps identified by CESR and ERGEG, the main elements of the proposed Regulation are as follows: Clear and consistent rules : the Regulation develops rules which clearly prohibit market abuse on wholesale markets in electricity and related products, and wholesale markets in natural gas and related products. These rules include clear prohibitions on trading on insider information, and market manipulation. These rules are formulated in such a way that they are consistent with the Market Abuse Directive, and do not apply to financial instruments which are already covered by that Directive. Adaptable and compatible rules : the Regulation allows these rules to be specified in delegated acts of the Commission. Industry responses to the public consultation favoured this approach, which allows the specificities of energy markets, which are subject to change, to be taken into account. Measures for effective detection and deterrence : - Market monitoring : to detect market abuse an effectively functioning market monitor with timely access to complete transactional data is necessary. EU level market monitoring can take the holistic view needed for the monitoring of energy markets. The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators has the necessary expertise in energy markets, and institutional connections with national energy regulators for this role. The Regulation provides for the Agency to gather, review and share data from wholesale energy markets. Member State authorities, including national regulatory authorities, financial regulators and competition authorities, have a direct interest in the market results and bring a vital understanding of the markets in their jurisdiction. Therefore cooperation between the Agency and national authorities is central to the monitoring foreseen. - Data Reporting : the Regulation requires market participants to provide the Agency with a record of their transactions in wholesale energy products. The form, content and timing of the information to be provided will be laid down in delegated acts of the Commission. These will be based on draft guidelines developed by the Agency. These guidelines will provide for several channels for the reporting of data. This will minimise the burden on market participants and avoid double reporting obligations on entities covered by the Market Abuse Directive. - Investigation and Enforcement : market monitoring will be accompanied by effective investigation where market abuse is suspected, where necessary leading to appropriate sanctions. The Regulation gives national regulatory authorities the lead role in this, requiring Member States to grant them the necessary powers to investigate suspected market abuse and to lay down appropriate rules on the penalties applicable in case of violations of the Regulation. The Regulation also recognises that the cross border nature of energy markets means that cooperation will be crucial. In this ACER is given an important role. In close contact with energy regulators and financial supervisors it will ensure that a consistent approach is taken to suspected market abuse, alerting national regulatory authorities to potential market abuse and facilitating information exchange. This coordination role will be particularly important when an investigation covers several Member States or it is unclear where the suspected market abuse actually occurred. The Regulation provides for the possibility for an investigatory group to be established, coordinated by the Agency but made up of representatives of concerned national regulatory authorities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total appropriations to cover the new tasks of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators is estimated at EUR 1.315 million in 2012 and EUR 1.613 in 2013. These amounts cover the equipment, operating costs, mission expenditure for the new task and human resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: based on a mandate from the Council, the European Commission has negotiated with the Republic of Cape Verde to renew the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Cape Verde, dated 19 December 2006. Following these negotiations, a new protocol was initialled on 22 December 2010, covering a period of three years starting from 1 September 2011, since the protocol currently in force will expire on 31 August 2011 (see CNS/2006/0122). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. The Commission’s negotiating position was based in part on the results of an ex-post evaluation carried out by external experts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal for a Decision relates to the conclusion of a new Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Cape Verde. The objective is to continue the cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde to create a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and to ensure the sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Cape Verde fishing zone, which is in the interests of both Parties. Financial contribution : t he overall annual contribution of the Protocol of EUR 1 305 000 over the whole period is based on: a) an annual reference tonnage fixed at 5 000 tonnes for 74 vessels, corresponding to EUR 325 000 per year, and b) support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of Cape Verde amounting to EUR 110 000 per year. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy. The reference tonnage has been kept unchanged at 5 000 tonnes/year. Nevertheless, taking account of needs in the fisheries sector in Cape Verde, the budget allocated to sectoral support has increased in comparison with the previous Protocol. The annual financial contribution has increased by EUR 50 000 (+ 13%) in comparison with the previous Protocol (2006-11). Fishing authorisation : the new Agreement grants fishing authorisations to the tuna category alone. Fishing opportunities : 28 tuna seiners, 35 surface longliners and 11 pole-and-line vessels will be authorised to fish. Advances and fees payable by shipowners : EUR 35 per tonne of tuna caught in the Cape Verde fishing area by seiners and surface longliners and EUR 25 per tonne for pole-andline vessels. The annual advances are set at EUR 4 375 per tuna seiner, EUR 3 150 per longliner and EUR 450 per pole-and-line vessel. Period of application : for a period of three years from 1 September 2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the overall annual contribution of the Protocol of EUR 1 305 000 from 2011 to 2013, that is EUR 435 000/year (administrative expenditure excluded). The financial envelope of EUR 264 600 is provided for administrative expenditure. It should be noted that the advances and fees have no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the introduction of the euro has considerably increased the need for cross-border transportation of cash by road. However, due to incompatibilities between national legislations it is in most cases very difficult for professional cash transporters to move euro cash between euro-area Member States and very little cross-border land transportation therefore takes place. Regulatory differences concern a wide range of issues such as the possession and carrying of firearms by the cash-in-transit (CIT) staff, authorised transport modalities, armouring and equipment of the CIT-vehicles, number of staff in the vehicles etc. The current regulatory obstacles moreover imply a fragmentation of the single market in this sector. The European Central Bank, the banking sector and the large retail sector have repeatedly called for the launch of an initiative aimed at lifting the obstacles to the professional cross border transportation by road of euro cash in Europe. On this basis, the Commission adopted a White Paper on professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between Member States in the euro area in May 2009. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five broad options were considered: Option 1 : a baseline no-change scenario; Option 2 : bilateral/multilateral agreements between those Member States potentially most concerned by cross-border transports; Option 3 : a set of common rules for cross-border transports only; Option 4 : full mutual recognition; and Option 5 : full harmonisation of the regulation of all CIT-transport. The detailed analysis of impacts concerns option 3: a set of common rules for cross-border transport. This option would meet the objective of facilitating the free circulation of euro cash. Since it is limited to cross-border transports it would furthermore not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives. Three sub-options are moreover considered: (i) extending the scope of the rules to EU Member States outside the current euro area; (ii) extending the scope to other cash and valuables; and (iii) restricting the scope to point-to-point transports only. As regards the sub-options, it is concluded that the common rules should apply also to the territory of EU Member States that are about to introduce the euro as from the date of the decision of the Council to abrogate their derogation from participating in the euro. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Action at EU level brings important economies of scale as compared to bilateral or multilateral action. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down a set of common rules for the professional cross-border transport of euro cash within the euro area. It is based on the principle of a specific cross-border CIT-licence which would be granted by the Member State of origin to CIT-companies whishing to transport euro cash across borders. Seven different authorised transport types are foreseen – five for the transport of banknotes and two for the transport of coins – with possibilities for Member Sates to opt out from specific options for their territory. In terms of scope, the following elements are noteworthy: the proposed Regulation would apply to the professional transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States. It is also foreseen that the territory of Member States which have not yet introduced the euro are covered by the Regulation as from the date of the Council decision to abrogate their derogation from participating in the euro. The extension of the scope of the Regulation is the subject of a separate proposed Regulation; the proposed Regulation would apply both to so-called point-to-point transports (i.e. transports from one secure location to another secure location with no intermediate stops) and so-called retail transports of cash (multi-stops transports servicing final customers); for retail transports, the majority of the stops must take place in the host Member State(s), whereas there is no limit to the number of stops that can be made in either the Member State of origin or the host Member State; the transports must as a rule be carried out during daytime, with exceptions foreseen for point-to point transports; the CIT-vehicle must return to its Member State of origin within the same day. The CIT cross-border licence : C IT-companies whishing to undertake cross-border transport of cash under the terms of the Regulation must apply for a specific licence from the granting authority of their Member State of origin. To obtain the licence, the company, its management and its staff will have to meet a certain number of conditions laid down in the Regulation. In case of infringement of the rules, the sanctioning power belongs to the authority that granted the licence, i.e. the authority of the Member State of origin. However, safeguarding powers are granted to the Member State crossed or the host Member State in case of emergency or manifest breaches of the rules (e.g. minimum number of staff not respected, infringement of the rules on the carrying of weapons etc). Member States furthermore have a duty of mutual information on all these aspects. Authorised transport types F or banknotes , the following five transport types would be authorised for the cross-border transport of cash: transportation of banknotes in an unarmoured vehicle of ordinary appearance equipped with a system of neutralisation of banknotes (IBNS); transportation of banknotes in an unarmoured vehicle with a clear marking indicating that it is equipped with IBNS; transportation of banknotes in a cabin-armoured vehicle equipped with IBNS; transportation of banknotes in a fully-armoured vehicle not equipped with IBNS; transportation of banknotes in a fully-armoured vehicle equipped with IBNS. For coins , the following two transport types are foreseen: transportation of coins in an unarmoured vehicle; transportation of coins in a cabin-armoured vehicle. In all cases, there must be at least two security staff in the vehicle, except for transport in a fully-armoured vehicle without IBNS where three security staff are required. Member States may choose to close down the use of certain options for their territory as long as they accept at least one of the above-listed options for banknotes and one of the above-listed options for coins and as long as they do not allow comparable transport modalities for domestic CIT-transports. Application of national rules : in particularly sensitive areas from the point of view of security, national rules would continue to apply. These areas concern the carrying and use of weapons, the relationship with the police forces and the rules governing the behaviour of the CIT security staff outside the CIT-vehicle as well as the security of the locations where the cash is delivered or picked up. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no negative impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology requires dual-use items (including software and technology) to be subject to effective control when they are exported from the Community. Dual-use items (including software and technology) are civil items which can be used for military purposes. They are subject to control when they are to be exported from the European Union. These controls are designed in particular to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that such control is fully effective and complies with Member States' commitments at multilateral level, authorisation is required under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 for export of the dual-use items listed in Annex I. There are four types of export authorisations: 1) Community General Export Authorisation (CGEA) No EU001, as referred to in Article 6 of Regulation 1334/2000, covers most of the exports of controlled items to seven countries (United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway); 2) for all other exports for which an authorisation is required under the Regulation, it leaves to the national authorities the final decision as to whether to grant a national general, global or individual export licence. National general export authorisations are created by individual EU Member States and are valid in principle across the EU. However, in spite of the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000, there is a lack of transparency across Member States regarding both the scope and conditions of use of national general export authorisations and the list of exporters denied access to national general export authorisations. As a result, the chances of infringement of the Regulation are significant. This leads to regulatory treatment of certain exports that benefits businesses established in one Member State at least partly at the expense of businesses established in and national security interests of other Member States, and is not in the best interests of the Community as a whole. In its Communication of 18 December 2006, the Commission put forward the idea of the creation of new Community General Export Authorisations in a bid to simplify the current legal system, enhance the industry’s competitiveness and establish a level playing field for all Community exporters when they export certain items to certain destinations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this initiative does not create new administrative burdens for companies. The objective is to provide exporters with a more comprehensive instrument than national authorisations — valid throughout the European Union. Even if it impossible to measure the exact impact, it is clear that the initiative will have a positive operational impact on exporters, that there will be no negative impact at EU level and that this narrow legislative initiative would have no far-reaching economic, social or environmental impact beyond the dual-use goods regime. LEGAL BASIS: please refer to the summary entitled “background note”. CONTENT: in order to create new Community General Export Authorisations for certain non-sensitive dual-use items to certain non-sensitive countries, the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 need to be amended by the addition of six new Annexes. The draft proposal covers six new CGEAs. Compared to the preferences expressed by the Working Party sub-group on new CGEAs, this proposal has added a number of countries and items and made a number of changes to the conditions of use of the authorisations. In addition, the draft Regulation states that the competent authorities of the Member State where the exporter is established should be provided with the possibility of not permitting the use of the Community General Export Authorisations foreseen in this Regulation where the exporter has been sanctioned of an export-related offence punishable by the withdrawal of the right to use these authorisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the global economic and financial crisis revealed gaps and weaknesses in the existing instruments and methods of co-ordination and surveillance of economic policies in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). There is broad agreement that the framework for EMU should be urgently strengthened in order to anchor macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances. The key instrument for fiscal policy co-ordination and surveillance is the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which implements the Treaty provisions on budgetary discipline. Strengthening the Pact is important for both increasing the credibility of the agreed co-ordinated fiscal exit strategy and avoiding a repetition of past mistakes. This proposal is part of legislative package comprising six texts which seeks to strengthen the pact by improving its provisions in the light of experience, not least of the crisis: 1) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1466/97); 2) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1467/97); 3) A Regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area; 4) A new Council Directive on requirements for the budgetary framework of the Member States; 5) A new Regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; 6) A Regulation on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. The outlines of these proposals were announced by the Commission in two communications on economic governance: “Reinforcing economic policy coordination” (12 May 2010) and “Enhancing economic policy coordination for stability, growth and jobs – Tools for stronger EU economic governance” (30 June 2010). In June 2010, the European Council agreed on the urgent need to reinforce the coordination of economic policies. strengthening both the preventive and corrective parts of the SGP, including with sanctions and taking due account of the particular situation of euro-area Member States; giving, in budgetary surveillance, a much more prominent role to levels and evolutions of debt and overall sustainability; ensuring that all Member States have national budgetary rules and medium term budgetary frameworks in line with the SGP; ensuring the quality of statistical data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the preventive part of the SGP is meant to ensure that Member States follow prudent fiscal policies so that there is no need to adopt more stringent forms of coordination to avoid public finance sustainability being put at risk, with potential negative consequences for EMU as a whole. Accordingly, Member States are required to present stability and convergence programmes outlining their plans to achieve medium-term budgetary objectives (MTOs), which are defined as a percentage of GDP in structural terms (i.e. adjusting for the effect of the cycle and excluding one-off and temporary measures) and are differentiated across countries around a close-to-balance position to reflect the level of public debt and liabilities related to ageing. Member States not having reached their MTO are expected to converge towards it at an annual pace of 0.5% of GDP in structural terms. However, progress towards MTOs in the medium term has been generally insufficient. In a number of countries, even apparently sound budgetary positions before the crisis masked a strong reliance on windfall revenues to finance expenditure, the reversal of which contributed to soaring budget deficits. To respond to these shortcomings the reform of the preventive part that is being proposed, while retaining the current MTOs and the 0.5% of GDP annual convergence requirement, makes them operational in terms of a new principle of prudent fiscal policy-making. This new principle will provide the benchmark against which countries’ fiscal plans in the stability and convergence programme will be examined. A prudent fiscal policy implies that the rate of growth of public expenditure does not exceed, in principle, a prudent medium-term rate of growth of GDP, unless the MTO has been significantly overachieved or the excess of expenditure growth over the prudent medium-term rate is matched by discretionary measures on the revenue side. Failure to keep to the agreed rate of growth of expenditure, in conjunction with the stipulated revenue measures, will make the Member State concerned liable to a warning from the Commission and, if persistent and/or particularly serious, a Council recommendation to take corrective action. A temporary departure from prudent fiscal policy-making should be allowed in case of severe economic downturn of a general nature in order to facilitate economic recovery. Special attention shall be paid to pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully funded pillar. Member States implementing such reforms shall be allowed to deviate from the adjustment path to their medium-term budgetary objective or from the objective itself, with the deviation reflecting the net cost of the reform to the publicly managed pillar, under the condition that the deviation remains temporary and that an appropriate safety margin with respect to the deficit reference value is preserved. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal relates to the extension of an existing action and does not require any additional human or financial resources."

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the changes that the Commission is proposing in regard to the preventive and corrective parts of the SGP need to be complemented by a new set of graduated financial sanctions for euro-area Member States to make the enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area more effective. 1) As regards the preventive part, the implementation mechanism would take the form of an interest-bearing deposit, amounting to 0.2% of GDP. A procedure of ‘reverse voting’ mechanism is introduced for imposing the interest-bearing deposit: on the issue of a recommendation, the deposit would become due on proposal by the Commission, unless the Council decides to the contrary by qualified majority within ten days. The Council could reduce the amount of the deposit only unanimously or based on a Commission proposal and a reasoned request from the Member State concerned. The deposit will be returned with the accrued interest once the Council is satisfied that the situation giving rise to it has come to an end. 2) As far as the corrective part is concerned, a non-interest-bearing deposit amounting to 0.2% of GDP would apply upon a decision to place a country in excessive deficit. This would be converted into a fine in the event of non-compliance with the initial recommendation to correct the deficit. Further non-compliance would result in the sanction being stepped up, in line with the already existing provisions in the SGP. To reduce discretion in enforcement, the ‘reverse voting’ mechanism is envisaged for imposing the new sanctions in connection with the successive steps of the EDP. Specifically, at each step of the EDP, the Commission will make a proposal for the relevant sanction, and this will be considered adopted, unless the Council decides to the contrary by qualified majority within ten days. The size of the non-interest-bearing deposit or the fine could only be reduced or cancelled by the Council unanimously or based on a specific proposal from the Commission on grounds of exceptional economic circumstances or following a reasoned request by the Member State concerned. The non-interest-bearing deposit should be released upon correction of the excessive deficit while the interest on such deposits and the fines collected should be distributed among Member States whose currency is the euro which do not have an excessive deficit and which are not the subject of an excessive imbalance procedure either.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the years preceding the crisis, low financing costs fuelled misallocation of resources, often to less productive uses, feeding unsustainable levels of consumption, housing bubbles and accumulation of external and internal debt in some Member States. The emergence of large macroeconomic imbalances, including wide and persistent divergences in competitiveness trends, proved highly damaging to the European Union, and in particular to the euro, when the crisis struck. It is therefore important to develop a new structured procedure for prevention and correction of adverse macroeconomic imbalances in every Member State. In its Communication and report on « EMU@10: successes and challenges after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union ” the Commission stressed, in particular, the need to broaden economic surveillance in order to detect and address macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage. The Europe 2020 strategy calls for the development of a specific policy framework for the euro area to tackle broader macroeconomic imbalances. Overall, the Task Force on economic governance, chaired by the President of the European Council, agreed that macroeconomic surveillance should function alongside the budget surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact. This proposal is part of legislative package comprising six texts which seeks to strengthen the pact by improving its provisions in the light of experience, not least of the crisis: 1) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1466/97); 2) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1467/97); 3) A Regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area; 4) A new Council Directive on requirements for the budgetary framework of the Member States; 5) A new Regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; 6) A Regulation on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area.

CONTENT: the Commission is proposing a mechanism for the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances which is made up of two draft proposals for regulations. The first proposal sketches out the excessive imbalance procedure (EIP), while this proposal focuses on the associated enforcement measures. The second proposal specifies that if a Member State repeatedly fails to act on Council recommendations to address excessive macroeconomic imbalances, it will have to pay a yearly fine equal to 0.1% of its GDP. As a rule, the Commission will propose the maximum amount of the fine provided for and this proposal will be considered adopted, unless the Council decides to the contrary by qualified majority within ten days of the Commission adopting its proposal (“reverse voting”). The Council may amend the Commission proposal by acting unanimously. The Council may decide, on the basis of a Commission proposal, to cancel or to reduce the fine. The Commission could make a proposal to this end following assessment of a reasoned request by the Member State and this would reverse the burden of proof for application of the sanction. Furthermore, the Commission could also make a proposal to the same end on the basis of exceptional economic circumstances. Council decisions concerning such fines will be made only by the members representing Member States whose currency is the euro. The vote of the member of the Council representing the Member State concerned by the decisions will not be taken into account. The fines provided for in this proposal for a regulation constitute other revenue, as referred to in Article 311 of the Treaty. In line with the practice established in the corrective part of the SGP (Regulation 'EC) No 1467/97), this revenue will be distributed between Member States whose currency is the euro and which are not involved in an excessive imbalance procedure and not involved in an excessive deficit procedure, in proportion to their share of the total GNI of the eligible Member States.

It comprises a regular assessment of risks of imbalances, including an alert mechanism, coupled with rules designed to allow corrective action in case of adverse macroeconomic imbalances extending beyond fiscal policy. The EIP applies to every Member State. The proposal provides for a regular assessment of risks of imbalances, based on a scoreboard using economic indicators. The Commission may launch in-depth reviews for Member States at risk that will identify the underlying problems. For Member States with severe imbalances or imbalances that put at risk the functioning of EMU, the Council may adopt recommendations and open an ""excessive imbalance procedure (EIP)"". Following the opening of an EIP, the Member State concerned will be under an obligation to adopt a corrective action plan within a specific timeframe, to set out a roadmap of implementing policy measures. Within two months after submission of a corrective action plan and on the basis of a Commission report, the Council shall assess the corrective action plan. If considered sufficient, on the basis of a Commission proposal, the Council shall adopt an opinion, endorsing it. If the actions taken or envisaged in the corrective action plan or their timetable for implementation are considered insufficient to implement the recommendations, the Council shall, on the basis of a Commission proposal, invite the Member State to amend its corrective action plan within a new deadline. The Member State concerned will be required to provide regular reports and will be monitored until the closure of the EIP. If the Member State has not taken the appropriate action, the EIP will be continued. The Council will have to adopt revised recommendations along with a new deadline by which to complete its corrective action.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 by Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 with the main objective of showing solidarity with and providing support to workers affected by redundancies resulting from changes in world trade patterns. In the light of the scale and the speed of development of the financial and economic crisis in 2008, the Commission, in its European Economic Recovery Plan, envisaged the revision of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. The aim of this revision, brought about by Regulation (EC) No 546/2009, was to extend the scope of the EGF as part of Europe's crisis response and to turn it into an early, more effective crisis intervention instrument in line with the fundamental principles of solidarity and social justice. The amendments included permanent changes, such as the reduction from 1 000 to 500 of the required number of redundancies to trigger an application for EGF support and an extension from 12 to 24 months of the implementation period for EGF supported measures. A temporary derogation was introduced in order (1) to enlarge the scope of the EGF to cover support in favour of workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the financial and economic crisis (paragraph 1a of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006) and (2) to increase the level of EGF co-funding from 50 to 65% (Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006). The temporary derogation expires on 30 December 2011 and the possibility of reviewing it is provided for in the second paragraph of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. Therefore, it is proposed to extend the temporary crisis-related derogation, which expires on 30 December 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 175(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to extend the temporary derogation to support workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis the date laid down in the second paragraph of paragraph 1a of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 is replaced by 31 December 2013. This amendment also automatically extends the increased co-financing rate of 65% until the same date, as laid down in Article 10(1) of the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: Article 28 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006on budgetary discipline and sound financial management provides that the EGF may not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 500 million. Based on the requests for EGF support in the past the proposed extension of the crisis related derogation in Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 is not expected to exceed this maximum annual amount. These requests reached EUR 51.8 million in 2007 and EUR 20.6 million in 2008. In 2009 the total amount of EGF support requested reached EUR 131.7 million, of which 75% concerned crisis related applications and 25% trade related applications. In 2010 the total amount of EGF support requested reached EUR 132,5 million, of which 87% related to crisis related applications and 13% to trade related applications."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was established in 1990 to support the development of market economies from central Europe to central Asia following the widespread collapse of communist regimes. The European Union, together with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and 40 countries (including all EU Member states at that time), were founding members. The EBRD is currently owned by 61 countries, the EU and the EIB. The initial capital of the EBRD was fixed at ECU 10 billion, of which the EU subscribed 3%. In 1996, the Governors of the EBRD decided to double the authorised capital of the EBRD for which the EU subscribed an additional 30 000 shares of EUR 10 000 each, bringing the EU subscribed capital at EUR 600 million. The EU share in the EBRD total authorised capital was maintained unchanged. At the Annual Meeting of the Governors of the EBRD on 14/15 May 2010, the Board of Governors adopted Resolutions 126 and 128 providing for an increase in the authorised capital stock of the Bank of 50% from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion. The capital increase comprises EUR 1 billion paid-in capital and EUR 9 billion of new callable capital. For the EU, it means that the EU shall subscribe up to an additional 27 013 callable shares (each worth EUR 10 000 each) amounting to EUR 270.13 million taking into account the EU proportion of 3.031% in the subscribed capital. The subscription of callable shares amounting to a total of EUR 9 billion will become effective as soon as the individual shareholders have completed their internal procedures and deposited their instruments of subscription, as it was the case for the 1996 capital increase. The Bank would expect that the callable capital increase will become effective at the end of April 2011, but in any event not later than 31 December 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the EBRD fourth Capital Resources Review (CRR4) for the period 2011-2015, which was undertaken during the past year, reflected the need for the Bank to respond effectively to the crisis and to redirect its medium term strategy taking account of the significant impact the crisis is having on its region of operations. In this framework, the EBRD carried out an analysis of capital enhancement options, based on the need to comply with the Bank’s statutory ‘gearing ratio’ and economic capital requirements, the maintenance of the Bank’s Triple-A credit rating, as well as the effective and efficient use of shareholders' capital. The efforts undertaken by the EBRD to mitigate the impact of the crisis in all its countries of operations through the proposed capital increase will allow the Bank to sustain a high level of activity and accompany the recovery in its region of operations, in cooperation with the EIB and other International Financial Institutions. It is expected that the capital increase would enable the EBRD to have an annual business volume of about EUR 9 billion for 2011 and 2012, and about EUR 8.5 billion until 2015. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under the terms and conditions of Resolution 128 on capital increase in the form of additional subscription of callable capital, the authorised capital stock of the Bank shall be increased by 900 000 callable shares, each share having a par value of EUR 10 000 which shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of the above Resolution. The EU is entitled to subscribe up to 27 013 callable shares. The proposed Decision aims at authorising the EU to take part in the callable part of the EBRD capital increase by subscribing to the shares it is allowed to. According to the terms of the Resolution 128, each member of the EBRD shall deposit with the Bank an instrument of subscription whereby the member subscribes to the number of callable shares specified in such instrument. In addition, the member shall deposit a representation that the member has duly taken all legal and other internal action necessary to enable it to make such subscription. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: as regards the callable part of the capital increase, its budgetary impact will be catered for by the budget line 01 03 01 02 ""European Bank for Reconstruction and Development – Callable portion of subscribed capital"", which has been established in the 2011 budget, so as to reflect the EU budget's liability deriving from the callable part of the EU participation in the EBRD's capital. The budget line should be endowed with a 'p.m.' reflecting the contingent nature of the call and a budgetary comment defining the size of the contingent liability. Although a call is considered to be highly unlikely, the budgetary line and its comment will reflect the financing needs which could arise in the event of a payment request by the EBRD relating to the callable part of the capital subscribed by the EU. The modalities of the EU participation in the capital increase of the EBRD do not foresee any operational expenditure. The amount for human resources amounts to EUR 135 million for 2010 to 2013."

BACKGROUND: In accordance with Council Decision 2001/748/EC concerning the signing on behalf of the European Community12 of the United Nations Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against transnational Organised Crime, the Commission signed that Protocol on behalf of the Community on 16 January 2002. The UN Firearms Protocol - the purpose of which is promote, facilitate and strengthen cooperation among States Parties in order to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition - entered into force on 3 July 2005. This proposal aims to complete the process of transposition into Union legislation of the provisions of the Protocol. It is also included in the broader framework of the Stockholm Programme for ‘an open and secure Europe, serving and protecting citizens’ highlights trafficking in arms as one of the illegal activities that continue to challenge the internal security of the EU and reaffirms that the Union should continue to promote ratification of international Conventions (and their Protocols), in particular those developed under the auspices of the United Nations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal developed four policy options: Policy option 1 : refrain from taking EU action. This was identified as a theoretical option due both to the legal international obligation entered into by the Community (now Union) by means of signature of the Protocol and to the lack of uniform principles in a matter falling under the common commercial policy, an exclusive competence of the Union; Policy option 2 : this option aimed at optimal achievement of the objective of contributing to the improvement of security with regard to export, import and transit of firearms for civilian use and prevention of possible diversion from the legal market; Policy option 3 : this option aimed to achieve efficient implementation of Article 10 of the UNFP for private parties; Policy option 4 : this option focused on efficiency for national administrations. Option 3 was the preferred one and is reflected in this proposal . It fulfils the objectives of implementing Article 10 UNFP in the most comprehensive manner and is the best way forward by combining the ‘shall’ (i.e. mandatory) provisions — adapted to the type of products (for civilian use) — with the ‘may’ (i.e. optional) ones, which would match stakeholders’ legitimate expectations. It combines different aspects of the various policy options on the basis of the main advantages and disadvantages identified for each one of them, in order to achieve a higher degree of both effectiveness and efficiency. The envisaged simplified procedure for temporary exports for ‘verifiable lawful purposes’ and in particular the proposed transit measures will reduce the possible administrative burdens for those lawful purposes listed by the UNFP itself. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (Common Commercial Policy which is an exclusive competence of the Union according to Article 3 TFEU, within which Article 10 UNFP provisions fall). The proposal applies only to firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition for civilian use and not to firearms that are intended specifically for military purposes. Pursuant to Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the common commercial policy should be based on uniform principles, inter alia as regards exports. CONTENT: Article 10 of the UNFP on ‘general requirements for export, import and transit licensing or authorisation systems’ requires ‘each State Party to establish or maintain an effective system of export and import licensing or authorisation, as well as of measures on international transit, for the transfer of firearms, their parts and components and ammunition’, thereby improving scrutiny of transfers and allowing better enforcement of laws. Principles : Article 10 UNFP is based on the principle that firearms and related items should not be transferred between States without the awareness and consent of all States involved. Firearms should not be exported to or through countries that have not authorised the transfer. The content of the documents used for legal export and import should be sufficient to ensure tracing. Besides the above-mentioned ‘Shall’ provisions, Article 10 UNFP also allows the Parties to adopt simplified procedures for temporary export, import and transit of small numbers of firearms for ‘verifiable lawful purposes’, such as recreational, repair, exhibition. The latter are referred to as ‘May’ provisions. In application of Article 10 of the Protocol, the proposal is structured as follows : Subject, definition and scope : this proposal only addresses trade in/transfers of firearms to third countries and consequently does not concern intra-Community transfers of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition. Definitions (Article 2) take into account — where appropriate — the parallel provisions of the UN Firearms Protocol, but are tailored to or directly invoke other existing EU legislation, for the sake of clarity: for example, the definitions of firearms, parts and essential components and ammunition mirror those of Directive 91/477 or direct reference is made to the Community Customs Code. Article 3 lists the specific exceptions to which the Regulation does not apply. Export authorisation, procedures and controls : the relevant articles transpose the concepts mandatorily established by Article 10 UNFP. Article 4 establishes the general obligation for requiring export authorisation, refers to the list of products to which the proposal applies (in Annex to the proposal) and provides for updates. Articles 5 and 6 on the conditions for issuing the export authorisation also include some of the mitigation measures resulting from the advice received from stakeholders during the consultation, for example: maximum processing period (90 working days), possible use of electronic documents and tacit consent for transit. Articles 11 and 12 address respectively the correspondent provisions of Article 10(4) and (5) UNFP on verification of the authorisation procedure. Simplified procedures : this proposal in particular takes into account the need for simplified measures for temporary exports for verifiable lawful purposes, implementing the nonbinding provision of Article 10(6) UNFP. Simplified procedures should be limited to hunters and sport shooters only (while the UNFP includes consideration also for other activities such as exhibitions or repairs). Criteria applicable to export authorisation, procedures and controls : this chapter also includes provisions on general criteria to be taken into account by Member States when assessing a request for export authorisation (Articles 8 and 9) and on powers of national competent authorities (Article 13), which are similar to those laid down in other commercial policy legislation, namely the ‘Dual Use’ Regulation10. Article 10 focuses on the need for record-keeping. Article 14 reproduces a standard formula on penalties. Customs procedures and administrative cooperation : Chapter III, on ‘customs procedures’ (Articles 15 and 16), and Chapter IV on ‘administrative cooperation’ (Article 17), include standard provisions commonly used in a commercial policy instrument. General and final provisions : besides the establishment of a Coordination Group (Article 18), it includes in particular a review clause (Article 19(3)), and provisions on the entry into force of the Regulation (Article 20). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, the European Union has granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process. Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 was codified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 of 30 November 2009. Two Stabilisation and Association Agreements, the first between the EC and their Member States of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and the second between the EC and its Member States of the one part, and Serbia of the other part, was signed respectively in Luxemburg on 16 June 2008 and on 29 April 2008. Pending the completion of the procedures necessary for its entry into force, two Interim Agreements on trade and trade-related matters were signed and concluded. These Agreements entered into force on 1 July 2008 (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and on 1 February 2010 (Serbia). The Stabilisation and Association Agreements and the Interim Agreements establish a contractual trade regime between the European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and between the European Union and Serbia. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 by removing Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia from the list of beneficiaries of the tariff concessions granted for the same products under the contractual regime and to adjust the global tariff quota volumes for specific products for which tariff quotas have been granted under the contractual regimes. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia should however remain beneficiaries of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 insofar as that Regulation provides for concessions which are more favourable than the concessions existing under the contractual regime. Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 expires on 31 December 2010. It remains the main instrument governing trade relations with Kosovo. The General Affairs Council in its Conclusions of 8 December 2009 states that in respect to the EU's relations with Kosovo it attaches importance to measures on trade, without prejudice to Member States' positions on status. Continued access to the market of the European Union is crucial for the economic recovery of Kosovo and the whole region. At the same time, it will not create negative effects for the European Union. The European Parliament in its Resolution on 26 November 2009 Enlargement strategy 2009 concerning the countries of the Western Balkans Iceland and Turkey calls on the Commission to make every possible effort to mitigate the effect of the economic crisis on the Western Balkans. For these reasons it is appropriate to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 to 31 December 2015. CONTENT: this proposal amends certain elements of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments consequent to the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In order to ensure the respect of the Union's international obligations, the preferences contained in this Regulation should be made conditional on continuation or renewal of the existing waiver from WTO obligations obtained by the European Union. To protect the economic interest of operators, it is necessary to provide for transitional measures for goods that are, at the date of entry into force of this Regulation in transit or in temporary storage in customs warehouses. Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 also contains certain powers reserved to the Council and which are not based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (comitology). The Commission will make a proposal which will revise all such procedures in the common commercial policy in the light of the system of implementing acts set out in Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the regulation on the rules and general principles concerning the Commission's exercise of the implementing powers adopted on the basis of Article 291(3). That proposal will also address Articles 2 and 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009. This proposal will be presented as soon as possible after the Commission has adopted a proposal on the rules and general principles concerning the Commission's exercise of the implementing powers. In order not to disrupt trade, it is necessary for this Regulation to be applied as of 1 January 2011 given that Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2009 expires on 31 December 2010. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EC budget. Its application would also not entail any losses of customs revenue compared to the current situation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/25/EC regulates exhaust emissions from engines installed in agricultural or forestry tractors. The stage of emission limits currently applicable for type approval of the majority of compression ignition engines is referred to as Stage IIIA. The Directive provides that those limits will be replaced by the more stringent Stage IIIB limits, entering into force progressively as of 1st January 2010 as regards the type approval and as of 1st January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market of those engines. Directive 2004/26/EC amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery, provides that the Commission shall consider the available technology, including the cost-benefit, with a view to confirming stage IIIB and IV limit values and evaluating the possible need for additional flexibilities, exemptions or later introduction dates for certain types of equipment or engines and taking into account engines installed in non-road mobile machinery used in seasonal applications. Directive 2000/25/EC provides for a review clause in order to take into account the specificities of tractors of categories T2, T4.1 and C.2 (called narrow-track tractors, maximum width less than 1.15 m). Directive 97/68/EC was the subject of several technical studies. As a result of these technical studies carried out in 2007, 2009 and 2010, it was established that it is not technically feasible for tractors classified within the categories T2, C2 and T4.1 to meet the requirements of stages IIIB and IV already at the dates in the Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook a formal impact assessment in 2010, based on the previously mentioned technical studies and taking into account recent technological developments. The conclusion was that technical solutions are likely to be feasible, although not in the timeframe set in current legislation. A delay of 3 years for Stage IIIB and Stage IV requirements was assessed as the preferred option. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to prevent Union legislation from prescribing technical requirements which cannot be met yet and in order to prevent that tractors of categories T2, C2 and T4.1. can no longer be type-approved and placed on the market or put into service, the Commission proposes that the dates given in Article 4 of Directive 2000/25/EC for type approval and initial entry into service of Stages IIIB and IV shall be delayed by three years for tractors of categories T2, C2 and T4.1. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it is recalled that Directive 97/68/EC regulates the maximum exhaust emissions carbon oxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates (PM) from diesel engines installed in construction, agricultural and forestry machinery, railcars & locomotives, inland waterway vessels, constant speed engines and small petrol engines used in different types of machinery. The Directive provides for emissions limit stages of increasing stringency with corresponding compliance dates. Manufacturers must ensure that new engines comply with these limits in order that they can be placed on the market. Directive 2004/26/EC introduced the current applicable stage of emission limits for the majority of diesel engines referred to as Stage III A. These limits will be replaced by the more stringent Stage III B limits progressively as of 1st January 2011. The type approval period for these engines started on 1 January 2010. A great diversity of machinery production (approximately 1500 companies in the EU) is affected. To comply with Stage III B limits, current engines will need to be substantially modified. Changes to the configuration, size or weight of engines have a knock-on effect for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) who will have to adapt the design of their machines in order to accommodate the modified engines. This process can only start once the engine is fully developed. Technical solutions for complying III B engines are not yet finalised. Thus, OEMs are not in a position to fully redesign the machinery where the engine is to be installed. In addition, compliance costs for manufacturers to cope with the new emission limits are significant. Directive 2004/26/EC also introduced the flexibility scheme to facilitate the transition between the different emission stages. The flexibility scheme allows the OEM to place on the market, during the period between two successive stages of exhaust emissions limit values, a limited number of non-road mobile machines which are fitted with engines that still comply with the exhaust emission limits of the previous stage. The flexibility scheme applies to compression ignition (diesel) engines used in construction, agricultural and forestry machinery, generator sets and pumps using constant speed engines, but not to locomotives, railcars and inland waterway vessels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a detailed Impact Assessment has been carried out on the basis of technical studies and a stakeholder consultation. It covers the different scenarios for engines covered by the existing flexibility scheme and identifies the need to include railcars. In addition to the conclusions of the Impact Assessment, locomotives have been added to the flexibility scheme. The Impact Assessment analyses different options ranging from the implementation of a scrapping scheme, variations of the flexibility scheme as regards the allowed percentage/number of engines to the set-up of a trading system whereby firms that would not use the entire flexibility could sell their flexibility rights to firms that need additional flexibility. The use of a scrapping scheme has been discarded as it is not suitable for assisting OEMs in financing R&D to make Stage III B machinery available. The set-up of a flexibility trading system was considered as a too complex system in a short time scale and thus disproportionate to the expected results. The option of increasing the existing flexibility scheme and extending it to sectors not yet included has been considered as the best option, balancing the environmental impact and an economic benefit in saved compliance costs for a limited period of time. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. the proposal makes the following amendments to Directive 97/68/EC: CONTENT: it is proposed to modify the provisions of the flexibility scheme to mitigate further the economic costs of the transition of emission Stages III A to III B by extending its application for some type of non-road mobile machinery while maintaining the entry into force of the exhaust emission limit Stage III B to preserve the objective of the Directive of reducing emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants in the Union. In addition, some engine manufacturers have progressed in developing compliant IIIB engines for locomotives while OEMs will yet not be entirely ready to place III B compliant locomotives on the market by 1st January 2012 as provided for in the Directive Therefore it appeared necessary to apply the flexibility scheme also to locomotives. The main amendments to the Directive are as follows: an increase of the percentage of the number of engines used for application in land based machines, placed on the market under the flexibility scheme in each engine category from 20% to 50% of the OEM’s annual sales of equipment and an adaptation of the maximum number of engines that may be placed on the market under the flexibility scheme as an optional alternative, in the period between emission Stage III A to emission Stage III B; inclusion of engines used for the propulsion of railcars and locomotives in the flexibility scheme providing the possibility for the OEM to place on the market a limited number of engines under the flexibility scheme; these measures will expire on 31 December 2013. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: with regard to child victims, the main cause of this phenomenon is vulnerability resulting from a variety of factors. Insufficient response by law enforcement mechanisms contributes to the prevalence of these phenomena, and the difficulties are exacerbated because certain forms of offences transcend national borders. Victims are reluctant to report abuse, variations in national criminal law and procedure may give rise to differences in investigation and prosecution, and convicted offenders may continue to be dangerous after serving their sentences. Developments in information technology have made these problems more acute by making it easier to produce and distribute child sexual abuse images while offering offenders anonymity and spreading responsibility across jurisdictions. Ease of travel and income differences fuel so-called child sex tourism, resulting often in child sex offenders committing offences abroad with impunity. National legislation covers some of these problems, to varying degrees. However, it is not strong or consistent enough to provide a vigorous social response to this disturbing phenomenon. The recent Council of Europe Convention CETS No. 201 on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (""the COE Convention"") arguably constitutes the highest international standard for protecting children against sexual abuse and exploitation to date. However, not all Member States have yet acceded to this Convention. At EU level, Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA, introduces a minimum of approximation of Member States’ legislation to criminalise the most serious forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation, to extend domestic jurisdiction, and to provide for a minimum of assistance to victims. Although the requirements have generally been put into implementation, the Framework Decision has a number of shortcomings. It approximates legislation only on a limited number of offences, does not address new forms of abuse and exploitation using information technology, does not remove obstacles to prosecuting offences outside national territory, does not meet all the specific needs of child victims, and does not contain adequate measures to prevent offences. It is therefore necessary to recast this text in order to respond to the needs of these new challenges. It should be noted that this proposal would replace existing legislation in place since 2004, and builds on a proposal made on 25/03/2009. After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, this proposal has to be reshaped. This will allow the Commission to verify that EU law is correctly translated into national rules and take those countries that are not complying to Court. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered several options: option 1 : no new EU action; option 2 : complement existing legislation with non-legislative measures: Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA, would not be amended. Instead, non-legislative measures could be put in place to support coordinated implementation of national legislation. This would include exchanging information and experience in prosecution, protection or prevention, awareness raising, cooperation with private sector and encouragement of self regulation, or the setting up of mechanisms for data collection; option 3 : new legislation on prosecuting offenders, protecting victims, and preventing offences: a new legislative act would be adopted, incorporating the existing Framework Decision, certain provisions of the COE Convention, and additional elements not contained in either of these. It would cover prosecution of offenders, protection of the victims, and prevention of the phenomenon; option 4 : new comprehensive legislation: the existing provisions of Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA would be supplemented by EU action to amend substantive criminal law and procedure, protect victims, and prevent offences as under option 3, plus the non-legislative measures identified under option 2 to improve the implementation of national legislation. Following the analysis of the economic impact, social impacts, and impacts on fundamental rights, options 3 and 4 represent the best approach to the problems and achieve the objectives of the proposal. The preferred option would be option 4, followed by option 3. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82 (2) and 83 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Given the cross-border dimension, EU action is required as the objective of effectively protecting children cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States, either at central level or at regional or local level. CONTENT: the proposal will both repeal and incorporate Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA to include the following new elements: substantive criminal law : serious forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation currently not covered by EU legislation would be criminalised. This includes, for instance, the organisation of travel arrangements with the purpose of committing sexual abuse, something particularly relevant, but not exclusively, in the context of child sex tourism. The definition of child pornography is amended to approximate it to the COE Convention and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Special consideration is given to offences against children in a particularly vulnerable situation. In particular, the level of criminal penalties should be increased so that they are proportionate, effective and dissuasive. To determine the degree of seriousness and attach penalties proportionate to it, consideration is given to different factors which may intervene in very different sorts of offences, like the degree of harm to the victim, the level of culpability of the offender and the level of risk posed to society. Accordingly, a number of relations between offences can be established. In general terms, activities involving sexual contact are more serious than those which do not; the presence of exploitation makes the offence more serious than its absence; coercion, force or threats are more serious than abuse of a position of power of the offender or weakness of the victim, which in turn is more serious than free consent of the victim. Prostitution, which involves sexual activities and money, is more serious than pornographic performances, which may or may not include them; recruiting to prostitution or similar is more serious than mere causing, as it involves active seeking of children as commodities. On child pornography, production, usually involving recruiting and sexual contact with the child, is more serious than other offences like distribution or offering, which in turn are more serious than possession or access. As a result of combining these different criteria, distinction is thus made between five different groups of offences, depending on their degree of seriousness, leading to accordingly different levels of penalties for the basic crimes; new criminal offences in the IT environment : new forms of sexual abuse and exploitation facilitated by the use of IT would be criminalised. This includes on-line pornographic performances, or knowingly obtaining access to child pornography, to cover cases where viewing child pornography from websites without downloading or storing the images does not amount to ""possession of"" or ""procuring"" child pornography. Also the new offence of ""grooming"" is incorporated closely following the wording agreed in the COE Convention. criminal investigation and initiation of criminal proceedings : a number of provisions would be introduced to assist with investigating offences and bringing charges. A mechanism to coordinate prosecution in cases of multiple jurisdictions is included, but may be superseded once the proposal for a Framework Decision on conflict of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings is adopted; prosecution of offences committed abroad : rules on jurisdiction would be amended to ensure that child sexual abusers or exploiters from the EU, both nationals and habitual residents, face prosecution even if they commit their crimes outside the EU, via so-called sex tourism; protection of victims : new provisions will be included to ensure that victims have easy access to legal remedies and do not suffer from participating in criminal proceedings. They cover assistance and support to victims, and protection of victims specifically in criminal investigations and proceedings; prevention of offences : amendments would be introduced to help prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation offences, through a number of actions concentrating on previous offenders to prevent recidivism, and to restrict access to child pornography on the internet. The aim of restricting such access is to reduce the circulation of child pornography by making it more difficult to use the publicly-accessible Web. It is not a substitute for action to remove the content at the source or to prosecute offenders; other protective measures not contained in the COE Convention : the proposal includes elements not contained in the COE Convention, notably: (i) ensuring implementation across the EU of prohibitions from activities with children imposed on offenders; (ii) blocking access to child pornography on the internet; (iii) criminalising coercing a child into sexual relations with a third party and child sexual abuse online; (iv) a non-punishment clause for child victims. It also goes beyond the obligations imposed by the COE Convention regarding the level of penalties, free legal counselling for child victims and repression of activities encouraging abuse and child sex tourism. Moreover, incorporating provisions from the Convention into EU law will facilitate faster adoption of national measures compared to national procedures for ratification, and ensure better monitoring of implementation. Territorial scope : the adoption of the proposal will be addressed to the Member States. The application of the resulting Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols (No 21) and (No 22) annexed to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: work on the creation of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) started in May 1999, on the basis of the principles approved by the Tampere European Council. During the first phase of the CEAS (1999-2005), the goal was to harmonise Member States' legal frameworks on the basis of minimum standards. Directive 2004/83/EC, otherwise known as the ‘Qualification Directive’ was adopted with the purpose of defining common criteria for the identification of persons in need of international protection and to ensure that at least a minimum level of benefits is available for these persons in all Member States. It is one of the key components of five EU legislative instruments in the area of asylum adopted in the context of the first phase. This proposal falls within the Policy Plan on Asylum which provides for the second phase of the CEAS. It aims to address the deficiencies in procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection and to ensure higher and more harmonised standards of protection, thus progressing towards a common asylum procedure and a uniform status. The amendments that have been proposed are drawn from the responses received to the Commission’s consultation on the Green Paper on the future of the Common European Asylum System which highlighted deficiencies concerning the terms of the Directive and the manner in which it is applied in practice. The minimum standards envisaged in 2004 are vague and ambiguous, in certain aspects, thus resulting in legal uncertainty. In view of the lack of clarity in regard to certain provisions and the incompatibility of certain standards with human rights or the applicable international law, the Commission proposes to recast the 2004 text at the same time as the recasting of Council Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (""Asylum Procedures Directive”). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: because of the variety of reasons underlying the difficulties in applying this directive, it was impossible to identify a single all-embracing option. The Commission’s impact assessment thus comprises a series of strategic options that would: i) restrict the broad interpretations of the notions of “actors of protection” and “internal protection” so that they are more compatible with the applicable international standards (Geneva Convention and European Court of Human Rights); ii) guarantee a broader interpretation of the notion of a ‘particular social group’ by defining better the importance to be accorded to aspects relating to the gender of asylum seekers; iii) reduce the difference between the rights of those with subsidiary protection and of refugees by removing certain provisions that are not justified; iv) improve the integration of beneficiaries of protection by taking into account their specific needs (e.g. assistance to find jobs, housing, ....); v) strengthen respect for the right to family life of beneficiaries of protection to cover minors, in the best interests of the child. CONTENT: the proposed amendments should contribute to: · the simplification of decision-making procedures leading to more robust determinations in the first instance, thus preventing abuse; · the rationalisation of the procedures for the granting of rights, thus improving the efficiency of the asylum procedures and reducing secondary asylum movements resulting from the coexistence of differing national decision-making practices and legal frameworks; · ensuring consistency with the jurisprudence with respect to human rights of the European Court of Justice and of the European Court of Human Rights. The main proposed changes to the provisions may be summarised as follows: a) “actors of protection” : the lack of clarity of the concept allows for wide divergences and for very broad interpretations which may fall short of the standards set by the Geneva Convention on what constitutes ‘adequate protection’. It also lays down that protection should be effective and durable and that non-state actors of protection should be willing and able to enforce the rule of law. The condition that protection should be effective and durable ensures coherence with Article 11(2) of the Directive, which requires, for the purposes of cessation, that the change of circumstances in the country of origin should be significant and of non-temporary nature; b) internal protection : the purpose and content of international protection are not limited to non-refoulement. It is necessary thus to specify that it may be withheld only where protectionis available in at least part of the country of origin. · introduces verbatim the pre-conditions set out in the above judgment for the applicability of the concept of internal protection, namely that the applicant should be able to travel, gain admittance and settle in the alternative location; · deletes the possibility to apply the internal flight alternative; · includes a reference to the obligation of the authorities to obtain precise and up-to-date information on the general situation in the country. c) the ""causal link"" requirement : in many cases where the persecution emanates from non-State actors, such as militia, clans, criminal networks, local communities or families, the act of persecution is not committed for reasons related to a Geneva Convention ground but, for instance, with criminal motivations or for private revenge. However, it often happens in such cases that the State is unable or unwilling to provide protection to the individual concerned (for example religion, gender, ethnicity etc). To address potential protection gaps, the proposal makes explicit that the requirement of a connection between the acts of persecution and the reasons for persecution is also fulfilled where there is a connection between the acts of persecution and the absence of protection against such acts. d) membership of a particular social group : gender as such is normally not sufficient as a criterion for the definition of a particular social group; it is generally used in combination with other factors, such as class, marital status, ethnic or clan affiliation. However, women may form a particular social group in some societies, as evidenced by discrimination in their fundamental rights. The ambiguous wording of the last phrase of Article 10(1)(d) allows for protection gaps and for very divergent interpretations. In order to provide clear and useful guidance and ensure consistency, the amendment specifies that gender should be given due consideration for the purposes of defining a particular social group. e) cessation of refugee and subsidiary protection status : references to the exceptions to the “ceased circumstances” cessation clauses, set out in the Geneva Convention, have been omitted from the Qualification Directive. These exceptions provide for the continuation of protection for ""compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution"" and are interpreted as reflecting a general humanitarian principle. The proposal introduces these exceptions with regard both to refugee status and to subsidiary protection. f) differentiation regarding the content of the two protection statuses : an amendment expected to significantly simplify and streamline procedures and to reduce administrative costs is aimed at approximating the rights granted to the two categories of beneficiaries of protection. When subsidiary protection was introduced, it was assumed that this status was of a temporary nature. As a result, the Directive allows Member States the discretion to grant them a lower level of rights in certain respects. However, practical experience acquired so far has shown that this initial assumption was not accurate. It is thus necessary to remove any limitations of the rights of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection which can no longer be considered as necessary and objectively justified. Such an approximation of rights is necessary to ensure full respect of the principle of non-discrimination and responds moreover to the call of the Hague Programme for the creation of a uniform status of protection. g) content of protection : to ensure the effective exercise of the rights formally granted to beneficiaries of protection, it is necessary to address the specific integration challenges they face, in particular: · recognition of qualifications : In order to address the practical difficulties flowing from their inability to provide documentary evidence and their limited financial capacities, the proposal encourages Member States to adopt alternative appropriate procedures and exempt them from the fees involved or grant them financial assistance, where necessary. · access to vocational training and employment : beneficiaries of protection are often unable to work for years or they are unfamiliar with labour market requirements and recruitment practices. The proposal obliges Member States to offer them access to training courses to upgrade their skills and to counselling services offered by employment offices; · access to integration facilities : The effective integration opportunities of beneficiaries of protection would be significantly enhanced if the different educational and professional backgrounds or other specificities of their situation were adequately taken into account in the integration facilities. The proposal requires Member States to develop in their integration policies the response that they consider appropriate to meet those specific needs; · access to accommodation : Many beneficiaries of protection experience direct and indirect discrimination in the housing market. The proposal calls on Member States to put in place policies aimed at preventing discrimination and achieving equality of opportunity; possibilities for reduction of benefits in cases of ""manufactured"" claims : these possibilities are not conducive to integration and raise concerns from the perspective of the principle of non-discrimination. Furthermore, their limited use in practice points to their limited added value. h) family members : the definition of family members is extended so as to take into account the case where the beneficiary of protection is a minor and the wide range of situations where a minor might be dependent, while ensuring that the decisive criterion is the best interest of the child."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: Australian legislation empowers the Australian Customs Service to require each air carrier operating passenger flight to and from Australia to provide it with electronic access to Passenger Name Record (PNR) data prior to the passenger arriving or leaving Australia. The requirements of the Australian authorities are based on the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Administration Act 1985, the Migration Act 1958, the Crimes Act 1914, the Privacy Act 1988 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982. This legislation aims at obtaining PNR data electronically in advance of a flight's arrival and therefore significantly enhances the Australian Customs Service’s ability to conduct efficient and effective advance risk assessment of passenger and to facilitate bona fide travel, thereby enhancing the security of Australia. The European Union in cooperating with Australia in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime views the transfer of data to Australia as fostering international police and judicial cooperation which will be achieved though the transfer of analytical information flowing from PNR data by Australia to the competent Member States authorities as well as Europol and Eurojust within their respective competences. The European Union signed an agreement in 2008 with Australia on the transfer and processing of PNR data based on a set of commitments by the Australian Customs Service in relation to the application of its PNR programme. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and pending the conclusion of the agreement, the Council sent the 2008 Australia Agreement to the European Parliament for its consent for the conclusion. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it decided to postpone its vote on the requested consent and requesting a renegotiation of the Agreement on the basis of certain criteria (see RSP/2010/2657 ). Pending such renegotiation, the 2008 Agreement would remain provisionally applicable. On 23 September 2010, the Council received three recommendations from the Commission to authorise the opening of negotiations for an Agreement between the European Union and Australia for the transfer and use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational crime. On 11 November 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Recommendation from the Commission to the Council to authorise the opening of the negotiations. On 2 December 2010, the Council adopted a Decision, together with a negotiation directive, authorising the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the European Union. It is now proposed to conclude the Agreement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a), in conjunction with Article 218 (6)(a) of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal aims to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. PNR and basic principles of the Agreement : to recall, PNR is a record of each passenger' travel requirements which contains all information necessary to enable reservations to be processed and controlled by air carriers.Air carriers are under an obligation to provide the Australian Customs Service with access to certain PNR data to the extent it is collected and contained in the air carrier's automated reservation and departure control systems. However, the data protection laws of the EU do not allow European and other carriers operating flight from the EU to transmit the PNR data of their passengers to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data without adducing appropriate safeguards. Accordingly, a solution is required that will provide the legal basis for the transfer of PNR data from the EU to Australia as a recognition of the necessity and importance of the use of PNR data in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime, whilst avoiding legal uncertainty for air carriers. In addition, this solution should be applied homogenously throughout the European Union in order to ensure a legal certainty for air carriers and respect of individuals' rights to the protection of personal data as well as their physical security. Safeguards: the Agreement has secured several important safeguards for those whose data will be transferred and processed. In particular, the purpose of processing of PNR data is strictly limited to preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious transnational crime. Individuals are provided with the right to access, correction, redress and information. The data will be transferred using exclusively the 'push' method and the use of sensitive data is prohibited. Retention period: the retention period of the PNR data is limited and the data will be depersonalised after a certain period. Compliance: compliance with these rules shall be subject to independent oversight by the Australian Information Commissioner. Fundamental rights: the Agreement respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, and the right to effective remedy and fair trial. The United Kingdom and Ireland take part in the adoption of the Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: on 16 September 2008, the Commission presented a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Second Council Directive 77/91/EEC on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent. In its opinion of 16 October 2008 the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services stated that the proposal does indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it. On 26 August 2010 the Commission presented an amended proposal for the codification of Directive 77/91/EEC, following subsequent amendments to it. In its further opinion of 12 October 2010 the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services stated that that amended proposal does indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it. In that opinion the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services also acknowledged that Article 6(3) of Directive 77/91/EEC, which corresponds to Article 6(2) in the proposed codified text, established a secondary legal basis. In the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of 6 May 2008 in Case C-133/06, it was considered necessary to redraft Article 6(2) of the proposed codified text. Since such a redrafting would imply a substantive change, and would therefore go beyond straightforward codification, it is therefore appropriate to transform the codification of Directive 77/91/EEC into a recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendment. The amendment to be made to Article 6(2) of the proposed codified text concerns the insertion of the words ""the European Parliament and"" before the words ""the Council"", in order to confer on both institutions the competence to examine and, if need be, revise the minimum amount of EUR 25 000 required for a company to be incorporated or obtain authorisation to commence business.

It is an established and common practice in most financial markets. Short selling can be divided into two types: covered short selling where the seller has borrowed the security, or made arrangements to ensure they can be borrowed before the short sale and uncovered or naked short selling (where at the time of the short sale the seller has not borrowed the securities or ensured they can be borrowed). At the height of the financial crisis, in September 2008, competent authorities in several EU Member States and the USA adopted emergency measures to restrict or ban short selling in some or all securities. The measures adopted by Member States were divergent as the European Union lacks a specific legislative framework for dealing with short selling issues. Earlier this year concerns were expressed by some Member States about the possible role played by derivative transactions, notably credit default swaps, in relation to the prices for Greek sovereign bonds. A number of Member States (notably Germany and Greece) have recently adopted temporary or permanent restrictions at national level relating to short selling of shares and/or credit default swaps. The current fragmented approach to short selling and credit default swaps limits the effectiveness of supervision and the measures imposed and results in regulatory arbitrage. It may also create confusion in markets and costs and difficulties for market participants. In its communication of 2 June 2010 on Regulating Financial Services for Sustainable Growth, the Commission considered that it would be desirable to have a regulation addressing the potential risks arising from short selling. The intention is to i) harmonise requirements relating to short selling across the European Union, ii) harmonise the powers that regulators may use in exceptional situations where there is a serious threat to financial stability or market confidence and iii) ensure greater co-ordination and consistency between Member States in such situations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options related to the scope of the proposals, the proposed transparency regimes, requirements relating to uncovered short selling, exemptions and exceptional powers to restrict short selling. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Although all the problems outlined above have important implications for each individual Member State, their overall impact can only be fully perceived in a cross-border context. CONTENT: the proposal covers all financial instruments but provides for a proportionate response to the risks that that short selling of different instruments may represent. Its main features are as follows: Transparency requirements for short positions in certain instruments: for instruments such as shares and derivatives relating to shares, sovereign bonds and derivatives relating to sovereign bonds and credit default swaps relating to sovereign issuers where taking short positions is more common and there are clearly identifiable risks or concerns, transparency requirements and requirements relating to uncovered short selling are applied. For companies that have shares admitted to trading on a trading venue in the Union, the proposal provides for a two tier model for transparency of significant net short positions in shares. At a lower threshold notification of a position must be made privately to the regulator and at a higher threshold positions must be disclosed to the market. As regards significant net short positions relating to sovereign debt issuers in the EU, private disclosure to regulators is required. The proposal includes a requirement for the marking of short orders. A requirement for the marking or flagging of sell orders executed on trading venues as short orders where the seller is entering into a short sale of shares on that venue will provide additional information about volumes of short sales executed on the trading venue. A trading venue will be required to publish daily information about volumes of short sales executed on the venue that is obtained from the marking of orders. Uncovered short sales : uncovered or naked short selling of shares and sovereign debt is sometimes viewed as increasing the potential risk of settlement failure and market volatility. The proposals include detailed requirements aimed at addressing these risks. To this end, natural or legal persons entering into short sales of such instruments must at the time of the sale have borrowed the instruments, entered into an agreement to borrow the shares or made other arrangements which ensure that the security can be borrowed so that settlement can be effected when it is due. Furthermore, trading venues must ensure that there are adequate arrangements in place for buy-in of shares or sovereign debt where there is a failure to settle a transaction. Trading venues will have the power to prohibit a natural or legal person who failed to settle to enter into further short sales. Exemptions: provisions are made for exemptions – for example, for shares of a company where the principal market for the shares is outside the European Union and for market making activities which play a crucial role in providing liquidity to European markets. Intervention powers:  in exceptional situations which constitute a serious threat to financial stability or to market confidence, competent authorities should have temporary powers to require further transparency or to impose restrictions on short selling and credit default swap transactions or limit natural and legal persons from entering into derivative transactions. Where an adverse development or event creates a threat to financial stability or market confidence that extends beyond one Member State or has other cross border implications, the proposal introduces various procedural requirements aimed at ensuring that other competent authorities are notified if a competent authority intends to take exceptional measures related to short selling. The European Securities Market Authority ( ESMA ) is given a key coordination role in such a situation to try to ensure consistency between competent authorities. Powers and sanctions: t he proposal gives competent authorities all the powers necessary for the enforcement of the rules. For example, the powers cover access to documents, the right to obtain information from natural or legal persons and to take enforcement action."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: concerned at the decline of the European railway sector witnessed since the 1970s, the European Community adopted a certain number of legislative measures aimed at reviving the railways by gradually creating a “single European railway area”. The first railway package Directive 2001/12/EC, Directive 2001/12/EC and Directive 2001/13/EC -adopted at the end of 2000 signalled the desire to reform the regulatory framework to ensure the railway sector's integration at European level and to enable it to face up to the competition from other transport modes on the best possible terms. With this new regulatory framework, the railway industry has managed to stabilise the volumes transported and, in some Member States, to recover market share from the roads. However, the growth of rail freight in terms of tonnes transported during recent years has not been strong enough to recover the market share of 2.3 percentage points lost between 1995 and 2003. The current economic climate is exacerbating the weak performance of the rail market. Freight services (including rail) have recently suffered a significant drop in activity (between 20% and 50% depending on the market segment) and passenger service activity has also slowed. The development of the railway sector and its capacity to compete viably with other modes of transport are still hampered by serious problems related to (a) inadequate financing and pricing of the infrastructure, (b) persistent barriers to competition and (c) lack of appropriate regulatory oversight. Two problems need to be addressed: the level of investment in rail infrastructure development and maintenance remains insufficient in a large number of Member States. In many cases, the quality of the infrastructure continues to decline: competition between railway undertakings is limited by various factors. Insufficient transparency of market conditions and a poorly functioning institutional framework continue to make it difficult for new entrants to provide competitive rail services. T here are weaknesses, ambiguities and gaps in the current regulatory framework which need to be addressed to meet fully the initial objectives of the legislation. A recast of the first railway package is considered by the Commission as one of the ways to tackle them. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on extensive research and evaluation, the Commission came up with 37 measures that could potentially contribute to achieving each of the objectives of the proposal. A thorough pre-screening of these 37 measures resulted in the selection of a package of 26 measures. Following the decision to carry out an impact assessment for an initiative to recast the first railway package, an external study was commissioned to PriceWaterhouseCoopers Advisory(PWC). A stakeholders’ consultation involving almost 380 organisations was carried out in the context of the external study undertaken by PWC. Based on the external study, as well as the conclusions of the stakeholders' consultation process, the Commission made a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the impact of the whole package of pre-selected measures. It examined alternative options for the new measures envisaged to modernise the existing regulatory framework, some of which had not previously been subject to impact assessment. LEGAL BASE: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed recast has three horizontal objectives: 1) The simplificati on, clarification and modernisation of the regulatory environment in Europe : legal simplificationthrough consolidation and merger is the first horizontal objective underpinning this recast initiative. Elimination of existing cross-references of the three Directives through restructuring and merging into a single rail access code would be instrumental in attaining this objective. 2) The clarification of some provisions of rail access legislation would facilitate proper transposition and efficient implementation of European Union law in all Member States. 3) The modernisation of the legislation by eliminating outdated provisions and the introduction of new provisions which respond more appropriately to the functioning of the market today (e.g. relating to new entrants and full or partial State ownership of infrastructure). The proposed recast of the first railway package encompasses (a) the adequate financing of and charging for rail infrastructures, (b) the conditions of competition on the railway market, and (c) the organisational reforms needed to ensure appropriate supervision of the market. The first objective consists of e nsuring adequate, transparent and sustainable funding of the infrastructure and, thanks to better predictability of the infrastructure development and access conditions, i) facilitating investments by railway undertakings, together with a more appropriate level and structure of infrastructure charging, ii) improving the competitiveness of rail operators vis-à-vis other transport modes and iii) contributing to the internalisation of environmental costs The second series of objectives involves i) avoiding distortions of competition due to the use of State funds for commercial activities, ii) preventing commercially sensitive information from being collected by incumbents and used against their potential competitors, iii) eliminating conflicts of interest in the management of rail-related services and iv) increasing their availability for new entrants as well as v) increasing market transparency to ensure effective competition. Regarding regulatory oversight, the proposed recast intends to ensure that regulatory bodies are in a position to carry out their duties effectively, thanks to reinforced independence, extended competencies, and additional means at their disposal. The main proposed amendments are as follows: the separation of accounts between the activities that enjoy a legal monopoly from those that are subject to competition; the obligation for Member States to publish medium to long-term railway sector development strategies that make it possible to meet future mobility needs and are based on sound and sustainable financing of the railway system. It will stimulate long lifecycle investments on which the rail industry relies; a clarification of the general principles applying to cross-agreements between rail undertakings, between Member States, and between Member States and third countries; the updating of the provisions relating to the responsibilities of the regulatory bodies. Their competences will explicitly cover decisions related to access to and charging for rail-related services which are essential to allow market entry and ensure fair competition; to enhance cross-border cooperation and improve market entry conditions, regulatory bodies will have to cooperate for the adoption of decisions on access or charging issues relating to international services; the rail market monitoring tasks of the Commission will cover items such as rail infrastructure investments, price developments and quality of rail transport services and public service obligations for rail passenger transport. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: On 10 October 2007, the Commission published the Communication on an Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union (‘Blue Paper’), which was accompanied by an action plan which sets out a number of actions to be taken as a first step in implementing a newIMP. In October 2009, the Commission adopted a Progress Report on the EU’s which charted the course for its next implementation phase. In its conclusions of 16 November 2009, the General Affairs Council highlighted the importance of funding for the further development and implementation of the IMP by inviting the Commission to present the necessary proposals for the financing of integrated maritime policy actions within the existing Financial Perspective, with a view to entry into force by 2011. Further development and implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy along the lines set out by the Commission and endorsed by the Council is at risk because there are insufficient means to fund the necessary actions over the remaining period (2011 – 2013) of the current Financial Perspective. Pilot schemes and preparatory actions relating to the Integrated Maritime Policy can be financed only until the end of 2010. A continued modest financial underpinning is needed to enable the EU to implement and further develop the Integrated Maritime Policy in line with Parliament’s resolution of 20 May 2008 and to pursue the overarching objectives as set out in the Commission's Blue Paper, confirmed in the Progress Report and endorsed by the General Affairs Council conclusions of November 2009. This financing will enable the continuation of the exploratory work that has already been initiated through preparatory actions and pilot projects, and to further develop and concretise options for implementation of the IMP. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is not accompanied by an impact assessment. Nevertheless, the Commission conducted an ex-ante evaluation of the most detailed aspects of the proposed financing programme. The three policy alternatives identified in the ex-ante evaluation are the following: Option 2: a modest EU financial contribution, at a reasonably increased level compared to the preparatory and pilot projects so far, for further exploring options and steadily implementing the IMP as it develops; Taking into account the limitations of options 1 and 3 and the strong Community interest in achieving the IMP's objectives in the short to medium term, the appropriate solution would seem to be Option 2, i.e. a modest EU financial contribution to fund IMP activities for the period 2011-2013. LEGAL BASE: the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy has no explicit legal basis in the Treaty. However, it covers many EU sectoral policies with a bearing on the seas and coasts such as fisheries, freedom, security and justice, transport, industry, territorial cohesion, research, environment, energy, and tourism. That is why the proposed legislative act is based on Article 43(2), Article 74 and 77(2), Article 91(1) and 100(2), Article 173(3), Article 175, Article 188, Article 192(1), Article 194(2) and Article 195(2). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to establish a programme to support the further development of an Integrated Maritime Policy. The general objective of the proposed Programme is to provide adequate finances for further developing and implementing the Integrated Maritime Policy. This action follows on from preparatory actions and pilot projects to be launched from January 2011 till December 2013. The actions and activities financed by the proposed Programme will aim to help achieve the following objectives: further development and implementation of integrated maritime governance and integrated approaches within Member States and coastal regions; speedy and sound implementation of integrated sea basin strategies around Europe tailored to the needs of each maritime region; further development and implementation of cross-cutting tools for integrated policymaking including a European Marine Observation and Data Network, integrating maritime surveillance namely through the establishment of a Common Information Sharing Environment, Maritime Spatial Planning and Integrated Coastal Zone Management; further defining in the years the boundaries of sustainability of human activities that have an impact on the marine environment, in the framework of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive , paying due attention to their cumulative impacts on the basis of the ecosystem approach; promotion of the international dimension of the Integrated Maritime Policy by improving and fostering dialogue, cooperation and coordination with third countries, including those bordering a European sea basin, or actors in third countries, as well as with international partners and organisations on the Integrated Maritime Policy, ensuring coherence with the actions developed in the sectoral policies; putting renewed focus on sustainable economic growth, employment and innovation; raising the visibility of Maritime Europe, and promoting and facilitating the sharing of information, the exchange of best practices, the exploitation and reinforcement of synergies and dialogue with and among stakeholders on maritime governance and sectoral policies that have an impact on the oceans, seas and coasts, or the establishment of cross-sectoral cooperation platforms and networks at a horizontal and at sea-basin level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial envelope for implementing the Programme to support the further development of the Integrated Maritime Policy is set at EUR 50 000 000 and it will apply from 1 January 2011 until 31 December 2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Member States have had positive experiences with repayable assistance schemes at the level of operations during the programming period 2000-2006 and have therefore continued such schemes or have started to implement repayable assistance schemes in the current programming period 2007-2013. Some Member States have also included descriptions of those schemes in their programming documents, which were approved by the Commission. Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund set out financial engineering instruments with precise areas and scope of intervention. However, the schemes implemented by Member States in the form of reimbursable grants and of credit lines managed by managing authorities via intermediate bodies are neither appropriately covered by the provisions on financial engineering instruments, nor by other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. It is therefore necessary to set out in a new Section of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 that the Structural Funds may co-finance repayable assistance. That Section should cover reimbursable grants and credit lines managed by the managing authority through intermediate bodies which are public financial institutions. IMPACT ANALYSIS: t he present proposal will clarify the use of repayable forms of assistance at project level, a practice which has been well established in the programming period 2000-2006 and will give the use of structural funds a further boost and higher leverage. The proposal aims to provide clarity about the legality of an existing legal practice. The main expected impact is thus the reduction of legal risk. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he proposal seeks to provide legal security at the level of European Union that support provided by Member States through Structural Funds to schemes based on repayable forms of assistance implemented lawfully in the previous programming period and/or started in the current period but not having the characteristics of financial engineering instruments are permitted and legitimate under the present Structural Fund regulations. The proposed modifications to the current regulatory framework are as follows: provides for a definition of reimbursable grant as a direct financial contributions by way of donation which can be totally or partially reimbursable without interest; establish that the Structural Funds may finance expenditure in respect of an operation comprising contributions to support repayable assistance. This provision covers reimbursable grants and credit lines managed by the managing authority through intermediate bodies which are ""in-house"" public financial institutions; clarify that the assistance repaid, to the body providing the assistance or to another competent public authority of the Member State shall be kept in a separate account and reused to the same purpose or in line with the objectives of the operational programme; clarify that provisions regarding major projects, revenue generating projects and durability of operations shall not, as a matter of principle, apply to financial engineering instruments under, since these rules are rather conceived for other types of assistance; introduce reporting of financial engineering instruments, having regard to the need to ensure appropriate monitoring, by the Member States as well as by the Commission, of the implementation of financial engineering instruments; introduce a legal obligation in order to ensure that the financial contribution paid by managing authorities for establishing or contributing to financial engineering instruments is spent for eligible expenditure within a timeframe of two years of the payment into the fund. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of Structural Funds financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007-2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the deepening of the financial crisis in some of the Member States is affecting substantially the real economy due to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by Governments to borrow money from the market. In this context, the proper implementation of cohesion programmes is of particular importance because it facilitates financial assistance to the real economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the euro countries or from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non euro countries. To date, six countries have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme: Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. These Member States (and indeed any other Member State which may be concerned in the future by such assistance programmes) should receive help to continue the implementation of the Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund programmes by increasing the sums allocated to the countries concerned for the period for which they are under the support mechanisms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to increase payments to the countries concerned, for the period they are under the support mechanisms. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal contains provisions that would allow the Commission to increase payments to the countries most affected by the financial crisis for the period for which they are under the support mechanisms, without changing their overall allocation under the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2007-2013. It is proposed to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund so as to enable the Commission, upon the request of the Member States concerned, to reimburse the newly declared expenditure for the period in question by an increased amount calculated by applying a 10 percentage points top-up of the applicable co-financing rates for the priority axis. In applying the top-up, the co-financing rate of the programme cannot exceed by more than 10 percentage points the maximum ceilings of Annex III to the General Regulation. In any case contribution from the funds to the priority axis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned in the Commission decision approving the operational programme. This will be a temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits the support mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPACT: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. For payment appropriations, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal will imply an increase of payment appropriations (for 2012 approximately EUR 2,304 million) which may be compensated by the end of the programming period. Therefore, the total payment appropriations for the whole programming period remain unchanged.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for bananas in the EU (EU) has traditionally provided a preferential trade regime in favour of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-exporting countries. For several ACP states, banana production for export to the EU forms an important economic activity with multiplier effects for the rest of the economy. The EU's banana CMO has been challenged since 1995 through the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Dispute Settlement Mechanism, whose Appellate Body decisions have repeatedly ruled against it. Consequently, the EU has negotiated a trade agreement on bananas within the framework of the WTO. This supports the completion of the Doha Development Agenda's (DDA) agricultural modalities and the full Doha Round. Implementation of this agreement will lead to the reduction of the ACPs' preference margin. In order to promote the gradual integration of banana-exporting ACP countries into the global economy, the EU has provided assistance to the banana sectors of a number of countries through the Special System of Assistance (SSA, 1994-1999) and the Special Framework of Assistance (SFA, 1999-2008). The SFA operated in 12 banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The SFA operated in twelve banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The external evaluation of the SFA highlights positive results, as stated in the draft Communication on the Biennial Report on the Special Framework of Assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas. Certain countries managed to enhance competitiveness, as reflected in ACP bananas' stable export volumes and EU market share (see COM(2010)0103). However, production costs in ACP countries generally remain higher than in Most Favoured Nation (MFN) countries. The results of measures to support diversification are less visible and will require more efforts. A reduction in tariff preferences for ACP banana-supplying countries will lead to additional adjustment requirements, building on the adaptation and restructuring processes underway. In view of these challenges, the Commission proposes to create an ACP Banana Accompanying Measures programme for the main ACP banana-supplying countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (“DCI instrument.) The Banana Accompanying Measures to be adopted aim at: enhancing the competitiveness of the banana export sector, where this is sustainable, taking into account the situation of different stakeholders in the chain; promoting the economic diversification of banana-dependent areas; addressing broader impacts generated by the adaptation process, possibly related but not restricted to employment and social services, land use and environmental restoration, and macroeconomic stability. They will take into account the results of and experiences gained through the SSA and the SFA. The Banana Accompanying Measures are proposed as a temporary programme with a maximum duration of four years (2010-2013). The main ACP banana supplying countries are: Belize, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname. The budget for the measures is EUR 190 million. Within this amount, the Commission will fix the maximum amount available to each eligible ACP banana-supplying country for financing the actions above on the basis of a set of objective indicators. The indicators shall include trade in bananas with the EU; the importance of banana exports to the economy in the ACP country concerned; and country's level of development. The measurement of the allocation criteria shall be based on data from years preceding 2009. The Commission will adopt multi-annual support strategies and ensure that such strategies complement the geographic strategy papers of the countries concerned, and the temporary nature of these banana accompanying measures. The support strategies may be reviewed ad hoc, if necessary, but shall not be submitted to a mid-term review. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budget is EUR 190 million. The programme will be financed through appropriations under the expenditure of Heading 4 (""The EU as a Global Player""). It is proposed to use part of the available margin under this heading for EUR 75.9 million. Commission services have assessed the availability of funds over the period 2010-2013 in order to ascertain redeployment possibilities because of potential underutilisation, absorption constraints and/or political circumstances. The analysis leads to a proposed redeployment of EUR 95.8 million under Heading 4. For the remainder (EUR 18.3 million) the Commission proposes the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument. Lastly, it should be noted that the total financial reference amount for the implementation of the DCI Regulation over the period 2007-2013 is now EUR 17 087 million."

BACKGROUND: since 2007 the Community has streamlined its geographical cooperation with developing countries in Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America and with Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and South Africa under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI). The scope of cooperation for the geographic programmes with developing countries, territories and regions established under the Regulation is furthermore limited materially to financing measures to eradicate poverty through the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is in the Community’s interests to further deepen its relations with the developing countries concerned, which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral for a (e.g. Brazil, India or China). It therefore needs a financial instrument that allows the financing of such measures which, by their nature, do not qualify as Official Development Assistance. For that purpose, four Preparatory Actions were set up in the 2007 and 2008 budget procedures to initiate enhanced cooperation in business and scientific exchanges with countries in Asia and Latin America. It is however necessary to provide a legal basis for this specific type of cooperation in order to formalise these exchanges with high-income group countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers 4 policy options: 1) No EU action: cooperation with the countries concerned remains strictly in the framework of the DCI regulation; 2) amend DCI Regulation: add an additional strand to the regulation to finance ‘non-ODA activities’ with a ring-fenced amount; 3) amend ICI Regulation: extend the geographical scope of the regulation to DCI countries with a ring-fenced amount; 4) table a new instrument. The different options have been analyzed on the criteria of coherence, efficiency and effectiveness. Option 1 is not considered a valid option in view of the need to fill the legislative gap. Option 2 would be the most coherent, but it is not recommended as it would bring different objectives under the same regulation: eradicating poverty and fostering Community interests. In conclusion, Option 3 is considered the most appropriate and effective legislative option in view of the major simplification of the financial instruments. CONTENT: the proposal thus intends to extend the geographical scope of the countries covered by the DCI Regulation which was initially set up for industrialised and high-income countries. The primary objective of cooperation shall be to provide a specific response to the need to strengthen links and to engage further with them on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis in order to create a more favourable environment for the development of the relations of the Community with these countries and territories and promote dialogue while fostering Community's interests. It shall be aimed at engaging with partners which share similar political, economic and institutional structures and values to the Community and which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral fora and in global governance. Two annexes have therefore been included in the Regulation: Annex I (existing) covering industrialised and other high-income countries and territories ; Annex II (new) covering DCI developing countries (46 countries). Furthermore, in duly justified circumstances and in order to foster regional cooperation, the Commission may decide when adopting action programmes that countries not listed in the Annexes are eligible, where the project or programme to be implemented is of regional or cross-border nature. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: additional appropriations are requested for this new type of cooperation – corresponding to the continuation of the 2007 to 2008 preparatory actions. As a result, although the financial envelope amounts to EUR 176 million, the budgetary impact is EUR 67.5 million from 2010 to 2013 to cover activities relating to the follow-up of these actions."

CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding.

They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid ""in beneficiary countries"", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the EIDHR and on the parallel proposal amending the DCI."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Council and the European Parliament adopted in 2006 a Regulation laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States (""Local Border Traffic Regulation"") which allows derogating, for persons living in a border area, from the general rules on border checks set out in the Schengen Borders Code. The Regulation authorises Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with neighbouring non-EU countries, provided these agreements fully comply with the parameters set by the Regulation. In February 2011, the Commission concluded in a report that the local border traffic regime makes life significantly easier for people living near the external land borders, while at the same time there is little evidence that the regime is being abused. It also stated that given the specific position of Kaliningrad (the Kaliningrad region of Russia with a population of almost one million inhabitants became the only enclave within the EU as a consequence of the 2004 EU enlargement) an amendment of the Local Border Traffic Regulation may be justified. In order to avoid Kaliningrad's isolation from its immediate neighbours, there is a need to facilitate travel for its inhabitants. For the Regulation to have real effect in that region, a specific border area on the Polish side should be included in the eligible border area as well, in order to facilitate and enhance economic and cultural interchange between the Kaliningrad oblast on the one hand and major centres in the North of Poland on the other. This proposal will contribute to further promoting the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, in line with the priorities set out in the Roadmap of the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice regarding cross-border cooperation and shall be considered in the context of the overall EU- Russia relationship. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77 (2) (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 so that the following areas shall be considered as eligible border area, as defined in the Regulation: 1. Kaliningrad Oblast 2.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is the second step in a series of measures in the Procedural Rights Roadmap, adopted in Council on 30 November 2009 inviting the Commission to put forward proposals on a step by step basis. It should therefore be considered as part of a comprehensive package of legislation to be presented over the next few years which will provide a minimum set of procedural rights in criminal proceedings in the European Union. The first step, on the right to interpretation and translation, is a Directive adopted on 8 October 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to improve the rights of suspects. Having common minimum standards in relation to these rights should facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition, thereby improving the functioning of judicial cooperation between Member States of the EU. The main points are as follows: Objective: the Directive lays down rules concerning the right of suspected and accused persons to information about their rights and about the charge in criminal proceedings against them. Scope: the Directive applies from the time that a person is made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State, by official notification or otherwise, that he is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings (including any appeal). It does not, however, apply in proceedings conducted by administrative authorities in relation to the breach of competition legislation, whether national or European, unless the case is brought before a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters. European Arrest Warrant proceedings are explicitly covered. In this respect, the Directive makes applicable the procedural guarantees contained in Articles 47 and 48 of the Charter and Articles 5 and 6 ECHR to surrender proceedings based on a European Arrest Warrant. Right to information about rights : the proposal lays down the general principle that all suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings should be informed about relevant procedural rights at the earliest possible moment in the proceedings. Such information should be given in simple and accessible language, orally or in writing. The proposal also sets out those minimum rights and Member States' obligations arising from the Charter, the ECHR, the ICCPR and applicable EU legislation, which are considered key to safeguarding the fairness of criminal proceedings at their outset. Right to written information about rights on arrest : the draft directive specifies Member States' general duty to inform suspected or accused persons about their procedural rights in cases where such persons are deprived of their liberty by Member States' competent authorities in the course of the criminal proceedings on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence (e.g. through arrest by the police and being placed in pre-trial detention on the order of a judge). Member States are required to inform these persons of their relevant rights in writing. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), has repeatedly stressed in its reports that, in its experience, the period immediately following deprivation of liberty is when the arrested person is considered to be most vulnerable in relation to risks of intimidation and physical ill-treatment. According to the CPT it is essential that a suspected or accused person is informed of his rights promptly, i.e. without delay after his arrest and in the most effective way which is by means of a form explaining the rights in a straightforward manner (Letter of Rights). In the light of recent European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence, Member States' competent authorities are required to ensure that the arrested person has a broad understanding of the information contained in the Letter of Rights. The arrested person must be allowed to keep the Letter of Rights throughout the time of his detention. The Letter of Rights should be drafted in language which is easily understood by a lay person without any knowledge of criminal procedure and should contain the information referred to in the draft directive. To promote consistency in the written information throughout the EU, Annex I to the Directive contains a model of the Letter of Rights which Member States may use. This model is indicative and may be subject to review in the context of the report on implementation to be presented by the Commission and also once all the Roadmap measures have come into force. The content of the model does not prejudice rights that currently apply in Member States. The Letter of Rights has to be provided to the suspected or accused person in a language he understands. Police authorities are expected to keep language versions for all commonly spoken languages in their locality available in electronic form that can be printed as the need arises. When a given language version is not available, the suspected or accused person should be informed of their rights orally in a language they understand and the Letter of Rights should be given to them without undue delay (i.e. as soon as it becomes available after translation into the relevant language). For persons who are partially sighted or blind, or who cannot read, Member States must have a method of transmitting the information. The right to written information about rights in European Arrest Warrant proceedings : different rights apply to persons subject to a European Arrest Warrant (e.g. the right to a hearing). Member States should ensure that a specific version of the Letter of Rights exists for persons subject to those proceedings. Annex II to the Directive contains a model of the Letter of Rights which Member States may use. This model is indicative and may be subject to review. The content of the model does not prejudice rights that currently apply in Member States. The right to information about the charge : once a person has been charged with a criminal offence, he should be given sufficient information promptly, in detail and in a language he understands, to enable him to prepare his defence, and to challenge pre-trial decisions if necessary. This is a requirement under the Charter and the ECHR. The text sets out exactly what information must be given as a minimum requirement. The right to access to the case-file : the most effective way to provide a suspected or accused person with detailed information about the charge in order to allow him adequately to prepare his defence at trial is to give him or his lawyer access to the case-file. Recent research shows that in the large majority of Member States access to the case-file is already granted at some point in the criminal proceedings. The ECtHR has consistently ruled that, depending on the stage of criminal proceedings, Member States are required to disclose to the defence all material evidence for or against the accused and to provide the accused person's lawyer with access to relevant documents contained in the case-file. The draft directive provides that where a suspected or accused person is arrested in the course of criminal proceedings, access to those documents contained in the case-file which are relevant to the determination of the lawfulness of the detention by the competent judicial authority should be granted. This limited access to the case-file ensures the fairness of pre-trial proceedings concerning the lawfulness of arrest and detention. In considering what documents and information access is being granted to, Member States should pay particular attention to the protection of the effectiveness of Leniency Programmes that are used in investigations under criminal law into cartel behaviour. The text requires Member States to grant access to the case-file to all accused persons whether or not they are in custody, where the criminal investigation is concluded. Access to certain documents in the case-file may be excluded by a competent judicial authority where access to those documents may lead to serious risk to the life of another person or may seriously harm the internal security of the Member State in which the proceedings are taking place. Such limitation of access to the file is only to be used in exceptional circumstances. Access to the case-file should not be limited to a one-off inspection. If the accused person or his lawyer deems it necessary, further access should be granted. If a file is particularly voluminous or where the interests of justice so require it, the accused person should be provided with an index of the documents contained in the case-file to enable him to decide to which documents he wishes to be given access. Verification and remedies : in order to ensure that a suspected or accused person receives all the information to which he is entitled, Member States should establish a procedure to ascertain whether the person has received the information. This can be a form for the person to sign confirming that he has received the information or a note in the custody record. Training: Member States' police officers, prosecutors and judges should receive the necessary training to discharge adequately their duties arising from the directive. In particular, it is imperative that these officials have the requisite detailed knowledge of the procedural rights of suspected and accused persons in order to provide relevant and practically effective information on these rights. Non-regression clause : the aim is to ensure that setting common minimum standards in accordance with the Directive does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the standards set in the ECHR are maintained. Member States remain entirely free to set standards higher than those agreed in the Directive. Report: this must be submitted by the Commission 36 months after publication of the Directive. Annex I: this Annex contains an indicative model of the Letter of Rights to be provided to a suspected or accused person on arrest. The model Letter of Rights sets out an explanation in simple language of the immediately relevant minimum rights as listed in the Directive. Whilst there is no obligation on Member States to use the model, those that do will be presumed to have implemented the relevant article 4 of the Directive. Annex II: this Annex contains an indicative model of the Letter of Rights to be provided to a person arrested on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant. Whilst there is no obligation on Member States to use the model, those that do will be presumed to have implemented the relevant article of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the deepening of the financial crisis in some of the Member States is undoubtedly affecting substantially the real economy due to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by the Governments to borrow money from the market. In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of rural development programmes is of particular importance as a tool for providing financial assistance to the real economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non EURO countries or from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the EURO countries. To date, six countries have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme. Hungary has received financial assistance from 2009 but has exited the support mechanism in 2010. The remaining five countries are Romania and Latvia under the BoP and Portugal, Greece, and Ireland under the EFSM. In order to help these Member States to continue the implementation of the programmes on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains provisions that allow the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the rural development programmes of these MS to be increased. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal will allow the Commission to approve higher EAFRD contribution rates for the countries concerned, for as long as they are under the support mechanisms. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed to amend Council Regulation 1698/2005 in order to allow the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the rural development programmes of the Member States concerned to be increased up to: 95% of eligible public expenditure in the regions eligible under the Convergence objective, the outermost regions and the smaller Aegean Islands; 85% of eligible public expenditure in other regions, for as long as they are under the support mechanisms. This will be a temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits the support mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of EAFRD financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. On the basis of the forecasts of expenditure sent to the Commission to date by the Member States concerned, an additional EUR 90 million from the 2011 budget if the proposal is approved in time, and EUR 470 million from the 2012 budget might be necessary to be paid out in case the Member States decide to use the maximum co-finance rate allowed. The Commission will in 2012 review the need for additional payment appropriations and if necessary propose the relevant actions to the Budgetary Authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Iceland is a candidate country for EU membership since the European Council of 17 June 2010 noted that Iceland meets the political criteria set by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 and decided to open negotiations with Iceland. Similarly, the European Council of 16-17 December 2010 agreed to give Montenegro the status of candidate country. In addition, the Council has invited the Commission to propose an amendment to Article 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 with a view to clarifying the rules regarding the participation in the award of grant contracts financed under the IPA Cross-Border Cooperation component and ensuring coherence with other external aid instruments and in particular with the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Lastly, Council Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 establishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community designates the committee provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 (the ""Phare committee"") to assist the Commission in the management of the assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community. In accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006, Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 has been repealed. However it continues to apply for legal acts and commitments implementing the budget years preceding 2007. As Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 continues to be the basic act for financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community beyond these budget years, the Phare committee should also be continued for that purpose. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes three amendments to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). Iceland and Montenegro will be transferred from the list of potential candidate countries (Annex II) to the list of candidate countries (Annex I), following the decisions of the European Council. The Commission proposes to the Council and the Parliament an amendment to Article 19 ""Rules of participation and origin, eligibility for grants"" of the IPA Regulation in order to align its provisions with those of Article 21 ""Participation in tenders and contracts"" of the ENPI Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006. This amendment addresses the concern, expressed by EU Member States involved in IPA cross–border cooperation (CBC) programmes, with regard to the participation in calls for proposals. Member States asked for participation in calls for proposals to be limited to applicants from countries participating in the relevant IPA CBC programme, as is already the case for the ENPI CBC programmes. The Council invited the Commission to propose a possible solution at the earliest opportunity. The Commission proposes that Article 19 should be aligned with Article 21 of the ENPI Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006 by inserting a new paragraph which, considering the local nature of the CBC programmes, would allow participation in calls for proposals to be limited to local actors. The Commission proposes to amend the IPA Regulation with the aim of allowing the Phare committee to continue to assist the Commission in the management of the financial assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 on assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Council Directive 2001/112/EC lays down rules governing the composition, use of reserved descriptions, manufacturing specifications and labelling of the products concerned, in order to ensure their free movement within the European Union. This amendment of the directive, which amends Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, is based on revised international standards, in particular the Codex Alimentarius for fruit juices and nectars (Codex Stan 247-2005) and the Code of Practice of the European Fruit Juice Association (AIJN). This draft directive, which is technical in nature, reaffirms the distinction between fruit juice and fruit juice from concentrate, simplifies the provisions on the restitution of flavour and aroma, provides for the removal of sugar from the list of authorised ingredients and includes tomatoes in the list of fruits used for fruit juice production. This proposed directive will take account, as of now, of the redefinition of the competences of the Commission (Articles 290/291 of the Treaty). Consequently, it will amend the current directive by including all implementing measures in the category of delegated acts.

BACKGROUND: phosphates are used in detergents to combat water hardness in order to allow efficient cleaning. Phosphates from detergents can contribute to certain adverse effects in the aquatic environment. The prime concern is that they can lead to an excess of nutrients which cause an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms, a phenomenon called eutrophication. Nevertheless, in view of concerns about eutrophication, the Commission presented the report in 2007 and concluded that the state of knowledge concerning the contribution of phosphates in detergents to eutrophication was still incomplete, but was developing rapidly. Further scientific work conducted thereafter, as well as information on economic and social impacts of possible restrictions, have been the basis for an impact assessment report, which analyses a number of policy options to address the use of phosphates in detergents IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the analysis of the impacts of the various policy options has been conducted taking into consideration results of the scientific analysis of the contribution of phosphates in detergents to eutrophication risks in the EU, as well as the criteria of effectiveness and efficiency (including practicality, socio-economic impacts, and monitorability). Five policy options have been scrutinised for their impact: Option 1: No action at EU level, leaving the responsibility to act to the Member States or in the context of regional cooperation (baseline option); Option 2: Voluntary action by industry; Option 3: Total ban of phosphates in detergents; Option 4: Restriction/limitation of phosphates content in laundry detergents; Option 5: Setting limits values for the content of phosphates in detergents. The evaluation and the impact analysis of the options shows that the introduction at European level of a limitation on the use of phosphates and other phosphorous compounds in household laundry detergents (option 4) will reduce the contribution of phosphates from detergents to eutrophication risks of EU waters and reduce the cost of phosphorous removal for waste water treatment plants. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to extend the scope of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 to allow introduction of a limitation on the content of phosphates and others phosphorous compounds in household laundry detergents, in order to decrease detergents' contribution to the overall eutrophication of EU surface waters, following the conclusions of the evaluations and the impact assessment performed by the Commission pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004. The draft Regulation, therefore, establishes an overall limit of 0.5 % by weight for the content of phosphorous in household laundry detergents, covering all phosphates and phosphorous containing compounds. For the time being, until technically and economically viable alternatives to phosphates become available for other types of detergent, the proposal limits the content of phosphates and other phosphorous compounds only in household laundry detergents. For household automatic dishwasher detergent containing phosphates, it is proposed that the Commission is tasked to review their contribution to the eutrophication risk within 5 years after the adoption of the proposed act, to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council (amendment of Article 16) and if deemed appropriate, to propose restrictions concerning their phosphates content by adapting the new Annex VIa to technical progress. The proposal also adapts the current provisions of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Finally, the proposed act maintains the already existing provision allowing Member States to lay down national rules to limit the content of phosphates and other phosphorous compounds in detergents other than household laundry detergents, if justified on environmental grounds. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: on the basis of a mandate from the Council, the Commission has conducted negotiations with Morocco on the renewal for one year of the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Morocco, which expired on 27 February 2011. A Protocol renewing the preceding Protocol was initialled on 25 February 2011. It is now appropriate to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The Commission’s negotiating position was based in part on the results of an ex-post and ex-ante evaluation carried out by independent experts, as well as on a joint assessment of the scientific data on the state of stocks. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) in conjunction with Article 218(6a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal aims to extend, for the period of one year, the protocol to the fisheries partnership agreement between the EC and Morocco of 22 May 2006. The general aim is to continue the cooperation between the European Union and Morocco, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Moroccan fishing zones, in the interests of both Parties. The main objective of the Protocol is to define the fishing opportunities offered to EU vessels based on the surplus available, as well as the financial contribution due, separately, for access rights and for sectoral support. The main provisions may be summarised as follows : Financial contribution : the overall annual contribution of EUR 36 100 000 under the Protocol is based on: a maximum of 119 fishing permits for EU vessels in the categories of small-scale fishing, demersal fishing and tuna fishing, as well as a maximum catch tonnage of 60 000 tonnes in the category of industrial pelagic fishing, and EUR 13 500 000 in development aid for Morocco's sectoral fisheries policy. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy. Fishing opportunities : the Protocol – like its predecessor – provides for fishing opportunities in the following six categories: small-scale pelagic fishing in the north: 20 seiners; small-scale fishing in the north: 30 bottom longliners; small-scale fishing in the south: 20 vessels; demersal fishing: 22 vessels; tuna fishing: 27 vessels; industrial pelagic fishing: 60 000 tonnes of catches. Duration of the agreement : the Protocol will be valid from 28 February 2011 to 27 February 2012. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial envelope for the Protocol is EUR 36.15 million for the extended year (including credits of an administrative nature financed by certain operational programmes.) A total of EUR 142.000 is provided for administrative expenditure. The total amounts to EUR 36.292 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents is enshrined in Article 255 of the Treaty, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Provisions for this right have been set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. In 2004, following an in-depth review of the Regulation, the Commission concluded that it was working well and as result considered it inappropriate to amend the Regulation in the short term. A number of recent initiatives have, however, required the Commission to reassess its position. Firstly, the “European Transparency Initiative” (a review of the Regulation), secondly the adoption of a Parliamentary Resolution in April 2006 which asked the Commission to come forward with proposals for amending the Regulation; and thirdly the adoption of the Arhus Convention concerning access to documents containing environmental information and its interaction with Regulation (EC) No 1049. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to amend Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on the basis of the review process. In short, the Commission proposes the following: Purpose and beneficiaries: the wording in Article 1 (a) has been slightly modified to clarify the purpose of the Regulation and to grant public access to documents. The right of access will be granted to any natural or legal person, regardless of nationality or State of residence – this approach is consistent with the Arhus Regulation. Scope and definitions: the proposal specifies that the Regulation will apply to all documents held by an institution concerning a matter relating to the policies, activities and decisions falling within its sphere of responsibility. In addition a new paragraph has been added clarifying that documents submitted to Courts by parties other than the institutions do not fall within the scope of the Regulation (the recall, the TEU excludes the Court of Justice from the right of access to documents). Access to documents relating to the exercise of investigative powers will also be excluded until the relevant decision can no longer be challenged by an action for annulment or the investigation is closed. During this investigation phase, only the specific rules relating to this field will apply. Thus, information obtained from natural or legal persons in the course of such investigations should continue to be protected after the relevant decision has become definitive. The wide definition of a “document” is maintained. Exceptions: in order to align the proposed amendments with the Arhus Regulation, the Commission proposes that the exception seeking to protect the environment (Article 6(2) of the Arhus Regulation) is added to the Regulation on public access to documents. The proposal also states that the exception seeking to protect commercial interests will not apply to information on emissions. A separate mention is, therefore, made on intellectual property rights. At the same time the Commission has decided to include a new exception aimed at protecting procedures leading to the selection of staff or of contracting parties. Consultation with Third Parties: a new Article has been introduced that lays down the procedure to be followed where access is requested for documents originating from a Member State. The Member State must be consulted unless it is clear that the documents shall or shall not be disclosed. In cases where the Member State gives reasons for not disclosing the requested documents – or on relevant similar and specific rules in its national legislation, the institution will deny access to these documents. Procedural rules: the Commission proposes to extend the time limit for handling a confirmatory application to thirty working days, with a possibility for a further extension by 15 working days. Experience shows that it is almost impossible to handle a confirmatory application within 15 working days. A new paragraph has been added to Article 10 clarifying that, where specific modalities for access are laid in EU or national law, these must be respected. Active Dissemination : provisions relating to active dissemination have been redrafted in order to grant direct access to documents, which are part of procedures leading to the adoption of EU legislative acts or non-legislative acts of general application. Such documents should be made accessible by the institutions from the outset, unless an exception to the public right access clearly applies."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: following the accident of the oil tanker ""Erika"" and the major oil pollution caused by this accident, the Commission set up the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) as a technical body with the aim to ensure a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships in the EU. Today, EMSA provides Member States and the Commission with technical and scientific assistance in order to help Member States to apply properly the Community legislation in the field of maritime safety, maritime security and prevention of pollution by ships, to monitor the implementation of this legislation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in place and assist in the development of new measures. The previous modifications made to regulation 1406/2002 have not been sufficient to address the new challenges ahead for EMSA, most of the challenges being external either to EMSA only or to EMSA and the EU as a whole. Based on the findings of the external evaluation, the recommendations by the Administrative Board and the multi-annual strategy, some provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 should be clarified and updated. Furthermore, the Agency should receive a number of additional tasks reflecting the development of the maritime safety policy at EU and international level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment report and the summary are attached to the proposal. The Impact Assessment Board issued its opinion on 22 June 2008 providing a number of recommendations for improvements of the draft report, which have been incorporated in the final version. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which has served as legal basis for Regulation 1406/2002. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to maintain EMSA's current tasks and institutional structure, ensuring continuity for the Agency’s activities which provide added value at EU-level and are well appreciated by the stakeholders. The proposal for a limited extension of EMSA's tasks reflects new needs. EMSA’s updated mandate would: clarify that the Stand-by Oil Spill Response Vessels under contract by EMSA can intervene also in case of oil pollution caused by offshore installations; increase EMSA's involvement in EU research (analysis of research projects and identification of research priorities); extend EMSA's technical assistance to all European Neighbourhood Policy countries in order to promote the EU maritime safety policy in all the regional seas bordering the EU; emphasise the role of EMSA's operational vessel traffic monitoring services as basis for extended transport and maritime information services, including in the context of the development of a Common Information Sharing Environment for the EU maritime domain; extend EMSA’s assistance in the development and implementation of EU policies, such as Motorways of the Sea, e-maritime as well as environmental aspects of shipping including climate change. Following an invitation by the European Parliament and the Council , the Commission services are working on a feasibility study regarding a European Coastguard service. The Commission services have concluded so far that synergies at EU level regarding certain coastguard operations could be reinforced through EMSA's activities. This could be further supported by extending EMSA's tasks in selected areas, in particular regarding the monitoring of maritime traffic and shipping routes as well as assistance to Member States in the tracking of possible polluters. Lastly, as regards the organisation of inspections by the Agency on behalf of the Commission, the roles of the Agency, the Commission, the Administrative Board and the Member States need to be clarified. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has a modest budgetary implication insofar as the Agency receives a limited number of new or extended tasks, for which EMSA would need 18 posts to ensure effective and efficient operation. However, in the light of the current budgetary situation, the Commission has agreed with the Agency a considerable redeployment effort, as a result of which 6 of these posts will be provided by EMSA itself through internal redeployment. This means that the Budgetary authority would need to decide in the forthcoming annual budgetary procedures only on a total of 12 additional posts for the Agency's establishment plan to be phased in between 2012 and 2014 (5 posts in 2012, 4 posts in 2013 and 3 posts in 2014). The budgetary impact of this proposal is thus limited to a total of approximatively EUR 3.9 million for the period 2012-2015."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 became applicable on 5 April 2010. In accordance with Article 51 of the Visa Code operational instructions on the practical application of the provisions of the Regulation have been drawn up by the Commission Decision establishing the Handbook for the processing of visa applications and the modification of issued visas adopted on 19 March 2010. During the preparation of the Handbook, it has been observed that the formulation of Article 3 (5) (b) and (c) relating to the exemption from airport transit visa (ATV) requirements was unclear. As the Handbook cannot create legally binding obligations on Member States, it is necessary to amend the Visa Code to establish legal certainty and a harmonised application of the rules. Such clarification is of practical importance for individual travellers and for airline companies. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the two aspects covered by the proposal have been discussed in the Visa Committee and in the Visa Working Party and Member States have supported the Commission taking the initiative for a limited amendment of the Visa Code. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77 (2) (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: according to Regulation (EC) No 810/2009, third country nationals subject to the airport transit visa requirement who hold a valid visa issued by a Member State, Canada, Japan or the United States of America or who hold a valid residence permit issued by a Member State, Andorra, Canada, Japan, San Marino or the United States of America are exempted from the ATV requirement. This proposal is restricted to a technical amendment involving the clarification of the existing text with a view to specifying that: third country nationals holding a valid visa or residence permit issued by a Member State not applying the common visa policy in full are to be covered by the ATV exemption; the ATV exemption covers the persons holding a valid visa when they travel to the third country that issued the visa, to any other third country, and when having used the visa they return from the third country that issued the visa.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU’s economic well-being relies on sustained creativity and innovation. Accordingly, the Europe 2020 Strategy  highlights the need to strengthen the EU’s research performance, to promote innovation throughout the Member States, ensuring that innovative ideas can be turned into new products and services that create growth and quality jobs. Intellectual property rights (IPR) are vital business assets, which help to ensure that innovators and creators get a fair return for their work and investments. Over the last ten years, however, IPR infringements have increased significantly. In 2009, the OECD estimated that international trade in counterfeit and pirated goods accounted for USD 250 billion in 2007, which is larger than the national GDPs of 150 economies. Also, figures published by EU customs authorities reflect a clear increase in customs activity, with a rise in registered cases from 26 704 in 2005 to 43 572 in 2009, i.e. up by about 60 % in five years. One of the main initiatives to address this threat launched by the Council and the Commission in 2009 was to set up a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy to improve understanding on intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements ('the Observatory'). In line with the Council's request of 2008, the Observatory in its current form is a centre of expertise with no legal personality managed by the Commission services. The latest Council Resolution relating to the Observatory added further responsibilities, by inviting it to assess the needs for implementation of EU-level training programmes for those involved in combating counterfeiting and piracy. A September 2010 European Parliament Resolution additionally called for the Observatory to compile scientific research data on counterfeiting and IPR regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 and 118(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment looked at three different options, each with a number of sub-options: Option 1: the Observatory continues to be administered by DG MARKT, but with extra resources: Sub-option 1a – DG MARKT’s human and budgetary resources are increased. Sub-option 1b – The management of the Observatory is outsourced to an external contractor. Option 2: tasks are performed by a private body or jointly under a public-private partnership: Sub-option 2a – Industry-led initiative, financed by private sector stakeholders. Sub-option 2b – Industry-led initiative, financed by a Commission grant/programme. Sub-option 2c – Public-private partnership (PPP). Option 3: the Observatory is entrusted to an EU agency: Sub-option 3a – The tasks of the Observatory are entrusted to a newly created EU agency. Sub-option 3b – The tasks of the Observatory are entrusted to an existing agency. In budgetary terms it would offer a cost-efficient solution (with total costs of between EUR 3.3 million and 4.3 million in the first two years and between EUR 4.74 million and 5.52 million as of year three) and allow costs to be covered by financial resources outside of the EU budget. The Commission concludes that Option 3b (entrusting the tasks to an existing EU agency, preferably OHIM) is the preferred option. It would allow the Observatory to have access to expertise, resources and financing and to become quickly operational. In budgetary terms it would offer a cost-efficient solution and allow costs to be covered by financial resources outside of the EU budget. CONTENT: over the last two years, the Observatory's institutional framework has been set up. This setting up phase of the Observatory having been concluded it shows that, due to a lack of funding, human resources, IT and meeting capacities and necessary expertise, with its current infrastructure it will not be able to meet its objectives in the future and that the taking on of additional tasks under the current setting would be excluded. It is proposed to entrust the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market with the tasks and activities relating to the management of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, including those concerning copyright, rights related to copyright and patents. The specific objectives are: to make public authorities and private stakeholders more aware of counterfeiting and piracy as regards their scope, impact and trends, and effective techniques to combat the problem and to improve day-to-day cooperation; to inform consumers of the economic impact and dangers related to counterfeiting and piracy and to help them avoid being misled into buying fake products; to improve the coordination of actions directed towards third countries. The operational objectives are to ensure that the Observatory has the necessary infrastructure (in terms of human resources, funding, IT and meeting capacities, expertise and independence from vested interests) to perform its tasks effectively, as quickly as possible and at minimum cost to the EU budget. These objectives dovetail with existing EU policies and strategies, such as Europe 2020. They also fit in with the Commission’s main priorities and proposals concerning its IPR strategy for Europe. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not create any costs for the EU budget. Instead, it would allow for savings of around EUR 40 000 as certain costs that are currently borne by the EU budget would in future be borne by the OHIM’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Competitiveness Council Conclusions of 25 May 2010 confirmed that improving access to up-to-date and trustworthy information on companies could encourage greater confidence in the market, help recovery and increase the competitiveness of European business. Business registers play an essential role in this regard. Cross-border access to business information requires the cross-border cooperation among business registers. The High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens was fully in support of achieving interoperability between trade registers throughout Europe. The interconnection of business registers is one of the proposals in the Communication on the Single Market Act that aim to create a more business-friendly legal and fiscal environment and can also contribute to the agenda Europe 2020 by improving confidence in the single market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the issues around the interconnection of business registers were grouped in three sections: lack of up-to-date business information in the register of foreign branches : the impact assessment concludes that EU legislation should lay down a legal requirement for registers to cooperate by electronic means with regard to updating the registration of foreign branches and the Commission should determine the technical details of such cooperation in a delegated act. difficulties of cooperation between registers in cross-border merger and seat transfer procedures : EU legislation should delegate powers to the Commission to determine the technical details in cross-border merger and seat transfer procedures in a delegated act; difficult cross-border access to business information : in this respect, the best option to: (i) improve the existing situation would be for EU law to lay down a requirement for Member States to participate in an electronic network of registers; (ii) determine the list of information to be transmitted through the network; (iii) determine the frequency of updating the registered information and that the Commission should determine the technical details of the cooperation in a delegated act. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50(2)(g) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the amendments proposed to Directives 89/666/EEC, 2005/56/EC and 2009/101/EC aim to: facilitate cross-border access to official business information by setting up an electronic network of registers and determining a common minimum set of up-to-date information to be made available to third parties by electronic means in every Member State; ensure that the business register of a company provides up-to-date information on the status of the company to the business register of foreign branches all across Europe; improve a cooperation framework between business registers in cross-border merger procedures. More specifically, the proposal aims to makes sure that the documents and particulars in the Member States' business registers are always up to date. They have to make sure that the registered data is updated within 15 calendar days after the underlying change occurs. In order to comply with this requirement, Member States have to ensure that the companies file the relevant changes on time and the change is registered without delay; introduce a unique identifier for all European limited-liability companies that would facilitate their identification at the European level and would allow for easier identification between companies and their foreign branches. Such an identifier could also be used by other registers identifying, for example, listed companies, financial institutions or multinational groups; improve cross-border access to a common minimum set of registered business information by requiring Member States to make the documents and particulars listed in the proposed Directive and registered under the Directive's requirements available through a single European electronic platform, e.g. a central web-service that allows search in all EU business registers. This proposal is complementary to the e-Justice project and should contribute to easier access to business information through the portal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications on the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

Two years after the launch of the SEPA credit transfer, the number of SEPA credit transfers processed by clearing and settlement mechanisms located in the euro area has not yet reached the 10% threshold. A linear extrapolation of the current SCT migration rate of 9.3% (as of August 2010), suggests that it will take around 30 years to complete SEPA. Even in a more optimistic scenario, it seems very unlikely that SEPA migration will be completed in less than 15–20 years without additional legislative intervention. Although strongly supported by both the European Commission and the European Central Bank, SEPA was originally conceived as a primarily market-driven project. Union-wide schemes for credit transfers and direct debits were designed and implemented by the European Payments Council (EPC), a coordination and decision making body set up by the European banking sector to deliver SEPA. However, given the current slow rates of migration, there is increasing recognition by all categories of stakeholders that a legally binding end-date may be necessary to achieve successful project completion. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment, prepared in close cooperation with the ECB, considers three scenarios: no intervention, additional incentives for SEPA migration without setting an end-date and the impacts of setting a migration end-date. It concludes that the best scenario for the Union payments market, the European economy and the stakeholders is setting an end-date for migration by way of a Regulation. Subsequently, the impact assessment considers the best ways of implementing the end-date at the technical level, by discussing policy sub-options for the end-date implementation in several areas: i) the reference basis for adopting Union-wide credit transfers and direct debits: ii) the transaction domain; iii) product specification; iv) Member States scope; v) deadline for migration, and vi) clarity on the long term business model for pan-European direct debits. LEGAL BASE: Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for setting technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits is aimed at: setting up separate migration end-dates for credit transfers and direct debits respectively , by introducing a set of common standards and general technical requirements; ensuring reachability of payment service providers for credit transfer transactions , along the lines of the reachability obligation for direct debit transactions under Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 and interoperability of payment systems. The main features of the regulation are as follows: Purpose and scope : the proposal covers the execution of all credit transfer and direct debit transactions denominated in euros within the Union. It does not cover some types of payment transactions -such as payment card transactions, money remittance and payment transactions through means of any telecommunication, digital or IT device which do not result in a credit transfer or direct debit. To promote competition and efficiency, the Regulation should not foreclose from the market non-'traditional' payment schemes, in particular when they are based on combined schemes rules including a direct debit or credit transfer segment. Hence, the provisions of this Regulation only apply to the credit transfer or direct debit underlying the transaction. Definitions: these are aligned, as much as possible, with those used in Directive 2007/64/EC. However, given the Regulation’s limited scope in comparison with the Payment Services Directive, some of the definitions have been tailored to the needs of this proposal. Reachability of payment service providers for credit transfer transactions is integrated with the reachability obligation for direct debit transactions under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009. Technical interoperability : the proposal contains provisions which are necessary for the smooth functioning of payment schemes and systems, so that they can interact with each other across the Union using the same standards, without technical obstacles to the processing of payments by the market players. Technical requirements for credit transfer and direct debit transactions : the text introduces deadlines for migration to Union-wide instruments, by making certain important standards used by the payment industry mandatory and defining technical requirements applying to both payment service providers and customers. No later than 12 months after the entry into force of the Regulation, credit transfers shall be carried out in accordance with the technical requirements set out in the Annex. The deadline for direct debit transactions is set at 24 months after the entry into force of the Regulation. Interchange fees for direct debit transactions: the proposal clarifies that, after 31 October 2012, multilateral interchange fees (MIFs) per transaction are not allowed for national and cross-border direct debits. It also defines general conditions for interchange fees (multilateral, bilateral and unilateral) for R-transactions, in line with the working document on the 'Applicability of Article 81 of the EC Treaty to multilateral interbank-payments in SDD' published by the Commission on 3 November 2009. Waiver: this provision applies to so-called 'legacy' niche products which should also be phased out after an appropriate transitional period. Payment accessibility : the proposal ensures that if a euro credit transfer or a euro direct debit is accepted domestically, it will also be used to and from a euro account on a cross-border basis. Competent authorities : the competent authorities would be empowered to take necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in this Regulation. Penalties : Member States are required to provide details of penalties to the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: leaving aside the normal administrative costs linked to ensuring the respect of EU legislation, there will be no budgetary impact since no new committees are created and no financial commitments are made. However, the Commission is also a significant user of payment services in its own right and therefore should benefit, along with other users, from enhanced competition generated by SEPA."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the milk sector went through a deep crisis due to a shift in demand away from dairy products following exceptionally high prices in 2007. The crisis also showed some shortcomings in the market orientation of the milk sector. The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development therefore decided to create a High Level Experts' Group on Milk (HLG) to work on a regulatory framework to be put in place for the medium and long term, which can contribute to stabilising the market and producers' income and enhance transparency. The report and recommendations issued by the HLG were examined by the Council and Presidency conclusions were adopted at the meeting of 27 September 2010. Those conclusions urge the Commission to submit by the end of the year its response to the first three recommendations of the HLG (contractual relations, bargaining power of producers and inter-branch organisations) and to rapidly respond to the HLG recommendation on transparency. One of the key aspects of HLG's work focussed on areas which relate to the structure of the market and the actors in it: contractual relations, bargaining power, producer organisations and inter-branch organisations. According to the HLG, the current market structure significantly worsened aspects of the 2009 milk crisis. The existence for a long period of fixed quotas and high institutional prices, with, in effect, guaranteed outlets for dairy commodities created rigidities in the market. Structural adaptation was often inhibited, actors in the production chain were not stimulated to respond to market signals, including price movements, and there were reduced incentives for innovation or productivity gains. The market structure is very different between and within Member States, but often concentration of supply is much lower than concentration at processing level. This results in an imbalance in bargaining power between these levels. There are also rigidities in the market, with farmers having little choice of dairy (or even of transporters for raw milk). These factors can lead to a serious lack of adaptation of supply to demand and unfair commercial practices. In particular farmers often do not know what price they will receive for their milk when delivering (which is often fixed much later by dairies on a basis wholly out of the farmer's control). The distribution of the added value in the chain is not balanced, especially with regard to farmers, and there is a significant problem of price transmission along the chain. A key problem seems to be between the farmers and the processors and solutions to remedy the situation would focus at this level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: the first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the present proposal addresses all 4 elements: contractual relations, bargaining power of producers, inter-branch organisations and transparency to the extent that they need an amendment to present provisions. The proposal provides for optional written contracts between milk producers and processors to be drawn up in advance of deliveries, which should include details of price, timing and volume of deliveries, and duration. Member States can make the use of contracts compulsory in their territory. Cooperatives, in order to take into account their specific nature, are not required to have contracts if their statutes include elements with similar effects. In order to rebalance bargaining power in the supply chain, the proposal foresees allowing farmers to negotiate contracts collectively through producer organisations. Appropriate quantitative limits to the volume of this negotiation will put farmers on equal footing with the major dairies while maintaining an adequate competition in the raw milk supply. The limits are set at 3.5% of global EU production and 33% of national production, with specific safeguards also provided to avoid serious prejudice in particular to SMEs. The proposal provides also specific EU rules for inter-branch organisations (IPOs) covering all parts of the chain. They can potentially play useful roles in research, improvement of quality, promotion and spreading of best practice in production and processing methods. They would contribute to improving knowledge and the transparency of production and the market. It is proposed to apply the rules on the objectives of IPOs in the fruit and vegetables sector to the dairy sector, with appropriate adaptations, so that hardcore restraints of competition (including price fixing and market partitioning) remain excluded and the agreements concerned are submitted to Commission approval. Again with the purpose of improving knowledge of production and following of developments in the market, it is necessary for the Commission to obtain regular information on volumes of raw milk delivered. In order to further enhance transparency, joint meetings of the experts of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets together with the Advisory Group on Milk will be organised to assess the market situation and prospects, the objective being to increase awareness as well as reinforce the responsibility of operators in the dairy chain to better take into account market signals and adapt supply to demand. Lastly, these measures are proposed to remain valid until 2020, with a review in 2014 and 2018. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed measures which can contribute to stabilize the market and producers' income for the medium and long term have no direct impact on the EU Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: events in 2007 and 2008 showed that the existing, fragmented DGS system has not delivered on the objectives set by Directive 94/19/EC on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS), in terms of maintaining depositors’ confidence and financial stability in times of economic stress. The current about 40 DGS in the EU, which cover different groups of depositors and deposits up to different coverage levels, impose different financial obligations on banks and therefore limit the benefits of the internal market for banks and depositors. Moreover, schemes have proved to be underfinanced in times of financial stress. Directive 2009/14/EC was adopted as an emergency measure to maintain depositors’ confidence, in particular by increasing the coverage level from EUR 20 000 to EUR 100 000 by the end of 2010. Directive 2009/14/EC contained a clause providing for a broad review of all aspects of DGSs. The need to reinforce DGSs by presenting appropriate legislative proposals was reiterated in the Commission communication of 4 March 2009 Driving European recovery . This proposal is part of a package on guarantee schemes in the financial sector, which also comprises a review of investor compensation schemes (Directive 97/9/EC) and a White Paper on insurance guarantee schemes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: altogether, over 70 different policy options were assessed. The main options identified as preferable are: (a) simplifying and harmonising the scope of coverage; (b) reducing the payout deadline to seven days; (c) ending the practice of setting off depositors’ liabilities against their claims; (d) introducing an information template to be countersigned by a depositor and a mandatory reference to DGSs in account statements and advertisements; (e) harmonising the approach to the funding of DGSs; (f) setting a target level for DGS funds; (g) fixing the proportions of ex-ante and ex-post bank contributions to DGS; (i) introducing risk-based elements for bank contributions to DGS; (j) restricting the use of DGS funds for broader bank resolution purposes benefiting of all creditors of a bank; (k) having the host country DGS act as a single point of contact for depositors at branches in another Member State. In terms of social impact, the proposal provides that, in the event of a bank failure, depositors are reimbursed up to EUR 100 000 by a DGS within seven calendar days. This will make the intervention of social welfare systems almost unnecessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 53(1) TFEU. CONTENT: the main elements of this proposal are: simplification and harmonisation, in particular as to the scope of coverage and the arrangements for payout; further reduction of the time limit for paying out depositors and better access for DGS to information about their members (i.e. banks); sound and credible DGSs that are sufficiently financed; mutual borrowing between DGSs, i.e. a borrowing facility in certain circumstances. The elements of the review which, in the Commission’s view, should not be subject to legislation are set out in the report accompanying this proposal (please see COM(2010)0369). The report and the proposal are part of a package on guarantee schemes in the financial sector, which also comprises a review of investor compensation schemes (see COD/2010/0199) and a White Paper on insurance guarantee schemes. The main points are as follows: Scope: the Directive now encompasses all credit institutions and all schemes, without distinction. All banks must join a DGS. This ensures that depositors always have a claim against a scheme and that all schemes must be soundly financed. Mutual guarantee schemes protect depositors by protecting the credit institution itself. Since all banks must now join a DGS, mutual guarantee schemes can either be recognised as DGSs and meet the requirements set out in Directive 2006/48/EC, or be set up separately. In this case, a dual membership of a bank in both schemes and the additional safeguard role of mutual schemes can be taken into account when the contributions to the DGS are set. Definitions: deposits are now defined more clearly. Only entirely repayable instruments can be deemed deposits, not structured products, certificates or bonds. This prevents DGSs from taking unpredictable risks with investment products. Supervision: all DGSs must now be supervised on a continual basis and they must perform regular stress tests of their systems. DGSs now have the right to obtain information from banks at an early stage in order to enable fast payout. Member States are now explicitly allowed to merge their DGSs. Credit institutions now have to be given one month’s notice, not 12 months’, before they can be excluded from a DGS. Eligibility criteria and determination of the repayable amount : depositors’ eligibility has been simplified and harmonised. Most discretionary exclusions have become mandatory, in particular the exclusion of authorities and financial institutions of any kind. On the other hand, deposits in non-EU currencies are covered under the law and so are the deposits of all non-financial companies. The coverage level of EUR 100 000 (to be implemented by end of 2010 under Directive 2009/14/EC) has not been amended. However, Member States may decide to cover deposits arising from real estate transactions and deposits relating to particular life events above the limit of EUR 100 000 , provided that the coverage is limited to 12 months. It is now stipulated that interest due but not credited at the time of failure must be repaid, provided that the coverage level is not exceeded. Depositors must now be paid out in the currency in which the account was managed. Setting off claims against the depositor’s liabilities is no longer permitted after an institution fails. Payout: the DGS must now act to repay depositors within one week. Depositors do not need to submit an application. Any information they are given must be in the official language(s) of the Member State where the deposit is located. The Directive now stipulates that depositors’ unacknowledged or unpaid claims against DGS can only be time-barred to the extent that the DGS’s claims in the liquidation proceedings are time-barred. In order to meet such a short payout deadline, the competent authorities are obliged to inform DGSs by default if a bank failure becomes likely. Moreover, DGSs and banks must exchange information on depositors, domestically and across borders, unfettered by confidentiality requirements. Credit institutions must also be in a position to provide the aggregated deposits of a depositor (‘single customer view’) at any time. DGS financing and borrowing between DGS : the Directive now ensures that DGSs’ available financial means are proportionate to their potential liabilities. These financial means are safeguarded against potential losses by restrictions on investment similar to those for electronic money institutions under Directive 2009/110/EC and UCITS under Directive 2009/64/EC, taking into account the need for lower risk and higher liquidity. The financing of DGS will be based on the following subsequent steps: step 1: in order to ensure sufficient funding, DGSs must have 1.5 % of eligible deposits on hand after a transition period of 10 years (this is referred to as the ‘target level’). If these financial means turn out to be insufficient in the event of a bank failure, the second and third steps below must be taken; step 2: banks must pay extraordinary (‘ex-post’) contributions of up to 0.5 % of eligible deposits if necessary. Consequently, ex-ante funds will account for 75 % of DGSs’ financing and ex-post contributions 25 %; step 3: a mutual borrowing facility allows a DGS in need to borrow from all other DGSs in the EU, which, altogether, must, if needed, lend to the DGS a maximum of 0.5 % of its eligible deposits in need on short notice, proportionate to the amount of eligible deposits in each country. The loan must be repaid within five years and new contributions to the DGS must be raised to reimburse the loan. To secure repayment, the lending DGSs have the right to subrogate into the claims of depositors against the failed credit institution and these claims will rank first in the liquidation procedure of the credit institution whose failure depleted the borrowing DGS; step 4 : as a last line of defence against taxpayers’ involvement, DGSs must have in place alternative funding arrangements, recalling that those arrangements must comply with the monetary financing prohibition laid down in Article 123 TFEU. This four-step mechanism will become fully operational only after 10 years. In order to adapt the target level to schemes’ potential liabilities, it will be recalibrated on the basis of covered deposits (i.e. taking into account the coverage level), but without diminishing the level of protection. DGS funds should principally be used for paying out depositors. This, however, does not prevent their use for bank resolution purposes in accordance with state aid rules. However, to avoid the depletion of funds for the benefit of a bank’s uninsured creditors, such use must be limited to the amount that would have been necessary to pay out covered deposits. Given that bank resolution and payout have different purposes, DGS funds should be ring-fenced already when the target level is build up, ensuring that the primary function of DGSs, i.e. deposit payout, is not impeded. Risk-based contributions to DGSs: contributions from credit institutions to DGSs must be calculated according to their risk profiles in a harmonised way. In principle, contributions consist of both non-risk and risk-based elements. The latter will be calculated on the basis of several indicators reflecting the risk profiles of each credit institution. The proposed indicators cover the key risk classes commonly used to evaluate the financial soundness of credit institutions: capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability and liquidity. The data necessary to compute those indicators are available under existing reporting obligations. Taking into account differences between banking sectors in Member States, the Directive ensures some flexibility by developing a set of core indicators (mandatory for all Member States) and another set of supplementary indicators (optional for Member States). The core indicators consist of commonly used criteria such as capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability and liquidity. Core indicators weigh 75 % and supplementary indicators 25 %. In general, the Directive requires that the total amount of contributions to be collected by DGS should first be determined in line with the target level for DGS funds; then the amount should be apportioned among DGS member banks according to their risk profiles. Consequently, the Directive provides incentives for sound risk management and discourages risky behaviour by clearly differentiating between the levels of contribution paid by the least and most risky banks (from 75 % to 200 % of the standard amount, respectively). As to the non-risk element, the contribution base is the amount of eligible deposits, as is currently the case in most Member States. However, over time, covered deposits (i.e. eligible deposits not exceeding the coverage level) will become the contribution base in all Member States as they better reflect the risk to which DGSs are exposed. A full harmonisation of the calculation of risk-based contributions should be achieved at a later stage. Cross-border cooperation: in order to facilitate the payout process in cross-border situations, the host country DGS acts as a single point of contact for depositors at branches in another Member State. This includes not only communication with depositors in that country (acting as a ‘post box’) but also paying out on behalf of the home country DGS (acting as a ‘paying agent’). Agreements between DGSs will facilitate this function. Schemes have to exchange relevant information with each other. Mutual agreements will facilitate this. Banks reorganising themselves in a way that causes their membership of one DGS to cease and entails membership in another DGS will be reimbursed their last contribution so that they can use these funds to pay the first contribution to the new DGS. Depositor information : before making a deposit, depositors must now countersign an information sheet based on the template set out in the proposal, which contains all relevant information about the coverage of the deposit by the responsible DGS. Existing depositors must be informed accordingly on the statements of account. Advertising on deposit products must be limited to a factual reference to coverage by the DGS, in order to avoid using the DGS as a marketing argument. The regular disclosure of specific information by DGSs (ex-ante funds, ex-post capacity, results of regular stress testing) ensures transparency and credibility, leading to enhanced financial stability with insignificant costs. New supervisory architecture : o n 23 September 2009, the Commission adopted proposals for Regulations establishing the European System of Financial Supervisors, including the creation of the three European supervisory authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board. T he new European Banking Authority should collect information on the amount of deposits, conduct peer review analyses, confirm whether a DGS can borrow from other DGSs, and settle disagreements between DGSs. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: Article 16 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Morocco, of the other part, which has been in force since 1 March 2000, provides that the Community and Morocco will gradually implement greater liberalisation of their reciprocal trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products. On 14 October 2005, the Council authorised the Commission to conduct negotiations within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Morocco, in view of the progress made by Morocco as regards the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan, adopted in July 2005, in order to achieve greater liberalisation of reciprocal trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process and in line with the principles of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the conclusions of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs (Luxembourg - May 2005). On 14 December 2009, the Commission concluded negotiations on behalf of the Union on an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with a view to amending the Association Agreement with Morocco, which now needs to be approved on behalf of the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: the first subparagraph of Article 207(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of the Exchange of Letters between the EU and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products, the replacement of Protocols 1, 2 and 3 and their Annexes and amendments to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Morocco, of the other part. The draft agreement is based on the conclusions of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on Agriculture in Venice of 27 November 2003 which provides that action should be taken with regard to the following areas: sanitary and phytosanitary measures, the approximation of technical standards, the harmonisation of legislation, and the protection of geographical indications. In order to implement the results of the negotiations concluded with Morocco, the Commission proposes to the Council that the following technical changes are made to the Association Agreement: the replacement of Protocols 1, 2 and 3 and their annexes, the repeal of Article 10, the amendment of the title of Chapter II, the amendment of Articles 7, 15 and 17 and the amendment of Article 18(1). The intention of both sides is that this Agreement should enter into force from 1 January 2011. Furthermore, to reinforce the existing cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary issues and issues relating to technical barriers to trade, specific provisions are added to Article 3 of Title II of the Protocol 1 of this Agreement. Regarding the protection of geographical indications and denominations of origin, the Parties have agreed to open negotiations no later than one year after the entry into force of this Agreement. The agreement also includes provisions to enable the EU to introduce safeguard measures in regard to the agricultural products, fish and fishery products, covered by the Association Agreement. The Council is requested to adopt the proposed decision after the approval of the European Parliament. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

BACKGROUND: at present, the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation zone includes the European Union, the EFTA States, the participants in the Barcelona Process and the Faroe Islands. The pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin is made up of a multiplicity of agreements, setting out, among other things, free trade provisions based on a network of identical rules of origin allowing for diagonal cumulation, among the countries of the zone. This cumulation zone is bound to grow in the future. Since the implementation of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation, the difficulties with the management of the current system of individual protocols have increased. Any amendment to a protocol applicable between two partner countries of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone implies identical amendments to each and every protocol applicable within the zone. The European Commission therefore launched the idea of basing the diagonal cumulation of origin on a single legal instrument in the form of a regional convention on preferential rules of origin to which the individual free trade agreements applicable between the countries of the zone would refer. It was only in 2007 that Ministers agreed agreed to start the drafting of a single convention on preferential rules of origin for the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area in order to replace the current network of protocols on rules of origin. They also decided to include the participants in the Stabilisation and Association Process in this cumulation zone. On 26 November 2009, The Commission now calls on the Council to approve the Convention in the name of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(4) first subparagraph in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal relates to the conclusion of the regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin in the name of the EU. This Convention lays down the provisions regarding the origin of goods traded in the context of the relevant free-trade agreements concluded between the following Contracting Parties: the 27 Member States of the European Union, the EFTA States (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein), the Faroe Islands the participants in the Barcelona Process (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Palestine), the participants in the Stabilization and Association Process (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia , as well as Kosovo, under UNSC Resolution 1244/99). Main provisions: the Convention defines the concept of originating products ` and the methods of administrative cooperation to be applied between partners. These provisions are set out in the Appendixes to the Convention. The Convention also allows for: a more effective management of the system of pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation; an easier procedure for the amendment of rules of origin; existing provisions which are not commion to all future contracting parties to be catered for; the possible future extension of the geographical scope of cumulation to neighbouring countries and territories. Joint Committee: the Convention establishes a Joint Committee which will be empowered to amend its provisions and to decide of any future accession. The provisions of the Convention may be amended to take account of economic realities by the Joint Committee acting by unanimity. It should be noted that one of the stated objectives of the Convention is to move towards the application of identical rules of origin for the purpose of cumulation of origin for goods traded between all Contracting Parties. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. CONTENT: the objective of the above-mentioned Agreement is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the Member States of the EU and Iceland and Norway by applying certain provisions of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between Member States of the European Union and the 2001 Protocol to Iceland and Norway. The Agreement was signed in 2003, but has not been concluded and has not entered into force. The purpose of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters is to encourage and modernise cooperation between judicial, police and customs authorities by supplementing the provisions and facilitating the application of the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and its 1978 Protocol, the 1990 Convention applying the Schengen Agreement and the Benelux Treaty of 1962. The convention is supplemented by a Protocol established by the Council which provides for supplementary measures such as requests for information on banking transactions in order to combat crime in general and organised crime in particular. Procedure : following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, the procedures to be followed for the conclusion of the Agreement are governed by Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Agreement was signed already 6 years ago and therefore it should now be concluded as soon as possible. It is for this reason that the Commission proposes to conclude the Agreement. It recommends that the Council, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, adopt a decision concluding the Agreement. It should be noted that in accordance with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it is provided that in the case of agreements covering fields to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, the Council shall adopt a decision concluding the agreement, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Territorial application : the UK and Ireland will take part in the adoption of the Decision. Denmark will not be bound by the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he significance of cross-border successions within the European Union has been highlighted in the impact assessment attached to the proposal. The diversity of both the rules under substantive law and the rules of international jurisdiction or of applicable law, the multitude of authorities to which international succession matters can be referred and the fragmentation of successions which can result from these divergent rules are obstacles to the free movement of persons in the Union. Today, such persons are therefore faced with considerable difficulties in asserting their rights with regard to an international succession. These divergent rules also prevent the full exercise of private property law, which, in accordance with the settled case law of the Court of Justice, forms an integral part of the fundamental rights which the Court ensures are respected. The adoption of a European instrument in the area of successions was already one of the priorities of the 1998 Vienna Action Plan. The Hague Programme calls for the presentation of an instrument covering all the issues involved: applicable law, jurisdiction and recognition, administrative measures (certificates of inheritance, registration of wills). Before this proposal was drawn up, a wide-ranging consultation exercise took place within the Member States, the other institutions and the public. The Commission was sent a “Study on international successions in the European Union”, which had been drawn up by the German Institute of Notaries in November 2002. Its Green Paper on successions and wills , which was published on 1 March 2005, elicited 60 or so replies and was followed by a public hearing on 30 November 2006. The contributions received confirm the need for a Community instrument in this area and support the adoption of a proposal covering, among other things, questions concerning applicable law, jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of decisions and the creation of a European Certificate of Succession. The adoption of such an instrument has received the support of the European Parliament. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options have been split into the following two different sets, in order to take account of the different options to be considered: 1) Definition of policy options that address problems caused by national legislative differences concerning successions with transnational elements (Policy Options A) No common EU level action Policy Option A.1: Status quo. EU legislative action Policy Option A.2: Harmonisation of jurisdiction rules and introduction of rules on automatic recognition and enforcement of judgments, other decisions and authentic acts/deeds. Policy Option A.3: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules. Policy Option A.4: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and introduction of a European Certificate of Heir and Executor / Administrator in transnational successions. Policy Option A.5: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and jurisdiction rules. Policy Option A.6: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and jurisdiction rules, and introduction of rules on automatic recognition and enforcement of judgments, other decisions and authentic acts/deeds (A.2 plus A.3). Policy Option A.7: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and jurisdiction rules, and introduction of rules on automatic recognition and enforcement of judgments, other decisions and authentic acts/deeds, and introduction of a Certificate of Heir and Executor /Administrator in transnational successions. Non-legislative action Policy Option A.8: Establishment of a database / knowledge management system on conflict of laws, jurisdiction rules and competent bodies. Policy Option A.9: EU wide information campaign on succession (legislation and existing /forthcoming instruments). 2) Definition of policy options that address problems of identifying wills abroad (Policy Options B) No common EU level action Policy Option B.1: Status quo EU level action (legislation and funding) Policy option B.2: Commission Recommendation on the establishment of interconnected national registers of wills and organisation of information campaigns. Policy option B.3 Compulsory establishment of interconnected national registers of wills. Policy option B.4 Establishment of a central EU Register of Wills. Non-legislative action Policy Option B.5: Creation of a webpage on existing registers of wills and national rules. Policy Option B.6: National information campaigns on wills (legislation and existing / forthcoming instruments). The preferred option is a combination of policy options A.7 and B.2 . A.7 is the preferred one as it would address most of the current problems and lead to the greatest cost reduction (maximum 30%). B.2 obtains is also preferred in that it takes account of the fact that the identification of wills is to a certain extent a national problem and is likely to remain such even in the long term (despite the trend towards citizens having increasing cross-border links). This preference is also in line with the rating made by the stakeholders. CONTENT: t he objective of this proposal is to enable people living in the European Union to organise their succession in advance and effectively to guarantee the rights of heirs and/or legatees and of other persons linked to the deceased, as well as creditors of the succession. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : t he concept of “succession” must be interpreted in an autonomous manner and encompasses all the elements of a succession, in particular its handover, administration and liquidation. This proposal shall apply to successions to the estates of deceased persons. It shall not apply to revenue, customs or administrative matters. Other areas to be excluded include: maintenance obligations; questions covered by company law; the constitution, functioning and dissolving of trusts; the nature of rights in rem relating to property and publicising these rights. Jurisdiction : the rules of legal jurisdiction relating to succession vary considerably between the Member States. This leads to positive conflicts, where the courts in several States declare themselves to be competent, or negative conflicts, where no court declares itself to be competent. In order to avoid these difficulties for citizens, a uniform rule is required. As regards applicable law , the choice to create a single scheme by means of a regulation allows the succession to be subjected to a single law, thereby avoiding these disadvantages. The proposal provides for the application of a single criterion for determining both the jurisdiction of the authorities and the law applicable to a cross-border succession: the deceased's habitual place of residence. People living abroad will, however, be able to opt to have the law of their country of nationality apply to the entirety of their succession. All assets making up a succession will thus be governed by one and the same law, thereby reducing the risk that different Member States will issue contradictory decisions. Likewise, a single authority - that of the country of habitual residence - will be competent for settling the succession; it will, however, be able to refer the matter to the competent authority of the country of nationality where the latter is better placed to hear the case. The Regulation has removed the possibility of choosing as the law applicable to succession the law applicable to matrimonial property scheme of the testator. Such a provision would have allowed multiple choices where, for the matrimonial property schemes, the spouses benefit from greater flexibility in their choice of applicable law. The proposal includes rules governing the law applicable to the agreements as to succession and joint wills used in certain States, e.g. in order to organise the transfer of a company and for couples to allow the surviving spouse to benefit from joint property. The proposal also includes an Article which takes into account the specific features of common law legal systems, such as the English legal system, where the heirs do not directly acquire the rights of the deceased upon the latter's death but where the succession is managed by an administrator appointed and supervised by the judge. Lastly, recourse to public policy must occur in exceptional circumstances only. Differences between the laws relating to the protection of the legitimate interests of the relatives of the deceased must not be used to justify its use, as this would be incompatible with the objective of ensuring the application of a single law to all of the succession property. Recognition and enforcement : p rovision is made for the recognition of all the decisions and legal transactions in order to give substance in succession matters to the principle of mutual recognition, which is based on the principle of mutual trust. The grounds for non-recognition have therefore been kept to the necessary minimum. Authentic instruments : in view of the practical importance of authentic instruments in succession matters, this Regulation should ensure their recognition in order to allow their free movement. This recognition means that they will enjoy the same full and complete evidentiary effect in respect of the contents of the recorded instruments and the facts contained therein as that of national authentic instruments or on the same basis as in their country of origin, a presumption of authenticity, and an enforceable nature within the limits set by this Regulation. European Certificate of Succession : in order to enable international successions to be settled rapidly, this Regulation introduces a European Certificate of Succession. To facilitate its circulation in the Union, a uniform model certificate should be adopted and an authority appointed which would have the international competence to issue it. This certificate does not replace existing certificates in certain Member States. In the Member State of the competent authority, the capacity of heir and the powers of an administrator or executor of the succession must therefore be proven according to the domestic procedure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the deepening of the financial crisis in some of the Member States is affecting substantially the real economy due to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by Governments to borrow money from the market. In this context, the proper implementation of programmes funded by the EFF is of particular importance because it facilitates financial assistance to the real economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the euro countries or from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non euro countries. To date, six countries have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme: Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. These Member States (and indeed any other Member State which may be concerned in the future by such assistance programmes) should receive help to continue the implementation of the programmes funded by the EFF by increasing the sums allocated to the countries concerned for the period for which they are under the support mechanisms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to increase payments to the countries concerned, for the period they are under the support mechanisms. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to ensure that these Member States continue the implementation of the EFF programmes on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains provisions that would allow the Commission to make increased payments to these countries, for the period they are under the support mechanisms. It is proposed to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund so as to enable the Commission to reimburse the newly declared expenditure for the period in question by an increased amount calculated by applying a 10 percentage point top-up of the applicable co-financing rates for the priority axis. In applying the top-up, the co-financing rate of the programme cannot exceed by more than 10 percentage points the maximum ceilings of the EFF Regulation. In any case, contribution from the funds to the priority axis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned in the Commission decision. This will be a temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits the support mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPACT: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of the European Fisheries Fund financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. For payment appropriations in 2012, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal will imply an increase of payment appropriations (for 2012 approximately EUR 20 million) which will be compensated by the end of the programming period. Therefore, the total payment appropriations for the whole programming period remain unchanged. The Commission will, in 2012, review the need for additional payment credits and if necessary propose the necessary actions to the Budgetary Authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the United States of America and the European Commission regarding the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by the United States to certain products of the European Communities, endorsed by the Council by letter of 12 May 2009 and signed in Geneva on 13 May 2009. The aim of that Memorandum of Understanding is to settle the long-standing WTO dispute between the European Union and the United States of America on Beef Hormones, European Communities— Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products (Hormones) (DS 26). It foresees a three-phased arrangement which progressively reduces the level of sanctions imposed by the United States on products from the Union, while the Union progressively increases the tariff-rate quota for high-quality beef that is not treated with growth hormones. The first-phase tariff-rate quota for high quality beef of 20 000 tonnes was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2009. In a second phase, the United States would suspend all remaining sanctions and the Union would expand this tariff rate quota by additional 25 000 tonnes. On 17 March 2011, the Commission also signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Canada and the European Commission regarding the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by Canada to certain products of the European Union.  This MoU brings about the suspension of all sanctions imposed by Canada and stipulates the further expansion of the Union autonomous tariff rate quota for high-quality beef by 1 500 tonnes (first phase) and additional 1 700 tonnes (second phase). The timing foreseen for the first and second phases in the US and Canada Memoranda is the same. It is envisaged in particular that the second phase would normally begin on 1 August 2012 under both Memoranda. In order to be in a position to establish the above-mentioned increases of the existing tariff rate quota for high-quality beef, to a total of 21 500 tonnes (first phase) and subsequently, 48 200 tonnes foreseen in the second phase of both Memoranda of Understanding starting on 1 August 2012, the legislative procedure needs to be started in a timely manner. This is also necessary in order to follow the Resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 8 March 2011 calling on the Commission to ensure that the settlement of the 'beef hormones' dispute will allow for the suspension of the sanctions on EU products, while guaranteeing that beef imports to the EU will be in line with EU requirements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to request the European Parliament and the Council to amend the existing Regulation opening an autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef, in order to implement the steps set out in the MoU signed with the United States of America and Canada, respectively. The measure aims to modify the annual autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef in the context of the EU-US and the EU-Canada Memoranda of Understanding on ""beef hormones"". This quota was initially established by Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2009. It increases the tariff quota by 1 500 tonnes in the first phase following the EU-Canada MoU. In the second phase (from August 2012) an increase of the tariff quota by 26 700 tonnes is foreseen, as envisaged by the EU-US MoU and the EU-Canada MoU. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the customs duty of this tariff-rate quota would remain fixed at zero. Depending on the future beef market situation, imports of high-quality beef may therefore no longer be shipped using the existing quota set up by Regulation (EC) No 810/2008 or out-of-quota. This may imply a loss of own resources of the Union which would be approximately EUR 4.6 million net amount after deduction of collection costs for Member States."

CONTENT: a number of basic regulations relating to the common commercial policy provide that acts implementing the common commercial policy are to be adopted by the Council according to procedures set down in the various instruments concerned or by the Commission subject to specific procedures and control by the Council. Such procedures are not subject to Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (comitology). It is appropriate to amend those regulations in order to ensure consistency with the provisions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon which has led to significant changes both in the framework for the adoption of delegated and implementing acts and for the conduct of trade policy. This should be done, where appropriate, through the granting of delegated powers to the Commission and by applying certain procedures set out in Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States. One of the key objectives of the abovementioned regulation, proposed by the Commission in March 2009, is to provide that the control of the Commission's exercise of its implementing powers is conducted not by the Council or the European Parliament but by the Member States as is required by Article 291 of the Treaty. In the proposal, this is achieved by the creation of procedures (the advisory and examination procedures) whereby the Commission's implementing acts are subject to control by the Member States combined with an automatic alignment of existing procedures established under Council Decision 1999/468/EC. The current proposal addresses procedures for the control or adoption of acts in twenty four basic acts in the field of the common commercial policy not previously subject to Council Decision 1999/468/EC. Aligning the control of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers on the Regulation on the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers will bring additional advantages. In particular, it will permit a more effective and efficient exercise of the Commission's implementing powers and so contribute to a more effective and efficient common commercial policy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

In its Communication of 3 July 2009 , it examined the role played by derivatives in the financial crisis and, in its 20 October 2009 Communication , it set out the future policy actions the Commission intended to propose to increase transparency of the derivatives market, reduce counterparty and operational risk in trading and enhance market integrity and oversight. In September 2009, G-20 Leaders agreed in Pittsburgh that all standardised OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by end-2012 at the latest and that OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories. In June 2010, G20 Leaders in Toronto reaffirmed their commitment and also committed to accelerate the implementation of strong measures to improve transparency and regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way. This initiative is part of a larger international effort to increase the stability of the financial system in general, and the OTC derivatives market in particular. Given the global nature of the OTC derivatives market an internationally coordinated approach is crucial. This proposal for a Regulation delivers the Commission's commitments to proceed rapidly and with determination. It takes also into account the strong support and the many of the measures suggested in Parliament’s Resolution of 15 June 2010 , on ""Derivatives markets: future policy actions"". It is also consistent with the recently adopted US legislation on OTC derivatives, the so-called Frank-Dodd Act. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that the largest net benefits would be achieved through the adoption of measures that would: require the use of Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing for OTC derivatives that meet predefined eligibility criteria; set specific targets for legal and process standardisation; set specific targets for the bilateral clearing of OTC derivatives transactions; require market participants to report all the necessary information on their OTC derivatives portfolios to a trade repository or, if that would not be possible, directly to regulators; and require the publication of aggregate position information. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). A uniform process at EU level is needed to determine which OTC Derivatives are eligible for mandatory clearing through CCPs. CONTENT: the scope of the Regulation is wide and lays down uniform requirements covering financial counterparties, non-financial counterparties (exceeding certain thresholds) and all categories of OTC derivative contracts. Its prudential parts apply to central counterparties as a result of the clearing obligation and, for the reporting requirement, to trade repositories. The authorisation and supervision requirements for CCPs apply irrespective of the financial instrument the CCPs clear - whether OTC or other. Exemptions are explicitly foreseen for the members of the European System of Central Banks, public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt and to multilateral development banks. The main features of the proposal are as follows: Clearing, reporting and risk mitigation of OTC Derivatives: 'standardised' contracts will mean those contracts that are eligible for clearing by CCPs. In order to apply this, the Regulation establishes a process that will take into account the risk aspects connected to mandatory clearing. In order to establish a process that ensures that as many OTC contracts as possible will be cleared, the Regulation introduces two approaches to determine which contracts must be cleared: a 'bottom-up' approach, according to which a CCP decides to clear certain contracts and is authorised to do so by its competent authority, who is then obliged to inform the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) once it approves the CCP to clear those contracts. ESMA will then have the powers to decide whether a clearing obligation should apply to all of those contracts in the EU. ESMA will need to base that decision on certain objective criteria; a 'top-down' approach according to which ESMA, together with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), will determine which contracts should potentially be subject to the clearing obligation. This process is important to identify and capture those contracts in the market that are not yet being cleared by a CCP. Counterparties that are subjected to the clearing obligation cannot simply avoid the requirement by deciding not to participate in a CCP. If those counterparties do not meet the participation requirements or are not interested in becoming clearing members, they must enter into the necessary arrangements with clearing members to access the CCP as clients. Furthermore, CCPs should not be allowed to accept only those transactions concluded on execution venues with which they have a privileged relationship or which are part of the same group. As regards non-financial (corporate) counterparties, they will in principle not be subject to the rules of this Regulation, unless their OTC derivatives positions reach a threshold and are considered to be systemically important. The Regulation sets out a process that helps to identify the non-financial institutions with systemically important positions in OTC derivatives and subjects them to certain obligations specified under the Regulation. The process is based on the definition of two thresholds: a) an information threshold and b) a clearing threshold. These thresholds will be specified by the European Commission on the basis of draft regulatory standards proposed by ESMA, in consultation with the ESRB and other relevant authorities. Moreover, as not all OTC derivatives will be considered eligible for central clearing, there remains a need to improve arrangements and the safety of those contracts that will continue to be managed on a so-called 'bilateral' basis. The Regulation therefore requires the use of electronic means and the existence of risk management procedures with timely, accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral, and an appropriate and proportionate holding of capital. Lastly, financial counterparties and non-financial counterparty above the clearing threshold must report the details of any derivative contract they have entered into and any modification thereof (including novation and termination) to a registered trade repository. In the exceptional case that a trade repository is not capable of recoding the details of a particular OTC derivatives contract, the Regulation requires that this information should be provided directly to the relevant competent authority. The Commission will need to be empowered to determine the details, type, format and frequency of the reports for the different classes of derivatives, following draft technical standards to be developed by ESMA. Requirements applicable to CCPs: given that CCPs have to assume additional risks, the Regulation requires that, for security reasons, they are subjected to rigorous organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements (internal governance rules, increased capital requirements, etc.). To begin with, a CCP must have in place robust governance arrangements. These will respond to any potential conflicts of interest between owners, management, clearing members and indirect participants. The role of independent board members is particularly relevant. Secondly, to be authorised to exercise its activity, a CCP is required to have a minimum quantum of capital. The Regulation will require a CCP to have a mutualised default fund to which members of the CCP will have to contribute. Authorisation and supervision of trade repositories : the Regulation provides for a reporting requirement of OTC derivative transactions to increase the transparency of this market. The information must be reported to trade repositories. In view of the central role of trade repositories in the collection of regulatory information, the Regulation gives ESMA the powers to register trade repositories, withdraw the registration and to perform the surveillance of trade repositories. Requirements for trade repositories:  the Regulation also contains provisions for trade repositories to guarantee their compliance with a set of standards. These are designed to ensure that the information that trade repositories maintain for regulatory purposes is reliable, secured and protected. In particular, trade repositories will be subject to organisational and operational requirements and ensure appropriate safeguarding and transparency of data."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2006, the medical community informed the Commission of its concerns about implementing this Directive, claiming that the exposure limit values laid down therein would place disproportionate limitations on the use and development of medical magnetic resonance applications (MR), considered today to be a vital tool for the diagnosis and treatment of a number of diseases. Other industrial sectors subsequently expressed their concerns about the impact of the Directive on their activities. In response to these concerns, the Commission took a number of steps: to enable the Commission to conduct an in-depth impact analysis and propose amendments, the deadline for transposition of the Directive was put back from 30 April 2008 to 30 April 2012 by Directive 2008/46/EC ; the Commission examined the situation thoroughly, analysing the latest scientific studies on the negative impact the exposure limit values set by the Directive might have on the medical use of imaging technologies using magnetic resonance (MR) ; after a significant number of consultations of stakeholders and having due regard to the latest scientific recommendations, the Commission adopted, on 14 June 2011, the proposal for a new Directive to amend and replace Directive 2004/40/EC, with a view to guaranteeing a high level of health and safety protection for workers while at the same time enabling medical and other industrial activities using electromagnetic fields to continue and develop; once the Commission proposal had been adopted, the European Parliament and the Council immediately started work with a view to amending Directive 2004/40/EC before 30 April 2012. However, because of i) the technical complexity of the subject-matter, requiring long discussions with national experts; ii) the highly divergent views on some key provisions of the proposal, the European Parliament and the Council will be unlikely to finalise the adoption process before 30 April 2012. Under these circumstances, a new Directive is required to postpone for a second time the deadline for transposition of Directive 2004/40/EC in order to prevent an uncertain legal situation from arising after 30 April 2012 IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given the urgency of the proposal and its limited impact, this proposal is not accompanied by a specific impact assessment. Doing nothing at this stage would oblige the great majority of Member States which have not yet transposed Directive 2004/40/EC into national law to do so and to enforce it within a very short period of time, i.e. by the current deadline of 30 April 2012, with potentially serious consequences for the continuity of healthcare services using MRI. Moreover, the legal uncertainty that might arise due to the non-transposition of the Directive could have the following consequences: the Commission would in principle have to launch infringement proceedings for non-communication of transposition measures against any Member States which have not transposed the Directive yet; Directive 2004/40/EC would start to have direct vertical effect in the national legal order of all Member States, and citizens could take their governments to court for their failure to implement the Directive. Postponing the date of transposition will not unduly impede the use of MRI or other industrial activities. At the same time, postponement would give sufficient time for the Directive, in particular the exposure limit values, to be updated and improved, by means of a new Directive based on the Commission proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is simply to postpone the deadline for the transposition of Directive 2004/40/EC until 30 April 2014. These extra two years will give sufficient time for the Directive, and particularly the exposure limit values, to be updated and improved, by means of a new Directive proposed by the Commission which is currently being discussed in the Council and the EP. The two-year postponement will also avoid any negative legal consequences in the legal orders of Member States which have not yet transposed the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal will have no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in Southeast Asia was signed on 24 February 1976 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Since this date, a number of Southeast Asian countries have been contracted to this Treaty in addition to the United States of America, Turkey and Canada. The Treaty aims to promote peace, stability and co-operation in the region. To this end, it calls for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of security in Southeast Asia. Hence, the rules and principles set out in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation correspond to the objectives of the Union’s common foreign and security polity. The Council, at its meeting on 4-5 December 2006, authorised the Presidency and the Commission to negotiate the European Union’s and the European Community’s accessions to the TAC. By letter of 7 December 2006, the European Union and the European Community have informed Cambodia, in its capacity of ASEAN Co-ordinator for relations with the EU, of its decision to apply for accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia subject to the understandings expressed in the letter. On 28 May 2009, Thailand, then Chair of ASEAN, declared the consent of all the States in Southeast Asia to the accession to the Treaty by the European Union and the European Community, subject to the entry into force of the Third Protocol to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. On 23 July 2010, this Third Protocol to the Treaty was signed which allows for the accession of regional organisations to the said Treaty. The European Union should therefore accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 37 TEU and Articles 209 and 211 TFEU in conjunction with Article 31(1) TEU and Article 218(6)(a) and (8), the second subparagraph of the TFEU. CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, it is proposed that the European Union accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. The purpose of this Treaty is to promote perpetual peace, everlasting amity and cooperation in Southeast Asia. Principles : in their relations with one another, the High Contracting Parties shall be guided by the following fundamental principles: (i) mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and national identity of all nations; (ii) the right of every State to lead its national existence free from external interference, subversion or coersion; (iii) non-interference in the internal affairs of one another; (iv) settlement of differences or disputes by peaceful means; (v) renunciation of the threat or use of force; (vi) effective cooperation among themselves. Cooperation : Parties shall promote active cooperation in the economic, social, technical, scientific and administrative fields as well as in matters of common ideals and aspirations of international peace and stability in the region and all other matters of common interest. Parties shall collaborate for the acceleration of the economic growth in the region in order to strengthen the foundation for a prosperous and peaceful community of nations in Southeast Asia. To this end, they shall promote the greater utilization of their agriculture and industries, the expansion of their trade and the improvement of their economic infrastructure for the mutual benefit of their peoples. In this regard, they shall continue to explore all avenues for close and beneficial cooperation with other States as well as international and regional organisations outside the region. Parties, in order to achieve social justice and to raise the standards of living of the peoples of the region, shall intensify economic cooperation. Other provisions : the Treaty also provides provisions are regards: the settlement of disputes; the procedure as regards the entry into force, the implementation and the application of the Treaty.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the sustained financial and economic crisis is increasing the pressure on national financial resources as Member States are reducing their budgets. In this context ensuring a smooth implementation of cohesion policy programmes is of particular importance as a tool for injecting funds into the economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes requires significant amounts of funding from public and private stakeholders, who, due to the the liquidity problems faced by financial institutions are not able to provide such funding. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the EURO countries or from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non EURO countries. To date, six countries - including Greece which has received financial assistance outside the EFSM - have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme. These countries are Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. In order to alleviate those problems and to speed up the implementation of the operational programmes and projects, as well as to strengthen the economic recovery, it is appropriate that the managing authorities of the Member States having experienced serious difficulties with respect to financial stability and which have been granted financial assistance according to one of the financial assistance mechanisms set out above may contribute financial resources from operational programmes to the establishment of risk sharing instruments providing loans or guarantees or other financial facilities, in support of projects and operations foreseen under an operational programme. It should be noted that the Commission also adopted in August 2011 a proposal for an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 with a view to increase the amount of community contribution reimbursed through interim payments and payments of the final balance by up to 10 percentage points above the current limits. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to implement under indirect centralised management risk sharing instrument to cover risks related to loans and guarantees to be given to project promoters and other public or private partners. This will not impose additional financial requirements to the overall budget since the total financial allocation for the period from the Funds to the Member States in question will not change. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to risk sharing instruments for Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability with a view to: allow for risk sharing instrument to be managed under indirect centralised management; allow Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, to contribute part of their allocations under the ""Convergence"" and ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objectives of cohesion policy to the provisioning and capital allocations to loans or guarantees issued to project promoters and other public or private partners directly or indirectly by the EIB or other international financial institutions. The terms and conditions applicable to such risk sharing instrument should be decided by the Commission, upon request from the Member State concerned. The Commission upon request of the Member States concerned should adopt ad hoc decisions to set the terms and conditions applicable to such instrument, on the basis of allocations to be transferred from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund allocations from the Member State concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. The Commission will in 2012 review the need for additional payment credits and if necessary propose the necessary actions to the Budgetary Authority."

BACKGROUND: on 28 July 2011, the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organisation ('DSB') adopted the Appellate Body Report and the Panel Report as modified by the Appellate Body Report in the case ‘European Communities — Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Certain Iron or Steel Fasteners from China' (‘Reports’). In the Reports, it was found that Article 9(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 ('the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation') was inconsistent with Articles 6.10, 9.2 and 18.4 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement. Article 9(5) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation provides that individual exporting producers in non-market economy countries which do not receive market economy treatment pursuant to Article 2(7)(c) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation will be subject to a countrywide duty rate unless such exporters can demonstrate that they meet the conditions for individual treatment laid out in Article 9(5) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. On 18 August 2011 the European Union notified the DSB that it intends to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this dispute in a manner that respects its WTO obligations. On 19 January 2012 the European Union and China agreed that the reasonable period of time for implementing the DSB recommendations and rulings would be 14 months and two weeks from the date the DSB adopted the Reports. The reasonable period of time will therefore expire on 12 October 2012. The purpose of this legislative proposal is to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings on Article 9(5) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal provides that Article 9(5) of the Regulation will be amended to state that an anti-dumping duty will be imposed in the appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis on imports of a product from all sources found to be dumped and causing injury, except for imports from those sources from which undertakings under the terms of the Regulation have been accepted. The Regulation imposing anti-dumping measures shall specify the duty for each supplier or, if that is impracticable, the supplying country concerned. Suppliers which are legally distinct from other suppliers or which are legally distinct from the State may nevertheless be considered as a single entity for the purpose of specifying the duty. Account may be taken of factors such as the existence of structural or corporate links between the suppliers and the State or between suppliers, the control or material influence by the State in respect of pricing and output, or the economic structure of the supplying country. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the EU budget."

On 22 October 2007, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1342/2007 on administering certain restrictions on imports of certain steel products from the Russian Federation in order to implement the Agreement. The Agreement stipulates that in the event that the Russian Federation accedes to the World Trade Organisation before the expiration of the Agreement, the Agreement will be terminated and as a consequence the quantitative limits will be abolished as of the date of accession. On the date when the Russian Federation becomes a member of the World Trade Organisation the Regulation to implement the Agreement will no longer be necessary. Regulation (EC) No 1342/2007 should therefore be repealed with effect from that date. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 TFEU. CONTENT: this proposal for a regulation provides for the repeal of Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2007 implementing that Agreement in the EU. The Regulation will take effect on the date on which the Russian Federation accedes to the World Trade Organisation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community has been substantially amended. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. A report adopted by the Commission on the current roaming Regulation indicates that it has temporarily reduced prices for roaming phone calls and text messages but has not remedied the lack of competition in the roaming market, with prices remaining stubbornly close to the retail caps. The Commission's proposal would tackle the current lack of competition and consumer choice by: making it easier for alternative operators, like mobile virtual network operators, to enter roaming markets by requiring network operators in other Member States to give them access to their networks at regulated wholesale prices. This would create more competition between operators on roaming markets, and so increase the incentives for them to offer customers more attractive prices and services; letting consumers choose an alternative provider for roaming services, irrespective of their national provider. Each time the customer crossed a border, they would automatically switch to their chosen roaming provider, without any further action on their part, while keeping the same number and subscriber identity module (SIM card). This would enhance transparency and allow customers to shop around for the best roaming offers and encourage operators to offer more competitive roaming deals. The proposal aims to meet the objective set in the Digital Agenda for Europe that differences between roaming and national telecoms tariffs should approach zero by 2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: to cover the period until structural measures become fully effective and competition drives retail prices down, the proposal would progressively lower current retail price caps on voice and texting (SMS) services and introduce a new retail price cap for mobile data services. By 1 July 2014, roaming consumers would pay no more than: 24 cents per minute to make a call, a maximum 10 cents per minute to receive a call, maximum 10 cents to send a text message and maximum 50 cents per Megabyte (MB) to download data or browse the Internet whilst travelling abroad (charged per Kilobyte used). More specifically, until these structural solutions fully delivered their results the proposal would: introduce a new retail price cap for data roaming (which would remain in force until mid-2016). This would ensure that users of smart phones, tablets and other devices to access the Internet through mobile networks could go online whilst abroad without running up huge bills. The Commission proposes that consumers would pay no more than 90 cents per Megabyte (MB) downloaded from 1 July 2012, falling very steeply to 50 cents per MB by July 2014 (such prices would be charged on a Kilobyte basis, taking into account effective use). The current Regulation does not foresee retail price caps for data roaming. Wholesale price caps for data roaming have been in place since July 2009, but savings have not been passed on to the consumer. The overall average retail price of EUR 1.06 to download data in another Member State at the end of 2010 masks a wide variation in retail prices. For example, it costs consumers an average of EUR 2.23 per MB when downloading abroad on another mobile group's network and in some cases charges reached much higher levels (even as high as EUR 12 per MB). It is important to note that the proposed retail caps serve as a mere safety-net for consumers, while the Commission expects that the proposed competition-enhancing structural measures would deliver innovative pan-European offers and cheaper prices, significantly below the safeguard caps; keep retail price caps for roaming voice and text message (SMS). These would gradually decrease for all roaming services and would also remain in force until mid-2016; keep data roaming ""bill shock"" protection – consumers' and business travellers' monthly bills for data access over mobile networks when abroad would continue to be limited to EUR 50 unless the customer explicitly agreed otherwise; retain caps on wholesale prices between operators for all roaming services until 2022 (voice, SMS and data) in order to create a predictable investment environment for alternative operators. Wholesale price caps could be removed before 2022 if market data indicated that competition had developed sufficiently; under the new Regulation, operators would still be obliged to provide information on roaming prices to consumers when crossing into another Member State, but customers would be able to easily opt out of receiving this information. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) n° 689/2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals implements the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade. The Rotterdam Convention was adopted in September 1998. It entered into force on 24 February 2004. Its aim is to promote shared responsibility and co-operative efforts among the Parties in the international trade of dangerous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use. Regulation (EC) n° 689/2008 go beyond those of the Convention and offer more protection to importing countries since they are addressed to all countries and not just Parties to the Convention. The scope of the Regulation is not limited to chemicals that are banned or severely restricted under the Convention but also covers chemicals that are banned or severely restricted at EU level. In addition the Regulation ensures that all chemicals are appropriately packed and labelled when exported.  It is now necessary to align Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) 1907/2006.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT: as the overall impact of the review is expected to be limited, it was not considered imperative to carry out an impact assessment. The main effects of the changes can be summarised as follows: there will be more clarity, transparency and increased legal certainty for all parties involved in the implementation of the  Regulation;  the proposal will not add any additional administrative burden for exporters or the competent authorities involved in the implementation of the Regulation. On the contrary, with respect to exports that are exempted from export notification the proposed amendments will lead to a reduction of administrative burdens;  some tasks will be transferred from the Commission to the European Chemicals Agency, which is expected to reduce the overall costs and to increase the scientific knowledge available for implementation;  the current high level of protection of human health and the environment will be maintained. LEGAL BASIS: in line with the judgment of the Court in case C-178/03 ( Commission v Parliament and Council ), the proposed Regulation will be based on Article 192(1) (relating to Environmental Protection) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union and Article 207 (relating to the Common Commercial Policy).  CONTENT: the proposed new Regulation would essentially maintain all provisions of the current Regulation, including those that go beyond the requirements of the Convention. However, certain technical amendments are deemed necessary to improve the clarity and functioning of the Regulation. The main changes are as follows: Definitions : bearing in mind Regulation 1272/2008 and the experience gained from the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, the proposal makes certain technical amendments to the operative provisions such as clarify the definitions of a substance, a mixture and an article, and the reference identification number required for exports that are not subject to export notification.– Explicit consent procedure : in around 30% of the cases to date, despite the efforts made by the designated national authorities (DNAs) of the exporting Member States and the Commission to obtain explicit consent, no response is forthcoming from the importing country, in some cases for many months or even years. As a result, exports cannot proceed, despite the fact that the substances are often not banned or severely restricted in the importing countries. The proposal makes provision for additional conditions that may allow exports to proceed in the absence of a reply from the importing country whilst not lowering the protection afforded to importing countries. It is proposed to allow the export to proceed if there is documentary evidence from official sources showing that the chemical has been imported or used in the last 5 years and no regulatory action has been taken, if, despite all reasonable efforts by the exporter’s DNA, the Agency and the Commission, there is no response from the importing country within 2 months. Involvement of the European Chemicals Agency : in order to support the Commission in its tasks as a common designated authority foreseen under the Regulation, it is proposed to involve the European Chemicals Agency in certain administrative, technical and scientific tasks necessary for the implementation of the Regulation, in particular regarding the management of the European Database on Export and Import of dangerous chemicals. Adaptation of provisions to the Lisbon Treaty: in view of the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, it is necessary to clarify provisions relating to the external representation of the European Union and to adapt the provisions concerning comitology. In particular, it should be specified which rules are subject to implementing acts and clarified which conditions apply to the adoption of delegated acts. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is not expected to have important budgetary implications since no new tasks were introduced compared to Regulation (EC) 689/2008. The transfer of certain tasks from the Commission to the European Chemicals Agency is expected to reduce the overall costs of implementation. Further reductions may be achieved in a long-term perspective considering the potential for synergies with other tasks of the Agency. The financing of the tasks carried out by the European Chemicals Agency will be provided in form of a subsidy from the Union budget.  DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains certain provisions conferring on the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Council conclusions of 23 November 1998 and of 5 November 2002 on euro coins intended for collection, the Commission Recommendation 2009/23/EC on common guidelines for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation, and the Commission Recommendation 2010/191/EU on the scope and effects of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins, provide for recommended practices regarding euro collector coins, the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation, including commemorative circulation coins, and consultation prior to the destruction of fit euro circulation coins. The lack of mandatory provisions for issuance of euro coins may result in different practices among Member States and does not achieve a sufficiently integrated framework for the single currency. In the interest of legal transparency and certainty, it is therefore necessary to introduce binding rules for the issuance of euro coins. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposed Regulation lays down rules on the issuance of euro circulation coins, including commemorative circulation coins, on the issuance of euro collector coins, and on consultation prior to the destruction of fit euro circulation coins. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Apart from regular euro circulation coins, Member States may also issue commemorative euro circulation coins to celebrate specific subjects, subject to limits set per year and issuing Member State for the number of issues of such coins. The proposal establishes certain volume limits for commemorative circulation coins in order to ensure that such coins remain a minor percentage of the total number of the 2-euro coins in circulation. At the same time, these volume limits should allow for the issuance of a sufficient volume of coins to ensure that commemorative coins can circulate effectively. Member States should also be able to issue euro collector coins, which are not intended for circulation and which should be readily distinguishable from euro circulation coins. Euro collector coins should have legal tender status only in the Member State of issuance and should not be issued with a view to their entry into circulation. In order to ensure that euro collector coins are not confused with euro circulation coins they should be readily distinguishable from the latter. It is furthermore appropriate that issuances of euro collector coins are accounted for in the volume of coins to be approved by the European Central Bank (ECB), but on an aggregate basis rather than for each individual issue. It is appropriate and in line with common practice among participating Member States that euro circulation coins, including commemorative circulation coins, should be put into circulation at face value, although a minor proportion may be sold at a higher price if produced with a special quality or presented in special packaging. In order to avoid that fit euro circulation coins are destroyed by one Member State while there may be a need of such coins in another, Member States should consult each other prior to the destruction of such coins. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union (EU) has granted trade preferences to developing countries through the Generalised Scheme of Tariff Preferences (GSP scheme) since 1971. It is part of its common commercial policy, in accordance with the general provisions governing the EU’s external action. It is one of the key EU trade instruments assisting developing countries in their efforts to ensure core human and labour rights, reduce poverty and promote sustainable development and good governance in developing countries. The Generalised System of Preferences helps developing countries, and particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs), to reduce poverty by offering them import preferences in order to generate or boost revenue from international trade. In addition, the scheme provides incentives in the form of additional tariff preferences, to countries that commit themselves to sustainable development and good government. The scheme grants preferential access to EU markets on a generalised and non-discriminatory basis to 176 eligible countries and territories. It has three arrangements: the general arrangement (often described simply as ""GSP""); the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (described as ""GSP+"") which offers additional preferences as incentives to support vulnerable developing countries in ratifying and implementing 27 international conventions on human and labour rights, environment and good governance; the Everything But Arms arrangement (EBA), which provides duty-free, quota-free access to LDCs. The present GSP scheme is implemented through successive regulations, each applying for three years. The current GSP regulation will expire on 31 December 2011. A recently completed midterm review provides the background for the planned Commission proposal for a revised regulation to replace the existing scheme upon expiry in 2013. Both the EBA arrangement and the rules of origin provisions fall outside the scope of this revision: the former, because it is not subject to periodic reviews; and the latter, because new legislation on rules of origin has entered into force in 2011. The proposed GSP Regulation herewith revises, adapts and updates the GSP scheme in replacement of the current regulation, so as to better reflect the contemporary global economic and trade landscape which has changed significantly since the original scheme was put into place. Option A : discontinuation: preferences are abandoned for GSP and GSP+ beneficiaries. EBA arrangement would remain. The economic and social effects for countries most in need are expected to be negative. LDCs would benefit, but the many other developing countries and economic sectors which are also most in need would suffer as preferential access disappears. This option would however have positive economic and social impacts for certain sectors in certain Member States at a time when so much emphasis is on boosting competitiveness, growth and job creation. And last, at a time of extreme pressure on public finances, it boosts tariff revenues. Option B : no policy change: there is a natural reduction in the level of import duties (and, therefore, preferences) due to preference erosion under the impact of further bilateral and multilateral trade deals. In the long run, when all multilateral and bilateral agreements are fully implemented, duties are likely to be so low that the idea of preferences becomes largely irrelevant – and so would a generalised system of preferences. Other totally different tools may have to be designed. Until then, the question is what can be done for the countries most in need of preferences. Option C : partial redesign: this comprises two sub-options (C1 and C2). Preferences are deferred for certain eligible countries: overseas countries and territories; high and upper middle income countries; countries with a preferential trade agreement covering substantially all preferences. The main difference between C2 and C1 concern the graduation of competitive sectors and the vulnerability criteria under GSP+. Option D : full redesign: in order to simplify the analysis, D sub-options are calculated as increments to C2 only. Three sub-options are assessed. D1 is a far reaching option. It provides full product coverage expansion and elimination of all sensitive products (eg, extending the duty-free, quota-free treatment of EBA countries) to all countries most in need (whether GSP or GSP+). This implies that the remaining beneficiaries are no longer subject to graduation. D2 and D3 are less far-reaching. They take all the parameters of C2 (graduation included) and add partial de-sensitisation (D2) and partial expansion in product coverage (D3). draft proposal would focus the GSP preferences on the countries most in need. This is achieved by enhancing GSP modalities related to the GSP eligibility criteria and the GSP graduation mechanism, which identifies competitive imports and suspends unwarranted preferences. Modification of the GSP+ mechanism : the scheme also expands its support under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) for those countries that commit to embracing core universal values on human, labour rights, environment and governance. While offering further opportunities for potential beneficiaries, the scheme will place more responsibility for countries and require stricter scrutiny of eligibility by the EU. special arrangement for least developing countries known as ‘Everything But Arms’, which was added to the GSP scheme in 2004, is unchanged and further supported by new elements in the scheme reflecting the aim of focusing GSP benefits on countries most in need."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he unprecedented global crisis that has hit the world over the last three years has seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in the government deficit and debt position of the Member States, leading a number of them to seek financial assistance outside the framework of the Union. The full consistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established by the Treaty and the possible policy conditions attached to this financial assistance should be enshrined in Union law. The economic and financial integration of the Member States whose currency is the euro calls for a reinforced surveillance to prevent a contagion from a Member State experiencing difficulties with respect to its financial stability to the rest of the euro area. The intensity of the economic and fiscal surveillance should be commensurate to the severity of the financial difficulties encountered and should take due account of the nature of the financial assistance received, which may range from a mere precautionary support based on eligibility conditions up to a full macro-economic adjustment programme involving strict policy conditionality IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on strengthened surveillance for the euro area builds on what has already been agreed in the ‘Six Pack’ set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December. It sets out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and/or that receive or may receive financial assistance from one or several other States, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or other International Financial Institutions (IFI), such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Enhanced surveillance : the proposed Regulation strengthening economic and fiscal surveillance of euro area countries facing or threatened with serious financial instability would ensure that the surveillance of these Member States under a financial assistance programme, or facing a serious threat of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law. The Commission would be able to decide whether a Member State experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability should be subject to enhanced surveillance. The Council would be able to issue a recommendation to such Member States to request financial assistance. A Member State under enhanced surveillance shall, in consultation and cooperation with the Commission, acting in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties. The Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under surveillance to verify the progresses made in the implementation of the measures. Where it is concluded that further measures are needed and the financial situation of the Member State concerned has significant adverse effects on the financial stability of the euro area, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may recommend to the Member State concerned to seek financial assistance and to prepare a macro-economic adjustment programme. The Council may decide to make this recommendation public. Where a recommendation is made public: (a) the relevant Committee of the European Parliament may invite representatives of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views; (b) representatives of the Commission may be invited by the parliament of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views. Macro-economic adjustment programme : a Member State receiving financial assistance from one or several other States, the IMF, the EFSF or the ESM shall prepare in agreement with the Commission - acting in liaison with the ECB - a draft adjustment programme aimed at re-establishing a sound and sustainable economic and financial situation and restoring its capacity to finance itself fully on the financial markets. The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall approve the adjustment programme. The Commission, in liaison with the ECB, shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the adjustment programme . It shall - in liaison with the ECB - examine with the Member State concerned the changes that may be needed to its adjustment programme. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide on any change to be made to the adjustment programme. Post-programme surveillance : a Member State shall be under post-programme surveillance as long as a minimum of 75% of the financial assistance received from one or several other Member State(s), the EFSM, the EFSF or the ESM has not been repaid. The Council, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend the duration of the post programme surveillance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no budgetary implications."

Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary are the result of a compromise negotiated between the European Parliament and the Council. Under the compromise, the amendments to Articles 1 and 18 of the Agreement on establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which extends the geographic scope of EBRD operations have been approved on behalf of the European Union. Role of the Governor : as part of the annual report to the European Parliament, the Governor of the EBRD representing the Union shall also report on the EBRD's activities and operations in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. Transition : in the recitals, it is highlighted that the expansion of EBRD operations to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean reflects support by the Union and the international community for the hope, encouraged by the Arab Spring, for a transition in that region towards market economies and pluralistic democratic societies. Bearing in mind the fragility of the economies in the EBRD's new countries of operation and the social inequalities which were one of the root causes of the turmoil of the Arab Spring, the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should encourage the EBRD to: broaden its focus on private-sector development , in order also to contribute, through its financing, to the achievement of socially and environmentally sustainable societies, as elaborated in the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and in line with Article 3(5) and Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union; contribute to the transition towards energy-efficient, socially inclusive, open market economies while taking into account the social, poverty, civil and human rights context. Monitoring operations : the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should use their best endeavours to encourage the EBRD to monitor its operations closely, particularly in countries where there is a lack of political accountability, where civil and human rights are infringed or where high levels of corruption persist. Furthermore, the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should use their best endeavours to ensure that the principles of prudential banking, transparency and anti-fraud are taken into account in the activities of the EBRD in the new countries of operation. Approval of new countries : before the EBRD approves a potential new country of operation, it should make a detailed technical assessment of the economic and political conditions existing in the country concerned, including: an assessment of that country's commitment to principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics, as enshrined in Article 1 of the Agreement, an assessment of transition gaps, and a review of activities of other international financing institutions in that country and of the priorities in relation to which the EBRD could best make use of its unique knowledge and skills. In discussing those assessments, the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should encourage the EBRD to take full account of the views of the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The objective of this proposal is to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1300/2008 establishing a multi-annual plan for the stock of herring distributed to the west of Scotland and the fisheries exploiting that stock. This act was adopted prior to the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Plan has as its core objective to ensure the exploitation of the herring stock in the area west of Scotland on the basis of maximum sustainable yield. Science may evolve and improve, and the Plan needs to contain the necessary provisions to ensure it is kept up to date with the best science available. Thus, Article 7 of the Regulation stipulates that if it appears that the fishing mortality rates and associated spawning stock biomass levels used for the purposes of the Plan are no longer appropriate in light of scientific advice, the Council must revise such parameters so as to ensure that the plan can attain its management objectives. The current text therefore confers the power to amend these non-essential elements of the Plan on the Council. Such decision-making procedure is no longer possible under the TFEU. Similarly, Article 8 provides for modification by the Council of certain elements of the plan (including the biological reference levels) and for adoption by the Council of measures alternative or additional to the plan. By way of consequence, the decision-making procedure foreseen in Article 7 and 8 of the Regulation should be converted into a system of delegated powers to be exercised by the Commission under the conditions set out in the Plan itself and where the analysis has shown that the currently envisaged procedures may be qualified as delegated powers in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU. The Plan should therefore be amended accordingly. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. . BACKGROUND: Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (the Seveso II directive) is aimed at preventing major accidents involving large quantities of dangerous substances (or mixtures thereof) as listed in its Annex I and to limit the consequences of such accidents for man and the environment. The Directive, which applies to around 10 000 establishments in the EU, has contributed to reducing the probability and consequences of such accidents and increasing the level of protection in the Union. It must, however, be amended due to changes in the EU system of classification of dangerous substances to which the Directive refers. The review process, which was launched in 2008, revealed that that overall the existing provisions are fit for purpose and that no major changes are required. However, a number of areas were identified where limited amendments would be appropriate in order to clarify and update certain provisions and to improve implementation and enforceability while maintaining or slightly increasing the level of protection for health and environment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main problems covered in the impact assessment related to the alignment of Annex I to Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (the CLP Regulation) and the impact on the scope of the Directive, which was the key issue. Other issues related to information to the public and information management systems and land-use planning, and other detailed provisions which could usefully be clarified or updated. · As regards the alignment of Annex I, the Commission is proposing the option that, in addition to a very limited impact on scope shared with other options, maintains a high level of protection taking into account the most likely and relevant exposure routes in the event of a major accident. To deal with situations arising over time from the alignment where substances are included/excluded under the Directive that do/do not present a major-accident hazard, a package of corrective mechanisms to adapt Annex I via delegated acts is proposed. · As regards information to the public, etc, it is proposed to improve the level and quality of information and how this is collected, managed, made available, updated and shared in an efficient and streamlined way. LEGAL BASE: Article 192(1) (protection of the environment) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main reason for the revision of the Seveso II Directive is to align its Annex I to Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of dangerous substances and mixtures ( the CLP Regulation), which amends and repeals Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC to which the Seveso II Directive currently refers. The CLP rules become definitive with effect from 1 June 2015. The main changes relate to health hazards . The former category ""Very Toxic"" has been aligned to the CLP category ""Acute Toxic 1"" and ""Toxic"" to ""Acute Toxic 2"" (all exposure routes) and ""Acute Toxic 3"" (dermal and inhalation routes.) Several more specific CLP categories for physical hazards that did not exist before replace the more general old categories for oxidizing, explosive, and flammable hazards. For the new category of flammable aerosols, the thresholds have been adapted proportionately to those that apply currently based on their flammable properties and components; and for reasons of consistency, the group of pyrophoric substances has been completed by the inclusion of pyrophoric solids. The new Annex I Part 2 retains the old Part 1 largely unchanged. The only changes are the following: (i) an updated reference to the CLP Regulation for liquefied flammable gases; (ii) the inclusion of anhydrous ammonia, boron triflouride, and hydrogen sulphide as named substances, previously covered by their hazard categories, to keep their thresholds unchanged; (iii) the inclusion of heavy fuel oil in the entry for petroleum products; (iv) clarifications to the notes in relation to ammonium nitrate; (v) and an update of the toxic equivalency factors for dioxins. Among the excluded areas are the offshore exploration and exploitation of minerals, including hydrocarbons. The Commission will assess the appropriate way to strengthen environmental legislation with provisions that may be necessary to complement existing environmental legislation in relation to pollution control, inspection and accident prevention and management as regards individual offshore installations, ensuring a high level of protection of the environment in such activities. Corresponding legislative proposals will include either extending the scope of existing legislation to offshore oil and gas installations or a stand-alone initiative for such operations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the provisions of Directive 2009/39/EC were originally adopted in 1977. After several amendments, a recast version was adopted in 2009 to include the rules of the new Comitology procedure. The main objective of the Framework Directive was to remove the differences between national laws relating to foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses, thus allowing their free movement and creating fair conditions of competitions. Discussions with Member States and stakeholders have highlighted increasing difficulties for implementing the Framework Directive, in particular in relation to more recent pieces of Union legislation such as the legislation on food supplements, on the addition of vitamins and minerals and other substances to foods and nutrition and health claims. This unclear situation has led also to distortions of trade in the internal market. As foreseen in the Framework Directive, Member States were asked for their views and experience on the implementation of certain provisions of that Directive in order to prepare Commission reports on: (i) the implementation of the notification procedure of the Framework Directive on dietetic foods; (ii) the desirability of special provisions for foods for persons suffering from carbohydrate-metabolism disorders (diabetic foods). As regards foods for diabetic people, the Commission's report concludes that there is no scientific basis on which to develop specific compositional requirements for this category of food and that diabetic people should eat as healthily as possible choosing a diet from a variety of food for normal consumption. Also, the report on the implementation of the notification procedure points out that the category of food regulated under that provision differs significantly between Member States creating as a result market distortions. All abovementioned issues led to the need to consider an in-depth and global revision of the legislation on dietetic foods. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: f our options were assessed taking into account their economic, social and environmental impacts on the various stakeholders and authorities: Option 1 – Repeal all the legislation on dietetic foods (Framework Directive and all the specific Directives adopted under that Framework). Option 2 – Repeal the Framework Directive on dietetic foods but maintain certain of the specific rules adopted under that Framework. Option 3 – Revision of the Framework Directive establishing a positive list of dietetic foods with specific compositional and/or labelling rules. Option 4 – Amending the Framework Directive replacing the notification procedure with a centralised Union prior-authorisation procedure based on a scientific assessment. The Commission proposal follows option 2 - Repeal the Framework Directive on dietetic foods but maintain certain of the specific rules adopted under that Framework. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This Article provides that measures having as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market and which concern inter alia health, safety and consumer protection must takeas a base a high level of protection taking account in particular of any new development based on scientific facts. CONTENT: the proposal revises the legislation on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses covered by Directive 2009/39/EC the so-called ""Framework Directive on dietetic foods"". The proposal abolishes the concept of dietetic foods and provides for a new framework establishing general provisions only for a limited number of well-established and defined categories of food that are considered as essential for certain vulnerable groups of the population, i.e. food intended for infants and young children and food for patients under medical supervision. The proposal provides the basis for the assurance of a high level of consumer protection in relation to foods intended for infants and young children and to foods for special medical purposes. It establishes also a single legal measure that regulates the list of substances that can be added to the foods covered by the proposal (Chapter I). Chapters II and III provide for general principles and specific provisions that shall apply to infant formulae and follow-on formulae, processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children and foods for special medical purposes. Chapter IV relates to the establishment of a Union list of substances that can be added to the foods covered by the proposal and provides for a procedure for updating the Union list. Chapter V provides for a general confidentiality clause. Chapter VI and VII concerns all the procedural provisions related to the implementation of the new proposal, the delegation of powers, the procedures, the necessary amendments and the measures that are to be repealed. It specifies also the transitional measures that would apply to the categories of foods currently regulated under Directive 2009/39/EC and the date of entry into force and application. The proposal simplifies and clarifies legal requirements applying to certain categories of foods and establishes a single list of substances that may be added to the foods ('Union list') covered by this proposal. In particular, it: provides a new general Framework legislation applying to well-defined categories of foods that have been identified as essential for certain well-established groups of consumers with specific nutritional needs; establishes a clear and defined scope of application; maintains specific measures for categories of foods that are essential for certain groups of the population; lays down general rules as regards the composition and labelling applying to these categories of foods; removes differences in interpretation and difficulties for Member States and operators in applying different pieces of food legislation by simplifying the regulatory environment; removes the burdens associated with the notification procedure; ensures that similar products are treated in the same way across the Union; removes rules that have become unnecessary, contradictory and potentially conflicting. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions giving the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as regards the specific compositional and information requirements."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he EU has regulated the installation and use of tachographs since 1970.  The current legislation in place for recording equipment is Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85. Tachographs play a crucial role in checking compliance by professional road transport drivers with the rules on driving time and rest periods. They contribute to improving road safety, drivers’ working conditions and fair competition between road transport companies. A significant share of the vehicles checked by national police or enforcement officers are found to be breaching the social rules. Roughly one fourth of these are found to be breaching tachograph rules. Moreover, there is room to improve further the way in which the (digital) tachograph assists the drivers’ work and supports transport efficiency. Although the introduction of the digital tachograph in vehicles registered after 1 May 2006 has already substantially reduced the administrative burden on the various stakeholders, the annual cost of compliance, estimated to be approximately € 2.7 billion, is still too high. The proposal therefore aims at better enforcement of the social rules and at reducing unnecessary administrative burden, by developing the technical aspects of the tachograph and increasing efficiency. The proposal fits into the policy announced by the Commission in its White Paper on Transport of 28 March 2011. It also contributes to implementation of the Action Plan on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Directive 2010/40/EU on the framework for the deployment of ITS in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy packages were established offering viable policy alternatives for achieving the objectives: Policy Package 1 (PP1) is a technical package aiming simply at improvements of the current tachograph device; Policy Package 2 (PP2) is also a package of technical measures but which would substantially widen the functionalities of the digital tachograph, leading to a new type of digital tachographs; Policy Package 3 (PP3) includes only non-technical measures (such as more trustworthy workshops, making fraud with driver card more difficult, better training of control officers, minimum degree of harmonisation of sanctions, modernised rules on use); Policy Package 4 (PP4) is a combination of technical and system improvement measures (PP2+PP3). The analysis performed suggests that PP4 is the preferred option. T he administrative burden reduction potential of PP4 is €515.5 million, well above the total costs of its full implementation. Therefore the analysis performed suggests that Policy Package 4 should be the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims at amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 with a view to improve the tachograph system. The following main changes will be introduced through the proposed Regulation: Remote communication from the tachograph for control purposes : this measure will give control authorities some basic indications on compliance before stopping the vehicle for a roadside check. Compliant undertakings will avoid unnecessary roadside checks and could thereby benefit from a further reduction of administrative burden. Merge functionalities of driver cards with driving licence : this measure will increase the security of the system as drivers would be less inclined to use their driving licence under fraudulent circumstances. It will also significantly reduce administrative burden. This measure requires minor adaptations of Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on driving licences. Automated recording of precise location through GNSS : this provision will give control authorities more information for checking compliance with social legislation. By using automated recording, it will also help to reduce administrative burden. Integration of digital tachograph in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) : by providing for a harmonised and standardised interface of the tachograph, other ITS applications will have easier access to the data recorded and produced by the digital tachograph. Increase the trustworthiness of workshops : by strengthening the legal framework for the approval of workshops for example with a system of regular and unannounced audits and prevention of conflicts of interest, the trustworthiness of workshops will be increased and the risk of fraud and manipulation reduced. Minimum degree of harmonisation of sanctions : this minimum harmonisation ensures that infringements against the tachograph rules which are classified in EU legislation as ‘very serious infringements’ and as ‘most serious infringements’ will attract the highest category of penalties in national legislation. Training of control officers : the Regulation will require Member States to provide adequate training for their control officers in charge of checking the recording equipment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) infringements and the resulting trade in infringing goods are of growing concern, particularly in a globalised economy. In addition to the economic consequences for industry, the infringing products may pose serious health and safety risks to consumers. Certain instances of detentions by customs authorities of shipments of medicines in transit through the EU, which occurred at the end of 2008, which together with the concerns expressed during the WTO consultations between India and Brazil and the EU, have shown that the relevant EU legislation for intellectual property enforcement by customs authorities could benefit from further clarification to increase legal certainty. In its Communication on a Single Market Act, the Commission recalled that customs authorities should be able to provide greater protection for intellectual-property rights through revised legislation. The Commission developed a new customs action plan to combat IPR infringements for the years 2009-2012. The main elements of the Plan were endorsed by the Council. The review of Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 showed that certain improvements to the legal framework were necessary to strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property rights, as well as to ensure appropriate legal clarity, thereby taking into account developments in the economic, commercial and legal areas. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment report looked at three different options, with a number of sub-options. Option 1: ‘ baseline scenario’, where the Commission would take no action and the status quo was maintained. Option 2 : this provided for certain non-legislative measures, where the Commission would propose training initiatives and the development of guidelines and exchange of best practises; Option 3: the Commission proposes amendments to the existing legal framework. Under this option different sub-options could be available for each of the i problems: Sub-option 1 provided for the extension of the possible types of infringements to rights already covered by the current Regulation, for example, as regards goods involving any infringement of trade mark rights, not just counterfeiting. Sub-option 2 included sub-option 1 and extended the current scope of the Regulation in terms of IPR covered. The impact assessment concluded that the best suitable solution would be to amend the Regulation to respond to all the problems identified and to ensure a balanced outcome for all categories of persons affected. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides powers to adopt measures for implementing the common commercial policy. The Regulation concerns the commercial aspects of intellectual property rights in that it deals with measures enabling customs to enforce intellectual property rights at the border on goods that are internationally traded. CONTENT: the draft Regulation sets out the conditions and procedures for action by the customs authorities where goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right are, or should have been, subject to customs supervision within the customs territory of the Union. The main points are as follows: Strengthening enforcement : it is proposed to broaden the scope covered by Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003, by including trade names, topographies of semiconductor products and utility models. It is also proposed to widen the scope of the Regulation by including infringements resulting from parallel trade and devices to circumvent technological measures, as well as other infringements of rights already enforced by customs. The new Regulation would maintain the ability for customs to control for the purpose of enforcement of intellectual property rights, in all situations where the goods were under their supervision and the distinction between the procedural nature of the legislation and substantive law on intellectual property would be emphasised. Destruction of goods : the proposal also introduces procedures enabling customs, under certain conditions, to have goods abandoned for destruction without having to undergo formal and costly legal proceedings. These would be differentiated according to the type of infringement. for counterfeit and pirated goods, the agreement of the owner to destroy the goods could be presumed if the destruction had not been explicitly opposed, whereas for other situations, the owner of the goods would have to agree explicitly to their destruction; in a case where no agreement is reached, the right-holder would have to initiate legal proceedings to establish the infringement, otherwise the goods will be released. A specific procedure is also proposed for small consignments of suspected counterfeit and pirated goods covered by an application, which would allow for goods to be destroyed without the involvement of the right- holder. Protection of the interests of legitimate traders : additional provisions are proposed to ensure the protection of the interests of legitimate traders from possible abuse of the customs enforcement procedures and to integrate the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Regulation. To this end, the proposal clarifies the timelines for detaining suspected goods, the conditions in which information about consignments would be passed on to right-holders by customs, the conditions for applying the procedure allowing for destruction of the goods under customs control for suspected infringements of intellectual property rights other than for counterfeiting and piracy, and the right of defence. Costs of storage and destruction of goods : the draft Regulation continues to provide that storage and destruction costs directly incurred by customs be assumed by the right-holders requesting customs action, though this would not preclude them from taking legal action to recover such costs from the primary liable party. However, it is proposed to introduce an important exception for small consignments, for which storage and destruction costs would be assumed by customs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment is not needed since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. The amendments aiming at simplification are of limited scope and purely technical nature. LEGAL BASE: Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal identifies the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and establishes the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts. In addition, it makes the following points: Simplification : in the light of the experience gained with the application of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 some of the provisions of that Regulation will be simplified, particularly regarding cross compliance requirements. Definitions :for reasons of legal certainty and clarity the proposal provides definitions of 'arable land', 'permanent crops', 'permanent pasture' and 'grassland'. Declaration : the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States not to require the declaration of all the agricultural areas of their holding for farmers with a total area of the holding lower than 1 hectare. It can be assumed that the proposed possibility for Member States to exempt farmers not applying for area-related payments and declaring less than 1 hectare from the requirement of an area declaration will mainly concern livestock producers without any eligible land to apply for area-related payments. The number of farmers which could be affected is difficult to foresee, but it can be assumed that it will be limited, keeping in mind the continued decoupling of livestock payments and transfer to area related payments. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 43 of the TFEU. CONTENT: this proposal aims to identify the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 and establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts. Pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty , the proposal allows the Commission to adopt delegated acts in order to: adopt exceptions to the rule that no rural development support should be granted to schemes eligible for support under common market organisations; adopt detailed conditions concerning all the measures and technical assistance in order to ensure their coherent application in line with the requirements of EU policy, priorities and law; make detailed rules for reductions and exclusions; define a flexibility threshold for each axis; define detailed rules for forms of support other than non-repayable direct assistance; The Commission shall fix detailed control rules and adopt specific transitional measures. In accordance with Article 291 of the Treaty Member States are responsible for implementing the regime established by the Legislator. However, it seems necessary to ensure uniform implementation of the scheme in Member States in order to avoid distortions of competition or discrimination between operators. Therefore, the Legislator gives the Commission powers of enforcement as regards: the uniform conditions for the presentation of rural development programmes; programme approval; approval of revision of programmes; determination of changes requiring approval by Commission decision; longer commitment periods; specific provisions on designation of areas; the establishment and operation of the national rural network; presentation of specific annual reports; a general framework of controls and a common monitoring and evaluation framework that Member states Shall implement. Additionally, some elements of simplification are introduced: Reduction of the number of summary reports and simplification of their content under strategic monitoring: a s part of the simplification exercise of the CAP Member States wanted a reduction in the number of reports to the Commission. In addition to annual progress reports, Member States are required to submit to the Commission summary reports setting out the progress made in implementing their national strategy plans and objectives and their contribution to the achievement of the Community strategic guidelines. Under the current rules, these summary reports are to be submitted each second year, starting from 2010 and ending in 2014, i.e. altogether three reports. The proposal will limit the number of reports to two, the first one to be submitted in 2010 and the second one in 2015, the former in the context of mid-term evaluation and the latter of ex post evaluation. In addition, the report is required to summarise the previous year's annual progress reports. This requirement should be dropped, as it duplicates work. The number of Commission reports summarising the main developments, trends and challenges relating to the implementation of the national strategy plans and the Community strategic guidelines will bw reduced to two, one in 2011 and the second one in 2016. Extension of the coverage of the measure for producer groups: the current provision on support for producer groups, which is already available for all sectors in the new Member States, should be extended to also cover EU-15. However, there will be support for producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector as their activities may be supported under the single CMO. Facilitating more tailor-made use of the advisory services: Mem ber States had proposed changing the rules for use of advisory services. Currently the rules require that, as a minimum, the advisory service to farmers should cover the statutory management requirements and the good agricultural and environmental conditions under cross-compliance as well as the occupational safety standards based on Union legislation. In order to facilitate more tailor-made use of the advisory services and to reflect the individual needs of the beneficiary, the advisory service provided will not need to cover all the aspects listed, but one or more of them. Continuous linear features and stepping stones: a ccording to Article 10 of the Habitats Directive, Member States shall endeavour, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora. Such features are those which, by virtue of their linear and continuous structure (such as rivers with their banks or the traditional systems for marking field boundaries) or their function as stepping stones (such as ponds or small woods), are essential for the migration, dispersal and genetic exchange of wild species. These areas can play an important role for the coherence of Natura 2000 areas and relevant provisions should be included in order to allow Natura 2000 payments for these nationally delimited nature protection areas if sufficient justification is provided linking them to Article 10 of the Habitats Directive. In order to ensure that payments continue to be primarily used for the designated Natura 2000 sites, it is proposed to limit their proportion compared to the Natura 2000 areas. However, this provision is without prejudice to the endeavours of Member States under the Habitats Directive related to encouraging the management of landscape features which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora and does not prejudice the question of what constitutes an adequate implementation of Article 10 of the Habitats Directive. Follow up of non-compliances of the cross-compliance: Member State can decide to consider a case of non-compliance as minor or not to apply a reduction or exclusion where the amount concerned is less than EUR 100. Currently, the competent control authority should ensure that the farmer remedies the findings of the non-compliance concerned. However, with a view to simplification and in order to ease the administrative burden, consideration should be given to simplifying the follow-up checks system. Introducing incentive element for measures falling under Article 43 of the Treaty: i n order to be compatible with the common market, any aid measure must contain some incentive element or require some counterpart on the part of the beneficiary. Aid which is granted retroactively in respect of activities which have already been undertaken by the beneficiary cannot be considered to contain the necessary incentive element. However, for co-financed Rural Development measures approved under Article 43 of the Treaty, there is currently no requirement for an incentive effect laid down in the Union legislation, except in the case of top-ups to which agricultural state aid rules apply. Therefore, retroactive granting of aid should also be prohibited for co-financed agricultural measures and a starting date of eligibility should be provided. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 42, first subparagraph and Article 43(2) TFEU. CONTENT: Articles 290 and 291 TFEU establish a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts and, on the other, the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts: Article 290 TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as delegated acts; Article 291 TFEU requires Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to as implementing acts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no need for an impact assessment since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to align Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to the new requirements of Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. The proposal is based on a careful qualification of the existing Commission powers under Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as ""delegated"" and ""implementing"". This was done against the background of the implementing measures adopted by the Commission on the basis of its current powers. With regard to Article 290 TFEU , a Commission delegated act may determine the additional elements necessary for the proper functioning of the common market organisation established by the Legislator. For example, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in order to lay down the conditions for operators for taking part in a scheme, the obligations deriving from the issue of a licence and, if necessary depending on the economic situation, whether it requires a guarantee for issue of licences. Similarly, the Legislator delegates to the Commission the power to adopt measures to establish eligibility criteria for products as regards market intervention. In addition, the Commission may adopt delegated acts regarding definitions. With regard to Article 291 TFEU , the proposal specifies that in order to ensure that the CMO is implemented in Member States in a uniform manner and to avoid unfair competition or discrimination between operators, the Commission will be able to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 291(2) of the Treaty. The Commission will, therefore, be granted implementing powers under that provision, in particular as regards the uniform conditions under which market intervention measures apply, the uniform conditions for implementing aid schemes and for applying rules concerning marketing and production, and rules related to trade with Third countries. The Commission should also define the minimum characteristics for checks which Member States must apply. In this proposal, the Commission also deals with Council powers under Article 43(3) TFEU. This provision stipulates that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aids and quantitative limitations. The provision forms an exception to Article 43(2) TFEU which requires the ordinary legislative procedure to be used to establish the common organisation of agricultural markets and the other provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common agricultural policy. This reflects the general trend in the Lisbon Treaty which has turned the ordinary legislative procedure into the standard procedure for the adoption of EU legislative acts. As an exception Article 43(3) TFEU needs to be interpreted restrictively so as to ensure that the Legislator can exercise its legislative prerogatives under Article 43(2) TFEU. This includes the Legislator regulating the fundamental elements of the common agricultural policy and taking the political decisions that shape its structure, instruments and effects. Against this background the specific procedure laid down in Art. 43(3) TFEU should only be applied where an issue referred to in that provision does not form part of the fundamental policy decisions reserved to the Legislator under Article 43(2) TFEU. Therefore, where such an issue is inextricably linked with the political substance of the decisions to be taken by the Legislator, Article 43(3) TFEU should not be applied. Consequently, the proposal is based on the following principles: the structural parameters and fundamental elements of the CAP may only be decided by the Legislator. For example, the public intervention (including the framework for the determination by the Commission of certain intervention prices by means of the tendering procedure) and milk and sugar quota schemes established by Regulation 1234/2007 should be decided by the Legislator, as these elements are inextricably linked to the definition of the content of the scheme established by the Legislator and the boundaries of this regime; measures on fixing prices, levies, aids and quantitative limitations as referred to in Article 43(3) which do not fall in the scope of Article 43(2) TFEU shall be taken by the Council. The Commission will submit a proposal for a Regulation based on Article 43(3) TFEU as regards the provisions in Article 21 on the conditions for mandatory aid for private storage of butter, in Article 99 on the production refund in the sugar sector, in Articles 101 and 102 on aids in the milk and milk products sector, in Article 108 on the supply of milk products to pupils, in Article 155 on aids in the silkworm sector, in Article 273 on export refunds and in Article 281 on live plants minimum export prices. The proposed Regulations will, in respect of these provisions, provide that the conditions for fixing of aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should be determined by the Council under Article 43(3) TFEU and that amounts of such aids, refunds and price levels should be fixed by the Commission by means of implementing acts. The Commission will submit the proposals that need to be made with regard to Article 43(3) TFEU in due course to the Council. Lastly, the content of the following proposals is integrated into this proposal: European Parliament legislative resolution of 23 November on the proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation) as regards the aid granted in the framework of the German Alcohol Monopoly; proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007, as regards distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union; proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards marketing standards; proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013 ; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers. The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in view of the application of the direct payments regulation as from 1 January 2014, this regulation sets net ceilings for direct payments for the calendar year 2013 by establishing an adjustment mechanism similar to modulation so as to ensure continuity in payment levels while taking into account the phasing in of new Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates – a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges – are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (at the request of the Court of Justice of the EU.) LEGAL BASIS : Article 257 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 106(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community; Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and in particular Article 62c thereof and Article 2(2) of Annex I thereto. BACKGROUND: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature a proposal for amendments to the Statute of the Court and Annex I thereto. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. The European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. In accordance with Article 62c of the Statute, as thus amended, the actual attachment of temporary Judges to the Civil Service Tribunal requires an amendment to Annex I [1] to the Statute. CONTENT: at the Court of Justice’s request, this proposal aims to lay down the rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges of the Tribunal, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties. This draft Regulation is linked to the draft amendments to the Statute of the Court and Annex I thereto. on a proposal from the President of the Court of Justice, the Council of the European Union shall draw up a list of three persons to be temporary Judges. Temporary Judges shall be chosen from among former Members of the Court of Justice of the European Union who are able to place themselves at the disposal of the Civil Service Tribunal. Temporary Judges shall be appointed for a period of four years and may be reappointed; the Civil Service Tribunal may decide to avail itself of the assistance of a temporary Judge if it determines that a Judge is or will be prevented, on medical grounds, from participating in judicial business and that the situation will be or is likely to be of at least three months’ duration, and if it takes the view that that Judge is nevertheless not suffering from disablement deemed to be total. In this case, the President of the Tribunal shall call upon a temporary Judge to undertake judicial duties; temporary Judges who are called upon to take up their duties shall exercise the prerogatives of a Judge solely in the context of dealing with cases to which they are assigned. This implies that temporary Judges would be able to perform only strictly judicial duties and would not be entitled to participate in the administration of the Civil Service Tribunal or in the election of the President of the Tribunal or Presidents of Chambers; with regard to emoluments, the proposal provides that temporary Judges shall receive remuneration of an amount equal to 1/30th of the basic monthly salary allocated to Judges under Article 21c(2) of Regulation No 422/67/EEC and No 5/67/Euratom for each day. Temporary Judges would also be entitled to reimbursement of their travel and hotel expenses, as well as to payment of a daily subsistence allowance, in respect of journeys to Luxembourg in the course of their duties. The amount by which the remuneration together with the pension provided for in Article 8 of Regulation No 422/67/EEC and No 5/67/Euratom exceeds the remuneration, before deduction of taxes, which the temporary Judge was receiving as a member of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be deducted from that pension; lastly, the draft regulation sets out the circumstances under which the duties of temporary judges will cease. This will take place on his death or resignation, or by decision to deprive him of his office as provided by the Statute. The duties of a temporary Judge shall also end when the Judge whom he has replaced is no longer prevented from acting."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: due to fiscal austerity in the Member States, there is a danger that infrastructure projects of EU interest are not carried out at the pace required to achieve Europe 2020 objectives thereby compromising the EU's economic recovery and growth. Innovative solutions are urgently required to mobilise a greater share of private savings and to improve the range of financial instruments available for infrastructure projects, especially in the energy, transport and ICT sectors. The norm for infrastructure projects with commercial potential should be to combine EU funds in partnerships with the capital market and banking sectors, particularly via the European Investment Bank (EIB). In its resolution of 8 June 2011, the European Parliament underlined that the Union should take action notably to enhance the use of the Union funds as a catalyst for attracting additional financing from the European Investment Bank (EIB), European Bank for Reconstruction and development (EBRD), other international financial institutions and the private sector. On 29 June 2011, the European Commission adopted its proposal for the multi-annual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020. One of the key decisions was to bring the granting of financial aid for transport, energy and ICT infrastructure into a common legislative framework, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The mechanism will provide a longer term framework enabling the creation and implementation, in a timely and efficient manner, of projects in the fields of energy, transport and telecommunications. The Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative will become an integral part of the risk-sharing instruments of the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2014-2020. The main objective of the pilot phase in 2012-2013 is to prepare the operational phase of the initiative under the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2014-2020 and to provide immediate support for infrastructure projects. In order to allow a more efficient implementation of the financial instruments under the Connecting Europe Facility, the launch of a pilot phase is required, both to allow the optimisation of the design and stimulate investor appetite for the post-2013 period. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment reviews the current market situation with a link to the impact assessment accompanying the proposal for the CEF which includes more background on the potential CEF instruments, financing gaps and market imperfections affecting current levels of investment in infrastructure. Three options were analysed: i) the status quo, i.e. continuing with current grant programmes for energy and transport and the current grant programmes and financial instruments for transport; ii) regulatory incentives and iii) the proposal to implement the Project Bond Initiative. In this context, the potential risks hindering the implementation of the Initiative have been reviewed and a quantifiable expected impact revealed in terms of a multiplier effect. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 172 and 173 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is proposing To launch a pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative in the area of transport, energy and ICT. This initiative seeks to mobilise investment in areas that will stimulate growth and create jobs. The Initiative aims to provide the credit enhancement required to attract capital market investors and would facilitate the creation of a new asset class in terms of infrastructure project bonds. The initiative will complement, rather than replace bank lending and thus provide an alternative and competitive source of long-term debt finance to infrastructure projects. To have the maximum impact, the initiative could also be applied to projects at an advanced stage of the bidding process for the purposes of refinancing during or shortly after the end of the construction period. In the pilot phase, the Commission would work in particular with the EIB to optimise the design of the initiative for optimal implementation from 2014 onwards. Budgetary funds should be requested by the EIB on the basis of a range of projects, which the EIB would deem suitable and likely to be realised. Any such requests should be made prior to 31 December 2013. Due to the complexity of large infrastructure projects, the actual approval might take place at a later date, but no later than 31 December 2014. In order to implement the pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, Decision No 1639/2006/EC establishing the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP)and Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 laying down the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks should be amended. Given the short time available, the Commission invites the Parliament and the Council to adopt the proposal for a pilot phase as speedily as possible. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the total budget available from the EU for the pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative is EUR 230 million. The initiative will be entirely financed by redeployment within the envelopes of existing programmes in 2012 and 2013. The following redeployments could be made in favour of the initiative: up to EUR 200 million from the TEN-T (transport) budget, up to EUR 20 million from the budget of the framework programme for innovation and competitiveness in order to allow the financing of projects in the field of ICT and in particular broadband, and an amount of up to EUR 10 million from the TEN-E (energy) budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: energy efficiency is one of the key features of the flagship initiative “ A resource-efficient Europe ” announced in the Europe 2020 strategy. Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and fastest way to increase security of supply, and is an effective way to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions responsible for climate change. As outlined in the Commission Communication “ A Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 ”, energy efficiency can help the EU achieve and even outperform its greenhouse gas emission reduction target. The EU has set itself the objective of achieving 20% primary energy savings in 2020. The Commission’s latest estimations suggest that the EU will achieve only half of the 20% target in 2020. The current framework which governs energy efficiency, in particular Directive 2006/32/EC on energy services and Directive 2004/8/EC on cogeneration, has failed to fully tap the energy saving potential. The measures already adopted at Member State level are also insufficient to overcome the remaining obstacles on markets and in regulation. The European Council and the European Parliament have called on the Commission to adopt a new ambitious strategy in the area of energy efficiency for determined action to tap the considerable potential. To give fresh momentum to energy efficiency, on 8 March 2011 the Commission put forward a new Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) setting out measures to achieve further savings in energy supply and use. This legislative proposal transforms certain aspects of the EEP into binding measures. It also looks beyond the 20% target and seeks to set a common framework to promote energy efficiency in the Union beyond 2020. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment explores a series of options broken down into three levels: First-level policy options analyse ways to improve the current policy framework. This analysis focuses primarily on issues of whether the current approach of the ESD to target setting should be extended until 2020, whether national energy savings targets should be added to achieve the EU 20 % target and if so, whether they should be binding or merely indicative. The analysis concludes that the ESD targets should be maintained for end-use sectors until their deadline in 2016, but to reach the 20 % energy efficiency target they need to be complemented with more ambitious energy savings targets under the Europe 2020 process. Second-level policy options explore different measures to tackle the remaining economic potential on the demand and supply side. The IA looks at energy savings obligation schemes as a possible option for yielding energy savings in end-use sectors. Another set of policy options examine measures involving the public sector. Other options with a considerable positive impact compared to their costs are those that aim to promote the energy services market, provide improved and more frequent information to households and companies on their actual energy consumption through billing and smart meters, and mandatory energy audits for large companies. Other options to promote energy efficiency via voluntary measures are assessed as insufficient to tap all the available potential for savings. The IA also analyses which measures could help tap energy efficiency potential in energy transformation and distribution, as well as options for national reporting and monitoring of implementation. Third-level policy options assess the legal form of the selected first- and second-level measures. It concludes that, in order to reach the level of ambition of the EU 20% energy efficiency target, EU policies need to reap the energy saving potential in every sector, including in those sectors excluded from the scope of the ESD. This is why it is proposed to adopt a new legislative proposal that covers the scope of the two Directives and extends it to all sectors with energy saving potential. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive establishes a common framework for promoting energy efficiency in the Union to ensure the target of 20 % primary energy savings by 2020 is met and to pave the way for further energy efficiency afterwards. It lays down rules designed to remove barriers and overcome some of the market failures that impede efficiency in the supply and use of energy. End-use sectors : the proposed Directive focuses on measures that lay down requirements on the public sector, both as regards renovating the buildings it owns and applying high energy efficiency standards to the purchase of buildings, products and services. requires Member States to establish national energy efficiency obligation schemes; requires regular mandatory energy audits for large companies and lays down a series of requirements on energy companies regarding metering and billing. Energy supply sector : the proposal requires Member States: to adopt national heating and cooling plans to develop the potential for high-efficiency generation and efficient district heating and cooling, and to ensure that spatial planning regulations are in line with these plans; to adopt authorisation criteria that ensure that installations are located in sites close to heat demand points and that all new electricity generation installations and existing installations that are substantially refurbished are equipped with high-efficiency CHP units. Member States should however be able to lay down conditions for exemption from this obligation where certain conditions are met; to establish an inventory of energy efficiency data for installations undertaking the combustion of fuels or the refining of mineral oil and gas. The proposal also sets requirements on priority/guaranteed access to the grid, priority dispatch of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration and the connection of new industrial plants producing waste heat to district or cooling networks. Other measures proposed include efficiency requirements for national energy regulatory authorities, information and awareness-raising actions, requirements concerning the availability of certification schemes, action to promote the development of energy services, and an obligation for Member States to remove obstacles to energy efficiency, notably the split of incentives between the owner and tenant of a building or among building owners. Lastly, the proposal provides for the establishment of national energy efficiency targets for 2020 and requires the Commission to assess in 2014 whether the Union can achieve its target of 20% primary energy savings by 2020. The Commission is required to submit its assessment to the European Parliament and the Council, followed, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal laying down mandatory national targets. It should be noted that the scope of two Directives: the Cogeneration Directive (2004/8/EC, CHP Directive) and the Energy Services Directive (2006/32/EC, ESD) overlap with this proposal. It is therefore proposed that these two Directives are repealed when the new Directive enters into force, except for Articles 4(1) to (4) and Annexes I, III and IV to the ESD. These provisions concern the achievement by 2017 of an indicative energy saving target of 9% of the final energy consumption of each Member State in the 5 years before the implementation of the ESD. This target – albeit different in scope and level of ambition - contributes to the realisation of the EU's 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, and should therefore remain applicable until 2017. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Directive will be implemented using the existing budget and will not have an impact on the multi-annual financial framework. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions giving the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: s tandards and standardisation are very effective policy tools for the EU. They are used as policy instruments to ensure, inter alia, the functioning of the single market of products, the interoperability of networks and systems, in particular in the field of ICT, a high level of consumer and environmental protection, and more innovation and social inclusion. This proposal addresses three major problems: 1. In a rapidly changing world and society, especially in sectors characterised by very short product lives and development cycles, standards must keep pace with rapid technological development. Some stakeholders argue that the entire process of creating European standards developed at the request of the Commission is too slow. 2. SMEs encounter a series of problems with respect to standards and standardisation. One of the most important problems, according to many stakeholders, is that SMEs are in general under-represented in standardisation activities, in particular at European level. 3. In the field of ICT, many standards ensuring interoperability are not elaborated by the ESOs but by other organisations that develop standards (hereinafter ""global fora and consortia""). Concrete examples are Internet and World Wide Web related standards. At the moment, referring to ""Fora and Consortia Standards"" in public procurement which is subject to Directive 2004/18/CE is only possible in exceptional circumstances. To respond rapidly to evolving needs in all areas, a comprehensive, inclusive, efficient and technically up-to-date European standardisation system will be required. In its Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the Commission highlighted the necessity to improve the method of standard setting and the use of standards in Europe. On 21 October 2010, the European Parliament adopted a report on the future of European standardisation which indicated that the review of European standardisation should preserve its many successful elements, remedy its deficiencies and strike the right balance between the European, national and international dimensions. In its communication of 13 April 2011 on the ‘Single market Act: Twelve levers to boost growth and confidence', the Commission included among its twelve key priority actions to be adopted by the EU institutions before the end of 2012 the extension of the European standardisation system to services. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission accepted a combination of different options: Options 1.A (deadlines on the delivery of European standards) and 1.C (transparent and simplified procedures for harmonised standards and other European standards requested by the Commission), Option 2.C (strengthen the position of organisations representing SMEs and societal stakeholders within the ESOs by providing for the possibility of an operating grant) and 3.B (referencing of ""Fora and Consortia Standards"" in public procurement) meet the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and consistency. Therefore, these 4 options constitute the basis of this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t his proposal replaces a part of Directive 98/34/EC and repeals Decisions No 1673/2006/EC and 87/95/EEC. It aims to establish rules with regard to: (i) the cooperation between European standardisation bodies, national standardisation bodies and the Commission; (ii) the establishment of European standards and European standardisation deliverables for products and for services in support of Union legislation and policies; (iii) the recognition of technical specifications in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT) and; (iv) financing of European standardisation. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Enhanced cooperation : the cooperation between national standardisation bodies will become more transparent. International standards : the use of standards developed by other organisations in the field of information and communication technologies will be possible in public procurement, provided that these standards comply with a set of criteria based on the WTO principles for international standardisation processes, in domains where there are no European standards, where European standards have not gained market uptake or where these standards have become obsolete. Planning : the planning will be improved: the Commission will establish an annual Work Programme, which will identify priorities for European standardisation and the mandates required. Representation of SMEs : SMEs and societal stakeholders should be better represented in European standardisation, and the financial support to organisations representing SMEs and societal stakeholders will be ensured. Simplification : a reduction of the administrative burden imposed on the Commission and the ESOs, for example by the possibility of a robust simplification of lump sums, clearly disconnected from any verification of actual costs of implementation. This proposal constitutes a further shift towards a performance-based system, based on the definition of agreed indicators and objectives (outputs and outcomes). Service standards : although European standards are already widely used for transport and logistics, postal services and electronic communications networks and services, the voluntary European standards have played a less prominent role in supporting the completion of the single market for services. This proposal therefore includes service standards within its scope in order to enable the Commission to issue mandates requesting the development of European service standards and to finance a part of the cost of this development. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal relates to the extension of an existing action. It should be noted that the amounts set out in this legislative financial statement do not prejudice the forthcoming Commission proposal for the post-2013 multi-annual financial framework. Budgetary appropriations allocated to this action will be proposed by the Commission in the annual budgetary procedure. Consequently, this financial statement is limited to one year (2013). The implication on operational appropriations is estimated at EUR 27 million in commitment appropriations. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in December 2010, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 (""2010 pharmacovigilance legislation"") amending respectively, as regards pharmacovigilance, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The new legislation will apply from July 2012. These measures have substantially strengthened the legal framework for the surveillance of medicinal products, with provisions to reinforce the coordinating role of the Agency, the possibilities for signal detection, and the operation of coordinated procedures at European level to respond to safety concerns. However, recent pharmacovigilance events in the European Union, in particular the “Mediator case”, have shown the need for a further improvement of the pharmacovigilance system. Following an analysis of the Mediator case in the light of the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation (""Stress test""), the Commission has detected certain weaknesses in the pharmacovigilance system that need to be addressed. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 and Article 168(4)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the general policy objectives of the proposals to amend Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medicinal products for human use and to protect better the health of EU citizens. Following this line, the proposals aim specifically to address weaknesses identified in the EU pharmacovigilance system and provide for more transparency and efficiency of the system in cases where safety concerns are identified. The main amendments to the Regulation are as follows: Automatic assessment at EU level : Directive 2001/83/EC provides for an automatic assessment at Union level when specific serious safety issues have been identified with regard to nationally authorised products. In the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation, changes to the Commission's proposal during co-decision have led to the automatic assessment being lost, as the initiation of the procedure is linked to an appreciation by the Member State or the Commission as to whether an urgent action is considered necessary. Thus, when a Member State considers suspending, revoking or refusing renewal of a marketing authorisation, but does not consider that urgent action is needed, no evaluation of the safety concern will be conducted at Union level. Recent pharmacovigilance events in the Union have shown the need for an automatic procedure at Union level in the cases of specific safety issues to ensure that a matter is assessed and addressed in all Member States where the medicinal product is authorised. The scope of different Union procedures concerning nationally authorised products is clarified in the text. Transparency : marketing authorisation holders are not required to declare the reasons for the withdrawal of a marketing authorisation or product. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that voluntary withdrawal of a marketing authorisation or product by the marketing authorisation holder could lead to safety issues being missed, in particular if the company is not transparent about possible safety concerns. Voluntary action by the marketing authorisation holder should not lead to a situation where concerns related to the risks or benefits of a medicinal product authorised in the Union are not properly addressed in all Member States. Therefore, provision is made for the marketing authorisation holder to inform competent authorities of the reasons for the withdrawal of a medicinal product, for interrupting the placing on the market of a medicinal product, for requests for revoking a marketing authorisation, or for not renewing a marketing authorisation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the budget of the Union. It makes minor changes to the system set forth by the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation, and does not require additional human or administrative resources."

Accordingly, provision is made for the marketing authorisation holder to inform the Agency of the reasons for the withdrawal of a medicinal product, for interrupting the placing on the market of a medicinal product, for requests for revoking a marketing authorisation, or for not renewing a marketing authorisation. Transparency : the public list of medicinal product subject to additional monitoring provided for in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will include certain medicinal products subject to post-authorisation safety conditions. Those products will be included in the list, following consultation with the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, only if the Commission or a Member States' competent authorities make a request. Therefore, competent authorities will have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to make public the fact that products are subject to strengthened surveillance. The proposal provides that, in order to ensure transparency on the surveillance of authorised medicinal products, the list of medicinal products subject to additional monitoring established by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should systematically include medicinal products that are subject to post-authorisation safety conditions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the budget of the Union. It makes minor changes to the system set forth by the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation, and does not require additional human or administrative resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he EU actions over the past decades have resulted in a considerable reduction of emissions of most air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds, ammonia and particulate matter (PM). The greatest share of these reductions has been achieved by land-based emission sources such as industrial plants or road transport. Evidence shows that further reduction of such pollutants will deliver significant benefits to the health of EU citizens, the environment, and the economy at large. Projections made in 2005 showed that without further regulatory action the continued growth in emissions of SO2 and NOx from the maritime sector will surpass total emissions of these pollutants from all land-based sources by 2020. Directive 1999/32/EC as amended regulates the sulphur content of fuels used by maritime transport and incorporates certain rules, agreed under the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), into EU law. In particular, the Directive incorporates more stringent rules on sulphur content of marine fuels to be used in areas in need of special environmental protection, the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). Since the amendment of the Directive in 2005, and with strong EU support, IMO rules, among others in relation to SO2, were revised in October 2008. These rules are contained in Annex VI of the Marine Pollution Convention 73/78 (Revised MARPOL Annex VI). The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010. It introduces, inter alia, stricter sulphur limits for marine fuel in SECAs (1.00% as of 1 July 2010 and 0.10% as of 1 January 2015) as well as in sea areas outside SECAs (3.5% as of 1 January 2012 and, in principle, 0.50% as of 1 January 2020). Most Member States are obliged to require ships to use fuel with maximum 1.00% sulphur content in SECAs as of 1 July 2010 based on their international commitments. In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in the Union, the provisions of Directive 1999/32/EC should be aligned with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in its analysis, the Commission: confirms the cost-effectiveness of the full alignment of the Directive with the IMO stricter fuel standards and the rules on emission abatement methods; recommends maintaining the link between the stricter fuel standards in SECAs and those applying for passenger ships on a regular service outside SECAs. However, the introduction of a new SECA standard for passenger ships would be delayed by 5 years in order to avoid potential problems with fuel availability. The benefit to cost ratios for this option range from 1.5 to 6 (if the 0.1% standard is introduced in 2020) and from 0.8 to 10 (if the 0.1% standard is introduced in 2025); suggests to first develop guidance on monitoring and implementation of the Directive and, should this approach fail, to consider adopting binding rules; recommends that the European Commission and Member States use and, where possible and necessary, adapt existing instruments, to assist industry in the transition towards the new best available technology standards. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal is consistent with the EU 2020 Strategy and its associated flagship initiatives, notably those relating to the low carbon society roadmaps and innovation Union , as well as existing EU policies for sustainable transport. The purpose of this proposal is to revise Directive 99/32/EC on the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels with the aim to: (1) align the Directive with the IMO rules on fuel standards, including the standards applicable outside SECAs; (2) align the Directive with the IMO rules on the emission abatement methods; (3) maintain the link between the stricter fuel standards in SECAs (now requiring maximum sulphur content of marine fuel of 1.5% and from 2015 - 0.1%) and those applying for passenger ships on a regular service outside SECAs (at the moment 1.5%); (4) strengthen EU monitoring and enforcement regime. According to the Commission, the main advantages of the proposed Regulation are as follows: incorporating the international fuel standards into EU law would strengthen the effectiveness of these standards as they would be monitored and enforced under the EU regime, which is more effective than the international enforcement system; extended access to and promoting the use of innovate emission abatement methods as an equivalent compliance option addresses concerns about the cost implications resulting from the new IMO rules for certain industries. This would significantly lower the IMO compliance costs (by 50% to 88%) and promote innovative industry solutions, in line with the priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy and Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU); stricter fuel standards for passenger ships on a regular service , which operate mostly in ports or close to shore, would ensure improvement of air quality in coastal areas. The introduction of the stricter fuel standard for passenger ships would be delayed by 5 years in comparison with SECAs in order to avoid potential problems with fuel availability; lastly, strengthening EU monitoring and enforcement regime is particularly important considering that the significantly stricter fuel standards and the associated compliance costs may increase the incentives for circumvention. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) provides for a possibility for the Member States to grant decoupled aid under the Single Payment Scheme to vine-growers. Several Member States have used this possibility, which shows the utility of that measure. This amendment to the current Single CMO regulation provides for the definite transfer of the measure on support to vine-growers to the SPS. Member States must decide by 1 December 2012 with effect from 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: to support cooperation between the national public administrations responsible for the application of Union law, the European Commission has developed the Internal Market Information System (IMI) which is a generic, customisable administrative cooperation platform. Freely available for use by the Member States since 2008, this system provides more than 6 000 registered authorities in the 27 Member States and three EEA countries with a fast and secure communication channel for cross-border information exchange with their counterparts, effectively overcoming barriers due to different languages and administrative structures. IMI is currently used for the exchange of information pursuant to Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications  and Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market. Cross-border administrative cooperation frequently involves processing and exchanging personal data of EU citizens. From a legal point of view, IMI operates on the basis of a Commission decision, a ‘comitology’ decision, and a Commission recommendation. The lack of a single legal instrument adopted by the European Parliament and the Council underlying its operations came to be seen as an obstacle to further expansion of IMI. According to the Commission Communication “Towards a Single Market Act”, extending IMI to other sectors ‘with a view to creating a genuine face-to-face electronic network for European administrations’ is one of the keys to promoting better governance of the single market. The Commission’s communication on expanding and developing the IMI’ (the IMI Strategy Communication) adopted on 21 February 2011 set out plans for future expansion of IMI to other areas of EU law. The Commission Communication “A Single Market Act” stressed the importance of IMI for strengthening cooperation among the actors involved, including at local level, thus contributing to better governance of the single market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal consolidates the current rules governing IMI within a single horizontal legally binding instrument. Consequently, no alternative policy options need to be considered at this stage. For this reason, no impact analysis was undertaken. Any subsequent decisions concerning the expansion of the use of IMI beyond the areas of Union law for which it is currently used will require proportionate impact assessments. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal aims at improving the conditions for the functioning of the internal market by providing an effective and user-friendly tool facilitating the practical implementation of provisions of Union law mandating administrative cooperation and information exchange. The proposal for a Regulation: sets down rules for the use of the IMI system for administrative cooperation. These rules include the obligation to appoint one national IMI coordinator per Member State, the obligation on competent authorities to provide an adequate response in a timely manner and the provision that information exchanged via IMI may be used for providing evidence in the same way as similar information obtained within the same Member State; lays down the basic principles for data protection in the IMI , including the rights of data subjects, in a single legal instrument, thus increasing transparency and enhancing legal certainty. The list of areas of Union acts currently supported by IMI is set out in Annex I, while areas of possible future expansion are listed in Annex II. The procedural and budgetary aspects aimed at facilitating future expansion of IMI are in line with the IMI Strategy Communication. BUDGETARY IMPACT: as the use of IMI is mandatory for Member States under the Services Directive and the recently adopted Directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, it is necessary to ensure that IMI can continue to operate on a permanent basis. For this reason, it is proposed that the expenditure related to IMI be regrouped by bringing all costs under the same budget line managed by DG Internal Market and Services (budget line 12.02.01 Implementation and development of the Internal Market). This proposal does not have a budgetary impact over and above what is already foreseen in the years to come in the official programming of the Commission and it is without prejudice to the decisions on the post-2013 multi-annual financial framework. In 2010, the financing of IMI was covered by the following sources: i) ISA programme (EUR 500 000 – budget line 26.03.01.01) and ii) internal market budget lines (EUR 925 000). For 2011-2012, the planned financing from ISA will amount to ca. EUR 1.15 million per year. The impact on operational expenditure is estimated at EUR 1.44 million in commitment appropriations for the year 2013. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions conferring on the Commission the right to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a legislative package which aims at strengthening the rights of victims in the EU and which also includes the following two other elements: a communication on strengthening victims' rights in the EU and a proposal for a Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters. The European Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, the cornerstone of which is the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and other decisions of judicial authorities taken in civil and criminal matters within the Union. It has already acted on the rights of victims in criminal proceedings through Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. Whilst improvements have been achieved in this area, the objectives of the Council Framework Decision have not been fully realised. The European Parliament has also called upon the Council to adopt a comprehensive legal framework offering victims of crime the widest protection5. In its resolution of 26 November 2009 on the elimination of violence against women, the Parliament called on the Member States to improve their national laws and policies to combat all forms of violence against women and to act in order to tackle the causes of violence against women, not least by employing preventive measures and called on the Union to guarantee the right to assistance, protection and support for all victims of violence. Declaration 19 of the protocols to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also calls on Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent and punish acts of domestic violence and to support and protect the victims of such violence. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Union is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions. Mutual recognition can only operate effectively in a spirit of confidence, whereby not only judicial authorities but all those involved in the criminal justice process and others who have a legitimate interest in it can trust in the adequacy of the rules of each Member State and trust that those rules are correctly applied. Where victims of crime are not subject to the same minimum standards throughout the EU, such trust can be reduced due to concerns over the treatment of victims or due to differences in procedural rules. Common minimum rules should thus lead to increased confidence in the criminal justice systems of all Member States, which in turn should lead to more efficient judicial cooperation in a climate of mutual trust as well as to the promotion of a fundamental rights culture in the European Union. It is for this reason that the Commission is now proposing this legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the European Commission considered five options: retention of the status quo (option 1) and four other policy options (options 2, 3a, 3b and 4). Option 1 – Status Quo : retention of the status quo. No action at EU level. Option 2 – Low level of obligation : least prescriptive option. Imposes minimum obligations on Member States to establish systems or services with minimum detail on what standards should be achieved. When necessary to take legal measures, this option requires the least changes in national procedural laws. Option 3a – Medium level obligation : medium prescriptive option. Imposes medium level of obligation on Member States for all measures to establish services and rights and imposes provisions on what such services should be while defining minimum details on what standards to be applied. The level of obligations on Member States is low and does not require Member States to establish Restorative Justice Services (RJS) but only to ensure that safeguards and minimum quality standards are applied where RJS are used. Option 3b – Medium/High level obligation : medium prescriptive option. Imposes medium level of obligation on Member States for all measures to establish services and rights and imposes provisions on what such services should be while defining minimum details on what standards to be applied. Option 4 – Highest level of obligation : the most prescriptive option. Imposes a range of obligations on Member States to establish services and rights. It also imposes more detailed provisions on what such services should be and the exact standards that should be applied. The impact assessment concluded that it was necessary to replace the 2001 Framework Decision with a new Directive containing concrete obligations on the rights of victims. Option 3a was the preferred option of the Commission. Legislation should be followed with practical measures to facilitate implementation. It would also be a first step in this field with further studies and action envisaged, in particular in relation to compensation of victims and legal aid for victims. LEGAL BASIS: Article 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Directive intends to replace the 2001 Framework Decision with a new Directive containing concrete obligations on the rights of victims. A number of provisions of Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings have been maintained in their original form or have been amended only to the extent necessary for clarity of drafting. The following comments concentrate on those areas which introduce substantive changes to the Framework Decision: Definitions : the purpose of this Directive is to ensure that all victims of crime benefit from minimum standards throughout the EU. In particular, this Directive makes provision for support and protection to be given to family members of victims since such persons are often also harmed by the crime and may themselves be at risk of secondary victimisation as well as victimisation or intimidation by the offender or his associates. All provisions in this Directive are also applicable to family members of a victim whose death has been caused by a criminal offence since such persons have specific and legitimate interests in the proceedings beyond those of family members of surviving victims and are often recognised as representatives of the victim. Information rights and right to understand and to be understood :a series of provisions are provided in order to ensure that victims receive sufficient information in a form they can understand to enable them to fully access their rights and to ensure they feel treated in a respectful manner. Such information should be available from the moment a victim makes a complaint of a criminal offence as well as on a regular basis throughout criminal proceedings and in relation to the progress of the case. Sufficient detail should be provided to enable victims to make informed decisions about their participation in proceedings and how to access their rights, in particular when deciding whether to request a review of the decision not to prosecute. The victim may not understand the language of the information or there may be other factors such as the victim's age, maturity, intellectual and emotional capacities, literacy levels and any disabilities. Right to access victim support services : victims should have access to support services which provide information and advice, emotional and psychological support and practical assistance which are often crucial to the recovery of victims and help them cope with the aftermath of the crime and with the strain of any criminal proceedings. Support should be available from the earliest possible moment after the commission of a crime irrespective of whether it has been reported. Such services can prove particularly important in regard to a victim’s decision to ultimately report a crime. Equally, victims may require support both during the period of any proceedings and in the long term. Support services may be provided by governmental or non-governmental organisations and should not involve excessive procedures and formalities which might reduce effective access to such services. Support may be provided in a variety of ways such as face-to-face meetings, by telephone or other remote means in order to maximise the geographical distribution and availability of services. Certain groups of victims including victims of sexual violence, bias crime such as gender based violence and race hate crime, and victims of terrorism often require specialist support services due to the particular characteristics of the crime they have fallen victim to. Although the provision of support should not be dependent on a victim making a complaint of an offence to the police or other competent authorities, such authorities are often best placed to inform victims of the possibility of support. Member States are therefore encouraged to establish appropriate conditions to enable the referral of victims to victim support services, including by ensuring that data protection requirements can be adhered to. Right to be heard : it is ensured that the victim has an opportunity to provide initial and further information, views or evidence during criminal proceedings. The exact extent of this right is left to national law and may range from basic rights to communicate with and supply evidence to a competent authority through to more extensive rights such as a right to have evidence taken into account, the right to ensure that certain evidence is taken or the right to make interventions during the trial. Rights in the event of a decision not to prosecute : victims should be able to verify that established procedures and rules have been complied with and that a correct decision has been made to end a prosecution in relation to a specific person. Precise mechanisms for a review are left to national law. However, such a review should as a minimum be carried out by a person or authority different to the one that took the original decision not to prosecute. Right to safeguards in the context of mediation and other restorative justice services : restorative justice services encompass a range of services whether attached to, running prior to, in parallel with or after criminal proceedings. They may be available in relation to certain types of crime or only in relation to adult or child offenders and include for example victim offender mediation, family group conferencing and sentencing circles. The proposed Directive ensures that where such services are provided, safeguards are in place to ensure the victim is not further victimised as a result of the process. Such services should therefore have as a primary consideration the interests and needs of the victim, repairing the harm to the victim and avoiding further harm. Participation of the victim should be voluntary which also implies that the victim has sufficient knowledge of the risks and benefits to make an informed choice. It also means that factors such as power imbalances, and the age, maturity or intellectual capacity of the victim which could limit or reduce the victim's ability to make an informed choice or could prejudice a positive outcome for the victim should be taken into consideration in referring a case to and in conducting a restorative process. Whilst private proceedings should in general be confidential, unless agreed otherwise by the parties, factors such as threats made during the process may be considered as requiring disclosure in the public interest. Ultimately any agreement between the parties should be reached voluntarily. Right to reimbursement of expenses : this provision is consistent with the 2001 Framework Decision in providing to victims who participate in criminal proceedings the right to reimbursement of expenses. It also provides for reimbursement where the victim attends the trial without participating in the proceedings as such. The purpose is to ensure that victims are not prevented from attending the trial and seeing justice done, due to their own financial limitations. Identification of vulnerable victims : victims should be treated in an individual manner and that a consistent mechanism is established to identify vulnerable victims who may require special measures during criminal proceedings. All victims of crime are per se vulnerable and accordingly require sensitive and careful treatment. However, some victims are particularly vulnerable to further victimisation or intimidation by the accused or suspected person or his associates. In addition, some victims are particularly at risk of being further distressed or harmed by their involvement in criminal proceedings whether through the giving of evidence or through other forms of participation. Such victims require special measures in order to minimise the likelihood of further harm occurring. The proposed Directive provides that the vulnerability of victims to such harm be determined by the personal characteristics of the victim and by the nature or type of crime a victim has suffered. The majority of children and persons with disabilities are at particular risk of harm due to their personal characteristics. As a group they can immediately be identified as vulnerable and in the majority of cases in need of special measures. Victims within other categories based on the nature or type of crime, such as victims of sexual violence, including exploitation, and victims of human trafficking are also in most cases vulnerable to further victimisation during proceedings. At the same time, the proposal recognises that victims are individuals who react in different ways to a crime and have different needs and vulnerabilities. Thus a victim may be vulnerable despite not falling into a specific vulnerable victim category. An individual assessment mechanism is therefore to be established to ensure that all vulnerable victims are identified and properly protected. Such an approach can be crucial in facilitating a victim’s recovery and ensuring they are provided with the right assistance and protection during proceedings and afterwards. It maximises the ability to prevent secondary and repeat victimisation and intimidation and to enable the victim to effectively access justice. Nevertheless, such an approach must be carried out to an extent proportionate to the likelihood that criminal proceedings will be instituted and that specific measures will be required by the victim. In particular the severity of the crime and the degree of apparent harm suffered by the victim provides a useful indication of the extent of any particular individual assessment. The individual assessment should determine a victim’s needs during proceedings and any requirements for referral to victim support services. Those public officials who first come into contact with a victim when a crime is reported should be trained and should have access to appropriate guidance, tools or protocols to enable them to carry out assessments of the needs of victims in a consistent manner. Individual assessments should consider any factors which may increase the likelihood of a victim suffering further victimisation or intimidation during proceedings. In particular, the following factors should be taken into account: age, gender and gender identity, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, state of health, disability, relationship to or dependence on the suspected or accused person. Victims of terrorism require particular attention in any assessment given the varying nature of such acts ranging from acts of mass terrorism to targeted terrorism against individuals. Right to avoidance of contact between victim and offender : this provision mirrors the approach taken in the 2001 Framework Decision with a view to ensuring that where a victim must attend a venue as a result of their participation in criminal proceedings, appropriate steps should be taken to ensure the victim does not have to come into contact with accused or suspected persons. This could be achieved by various means such as establishing separate waiting areas, and controlling the arrival of victims and the accused. Best practice and guidance offered to public officials can also act as an important source of information on how to assist in avoiding contact. Right to protection of victims during questioning in criminal investigations :the proposal aims toprevent secondary victimisation by ensuring that the victim is interviewed as early as possible and that interaction with authorities should be as easy as possible whilst limiting the number of unnecessary interactions the victim has with them. Decisions on when to carry out any interviews should as far as possible take account of the victim’s needs as well as any urgency in relation to the gathering of evidence. Victims may be accompanied by a trusted person of their choice. Only in exceptional circumstances should this possibility be limited and then only in relation to a specific person. The victim should then be permitted to be accompanied by another person of their choice. Right of protection of vulnerable victims including children during criminal proceedings : a series of measures aim to ensure that when victims have been identified as being vulnerable to further victimisation or intimidation, appropriate measures are taken to help prevent such harm. Such measures should be available throughout criminal proceedings whether during the initial investigative or prosecutorial phase or during the trial itself. The measures necessary will vary according to the stage of proceedings. During criminal investigation, minimum levels of protection are required in relation to any interviews with the victim. These should be carried out in a sensitive manner and officials should have received appropriate training to this end. To this end, it may be necessary, according to the vulnerability of the victim, that interviews are only carried out in appropriate premises. This may mean premises which allow for video interviews or simply where furniture for example is adapted for children or persons with disabilities. Vulnerable victims can find the interview process highly distressing, particularly where the crime is of a very personal nature. Establishing trust with the interviewer can be important and may only happen over a period of time. For this reason, this article requires that in most cases a vulnerable victim is to be interviewed by the same person. Exceptions are permitted for reasons of good administration, such as an urgent need to interview someone else or the unavailability of the usual interviewer. For similar reasons, in cases of sexual violence, victims should have the right to be interviewed by a person of the same gender. During the trial itself, protection from intimidation, whether intentional or not, is also a relevant factor when determining appropriate protection measures. This proposal establishes minimum measures for this purpose as well as to minimise the distress of, in particular, testifying. Measures to enable the victim to avoid visual contact with the defendant are established as well as measures to exclude members of the public and press. In particular, in order to ensure that the fundamental rights of an accused or suspected person are respected, the decision on whether such measures are to be taken is left to judicial discretion. However, the fact that a victim is a child, a person with a disability, a victim of sexual violence or of human trafficking combined with the individual assessment should provide a strong indication of the need for a protection measure. Given the particular vulnerabilities of children, additional measures should also be made available and utilised in normal circumstances. Interviews may be videotaped and used as evidence in court and that in appropriate cases, where a child does not have a representative, the judicial authority should appoint one. Training of practitioners : it is provided to establish training requirements for public officials who come into contact with victims. Training should cover issues which will assist officials to treat victims in a respectful manner, to identify protection needs and to provide them with appropriate information to help them cope with proceedings and access their rights. Such training should cover issues such as awareness of the negative effects of crime on victims and the risk of causing secondary victimisation, skills and knowledge, including special measures and techniques, required to assist victims and minimise any trauma to the victim in particular from secondary victimisation, recognising and preventing intimidation, threats and harm to victims, the availability of services providing information and support specific to the needs of victims and the means of accessing these services. Additionally, it is ensured that those providing victim support or restorative justice services should also be trained to an appropriate level such that they treat victims in a respectful and impartial manner and provide their services to professional standards. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: as provided in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (UNCLOS) and in the UN agreement relating to fish stocks of 4 August 1995, the management of certain straddling and highly migratory fish stocks requires the cooperation of all the countries whose fleets exploit that stock in order to ensure their long-term sustainability, either by direct consultation amongst each other or via the appropriate Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs). However, the adoption of unilateral measures by certain States lacking good will to work towards agreed measures may lead to considerable depletion of the fish stock in question even if other States engage in moderating their fishing effort. The EU being a lucrative market of destination for fisheries products, it has a particular responsibility in ensuring that the above-mentioned obligation of cooperation is respected. Therefore, it is necessary to provide the EU with the means to take effective measures against States not cooperating in good faith in the adoption of agreed management measures or responsible for measures and practices that lead to over-exploitation of stocks, in order to create a disincentive for the continuation of this unsustainable fishing. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment analysed the environmental, economic and social impacts of measures ranging from a ""zero option"" to a total ban on importations of the fish and fishery products in question, and including both measures that might extend beyond the trade context and non-legislative approaches. The conclusion of the impact assessment was that it would be pertinent to provide the EU with an instrument allowing the swift adoption of mostly trade-related measures. The measures would be introduced against countries which allow fishing that is conducted in a non-sustainable way that threatens the conservation of fish stocks. Indications of the possible form and content of the instrument were also suggested in the impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFUE). CONTENT: the proposal aims to lay down the framework for the adoption of certain measures regarding fisheries-related activities and policies by third countries with the aim of ensuring long-term sustainability of fish stocks of common interest between the European Union and those third countries. Accordingly, the proposal: · sets out a procedure so that equitable cost-effective measures can be taken in order to promote fisheries sustainability; · describe which countries are to be targeted by the measures (countries allowing non-sustainable fishing), the different types of measures that may be adopted and the conditions determining where and when they may be adopted; · stipulates that the measures are to be adopted as Commission implementing acts (in general the examination procedure would be applicable). Where a requirement for measures to be consistent with the EU international commitments is mentioned, it means that measures must be compatible with the obligations of the EU under the WTO Agreement, in particular as far as trade restrictions are concerned; · defines certain due process steps than shall be undertaken prior to the adoption of the measures vis-à-vis the countries allowing non-sustainable fishing. These demarches should allow the countries concerned to be heard and provide them an opportunity to rectify their actions; · determines the period of application of the measures, subject to the adoption of corrective measures by the countries concerned; defines the Committee that will assist the Commission in implementing the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no budgetary implications for the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a Common Market Organisation (CMO) for fisheries and aquaculture products has been in place since 1970. It is one of the pillars of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Its current legal basis is Regulation 104/2000, adopted in 1999. Since 2008, the Commission has been carrying out extensive evaluations and consultations to assess the performance of the current legal framework. Analyses led to identify five main problem areas found, which may be summarised as follows: (1) EU Common Market Organisation did not sufficiently contribute to sustainable production. (2) EU producers are facing limited or decreased production opportunities (fisheries and aquaculture). The production side is fragmented due to the number of species, landing and selling sites, whereas the demand side is strongly concentrated. EU production also lacks competitiveness in an increasingly globalised market. (3) EU producers to a large extent do not anticipate market demand in their production planning. This leads to a high volatility of first sale prices. (4) Potential is largely untapped. (5) The implementation of the Common Market Organisation is being held down by a cumbersome, overly complex framework. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy provides an excellent opportunity to review and possibly revise objectives and instruments of the Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: different policy alternatives options for the reform have been considered: continuing the current Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products; revising the current Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products by reducing intervention mechanisms to a single storage aid for fishery products destined for human consumption and making other instruments more simple, appropriate and flexible (marketing standards and information to consumers); enhancing the Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products by empowering Producers Organisations and Inter-Branch Organisations with new objectives and granting them financial support to draw and implement sustainable production and marketing plans; deregulating the current Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products. The Commission supports enhancing the Common Market Organisation so as to accompany the fisheries and aquaculture sector while it shifts toward sustainable production practices. The impact assessment concluded that, considering the new objectives and instruments of the CFP, a far-reaching reform of the Common Market Organisation was necessary: market-oriented instruments should contribute, directly or indirectly, to meeting the main CFP objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of the reform of the Common Fishery Policy is promoting the sustainable management of fishery resources through an economically viable sector, which in turn is to be increasingly empowered with its own management. In this context, the proposal for a reform of the Common Market Organisation focuses on the following objectives: Upgrading market incentives to support sustainable production practices : EU producers (fisheries and aquaculture) within Producers Organisations are on the coal face of production, day to day resource management and market issues. Their role, responsibility and mandate need to be reviewed in line with the objectives of the reform of the CFP in order to direct production activities towards sustainability. Other operators upstream in the sector should also be targeted so as to become more committed and responsible for sustainability of their sourcing. Improving the market position of EU production : addressing market imperfections, high information and transaction costs, as well as organisational matters, leads to focus on production activities (grouping supply and better marketing at first sale), increase competitiveness of EU production (quality, innovation and added value), reinforce bargaining power of producers and ensure level playing field conditions for all products marketed in the Union. Improving the connection between EU production and EU structural market changes and short term fluctuations should be better reflected in producers’ strategies : increasing transparency along the marketing chain of markets should facilitate supply meeting demand and enhance policy decision making. The volatility of first sale prices can be reduced by improving conditions for placing POs’ products on the market and by ensuring that production is planned and adjusted to demand in terms of quality, quantity and presentation. Enhancing the market potential of EU products : the comparative advantages of EU production (freshness, local, variety etc.) could be better exploited with more differentiation and merchandising. In addition EU consumers have the right to be informed with more precise and reliable information to reinforce confidence in fishery and aquaculture products. Supporting better governance, reduction of administrative burden and simplification of the legal framework : the existing provisions and instruments should be reviewed, simplified and clarified. The Common Market Organisation should be supported in the context of a new financial fund to be implemented within the reformed CFP. To address overfishing and unsustainable practices and move away from production strategies based solely on volume, the new Common Market Organisation will support: the empowerment of producers organisations and their co-management of access rights as well as production and marketing activities; market measures that increase the bargaining power of producers (in fisheries and aquaculture) improve prediction, prevention and management of market crisis and foster market transparency and efficiency; market incentives and premiums for sustainable practices; partnerships for sustainable production, sourcing and consumption; certification (ecolabels), promotion, information to consumers; additional market measures on discards. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 granted a number of countries duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market under certain conditions. After the negotiation process of the EPA with the ACP regions was concluded in December of 2007, a number of countries were offered such access in anticipation of the steps towards ratification of an EPA. However, several countries have neither taken the necessary steps towards ratification of an EPA nor concluded comprehensive regional negotiations. Accordingly, the proposal intends to remove those countries which have not signed their Agreements or have not ratified their agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the following States have not taken steps towards the completion of their respective agreements and will be removed from Annex I of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007: Botswana; Burundi; Cameroon; the Comoros; Côte d’Ivoire; the Fiji Islands; Ghana; Haiti; Kenya; Lesotho; Mozambique; Namibia; Rwanda; Swaziland; Tanzania; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe. According to the criteria set out in Article 2(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, trade preferences granted to these countries should no longer be maintained. The Commission will continue to work with a view to ensuring that these countries become a contracting party to an EPA, and will use to the full the recent momentum of different negotiations to create a sustainable long term trade regime with these partners in keeping with the EPA negotiating directives and the priorities set out in the Cotonou Agreement. The Commission has informed the Council, the European Parliament, the ACP Group of States and civil society that the current situation is not sustainable, as duty-free quota-free market access is still granted to beneficiary countries which are not taking the necessary steps towards ratification of the agreements on which this access is based, thus removing the justification for its advance provisional application. Delegated acts: should the countries removed from Annex I take the necessary steps towards ratification of an EPA, they would continue to benefit from the respective trade preferences and could therefore be re-instated in the Annex as soon as possible in order to provide continuity of their market access. To this end the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU for the purpose of amending Annex I in order to reinstate these countries. The proposal states that the delegation of power shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time and may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council. A delegated act shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of 2 months and that period shall be extended by 2 months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue – the effect is as follows: the amount budgeted for the year 2011: EUR 16 653 700 000. Own resources (customs duties) will increase by EUR 381.60 million for each year from 2014 to 2016 inclusive. The reason is that if a country is removed from a list of beneficiaries, it will export to the EU under a different trade regime which is either less favourable or at best equal to the regime offered by the Regulation, resulting in more customs duties being collected on behalf of the EU. The calculation of impact on the EU budget takes the situation created by Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 as the status quo (duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market, no duties paid). Then, for each country concerned, it compares the status quo to duties paid under an alternative trade regime each country will enjoy once removed from the list of beneficiaries, which is as follows: for least-developed countries (LDCs): the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme, offering duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market (no duties paid); for upper-middle-income countries (UMICs): the most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment (duties paid as per general EU tariff schedule); for other developing countries (DCs): the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that suspends or reduces tariffs (some duties paid, some at a reduced rate). The final impact on the EU budget will depend on the number of countries removed from the list of beneficiaries. The amendment proposes to remove 18 countries from Annex I, of which 9 would not benefit from the EBA scheme and therefore their exports to the EU would be subject to a duty. However, if they fulfill certain conditions before the amendment takes effect on 1 January 2014, they will continue to benefit from current trade preferences. In this respect, the figure given is a maximum, as it assumes all 9 concerned countries will be removed: in fact, if a country continues to benefit from the Regulation, the customs duties will not accrue to the EU budget and the figure will be lower."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its conclusions of 4 February 2011, the Council therefore invited Member States to inform from 1 January 2012 the Commission of all their new and existing bilateral energy agreements with third countries. The aim is to facilitate coordination at Union level and Member States' activities with a view to ensuring consistency and coherence in the EU’s external energy relations with key producer, transit, and consumer countries. Negotiations with powerful energy suppliers in third countries typically demand political support in the form of the conclusion of intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries. Following the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets in the European Union, in particular with the implementation of the Third Energy Package, the Member States have introduced significant changes in their energy legislation. Facing a possible supply shortage, Member States are under increasing pressure to accept regulatory concessions in their intergovernmental agreements with third countries which are incompatible with Union energy law. Such regulatory concessions threaten the operation and proper functioning of the Union internal market for energy. As was demonstrated during the gas dispute between the Russian Federation and Ukraine in January 2009, when the internal market is not functioning properly, the EU is more vulnerable to security of supply risks. Therefore it is important that the Member States and the Commission are aware of the amount and sources of energy imported. To address these problems, it is important to improve the exchange of information between Member States and between Member States and the Commission on existing, provisionally applied and future intergovernmental agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not considered it necessary to carry out a formal impact assessment. The Commission nevertheless evaluated a number of options to achieve the proper transposition of the European Council conclusions. A public consultation on the external dimension of the EU energy policy took place between 21 December 2010 and 7 March 2011. In total, over 90 replies were received. The responses received highlighted the important role of the Union in promoting a reliable legal and institutional framework in order to achieve mutually advantageous relations with its main energy suppliers and transit countries. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to transform the 4 February 2011 European Council conclusions into a mechanism with detailed procedures for the exchange of information between Member States and the Commission with regard to intergovernmental agreements in order to facilitate coordination at Union level to ensure security of supply, the proper operation and functioning of the Union internal energy market and create legal certainty for investment decisions. As the proposed exchange of information will increase the Member States' negotiating position vis-à-vis third countries, it will ensure the proper implementation of the Union rules and policies. Thus: it will allow taking the perspective of the collective security of supply situation in the EU, instead of a national perspective; the use of commonly developed standard clauses and the proposed compatibility check will furthermore provide investors with increased legal certainty as regards the likely compatibility of the intergovernmental agreement with EU legislation. Scope : Intergovernmental agreements are defined as all legally binding agreements between Member States and third countries which are likely to have an impact on the operation or the functioning of the internal market for energy or on the security of energy supply in the EU. To avoid duplication, intergovernmental agreements for which a specific notification to the Commission is already foreseen in other acts of Union legislation are excluded from the proposal, except intergovernmental agreements which must be submitted to the Commission according to the Security of Gas Supply Regulation.10 It is also proposed that the new mechanism shall not concern agreements between commercial operators except and only as far as the intergovernmental agreement explicitly refers to these commercial agreements. Exchange of information between Commission and Member States : Member States shall submit all existing and provisionally applied intergovernmental agreements between them and third countries in their entirety, including their annexes and other texts they refer to explicitly and all amendments thereto to the Commission at the latest three months after the entry into force of this Decision. When a Member State intends to enter into negotiations with a third country in order to amend an existing intergovernmental agreement or to conclude a new intergovernmental agreement, the Member State shall inform the Commission in writing of its intention at the earliest possible moment before the envisaged opening of the negotiations. Once the intergovernmental agreement is ratified, the ratified text shall be sent to the Commission . Intergovernmental agreements shall be submitted in their entirety, including their annexes, other texts they refer to and all amendments thereto. The Commission will make all information received available to the Member States via a database. When providing information to the Commission, a Member State may indicate whether any part of the information in the agreements submitted is to be regarded as confidential. Assistance from the Commission : the Commission shall also be informed as early as possible of their intention to open negotiations on future intergovernmental agreements or to amend existing intergovernmental agreements. The Commission shall be regularly informed on the negotiations. On request, the Commission shall participate as an observer to the negotiations. In this context, Member States also have the right to ask the Commission for assistance during their negotiations with third countries. Ex-ante compatibility control : the Commission may on its own initiative until four weeks after it has been informed of the closure of the negotiations at the latest or on request from the Member State which has negotiated the intergovernmental agreement, assess the compatibility of the negotiated agreement with Union law before the agreement has been signed. The Commission has an assessment period of four months. If such compatibility check has been requested, in the absence of an opinion of the Commission within this examination period, the Commission is deemed not to have raised any objections. Coordination : the Commission shall facilitate the coordination among Member States with a view to reviewing developments in relation to intergovernmental agreements, identifying common problems and solutions, and developing standard clauses that Member States can use in future intergovernmental agreements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: farmers and producers of agricultural products face competitive pressure resulting from policy reform, globalisation, the concentration of bargaining power in the retail sector, and the state of the economy. At the same time, consumers increasingly look for authentic products produced using specific and traditional methods. The diversity and quality of European Union agricultural production should be an important strength and source of competitive advantage for Union farmers. However, in order for consumers and buyers to be properly informed about the characteristics and farming attributes of agricultural product, they need to receive accurate and trustworthy labelling information. Most tools already exist at European Union level. Since the 1990s, Union agricultural product quality policy has been closely identified with three Union schemes, namely for protected designations of origin (PDOs) and protected geographical indications (PGIs), for organic farming, and for traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG). In addition, Union marketing standards have provided a legislative framework for fair competition and smooth functioning of the market since the inception of the common agricultural policy. Analysis and discussion with stakeholders has shown that these tools may be improved, simplified and made more coherent. In 2007 a major conference was held bringing together all types of quality schemes: ‘Food quality certification—adding value to farm produce’. The Conference led to the 2008 Green Paper on agricultural product quality, which elicited over 560 detailed stakeholder responses and provided the input for the Communication on agricultural product quality policy in 2009. In response to this communication, the European Parliament adopted the resolution , ‘Agricultural product quality policy: what strategy to follow?’ in March 2010. The Quality Package consists of a set of proposals designed to put in place a coherent agricultural product quality policy . It is aimed at assisting farmers to better communicate the qualities, characteristics and attributes of agricultural product, and at ensuring appropriate consumer information. The Quality Package includes: · a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on agricultural product quality schemes; · a proposal to modify Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (the single Common Market Organisation) concerning marketing standards for agricultural products; · guidelines setting out best practice for the development and operation of certification schemes relating to agricultural products and foodstuffs; · guidelines on the labelling of foodstuffs using Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) as ingredients. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: concerning geographical indications, the analysis showed strong justification for a Union-level geographical indications scheme and discarded alternatives to a European Union scheme for reasons of low efficiency and effectiveness (including co-regulation and self-regulation by the sector, no action at European Union level, protection through the international Lisbon Agreement , replacement by a notification system for national geographical indications, and protection through the existing Community collective trade mark). The impact assessment identified considerable ground for reducing complexity and facilitating enforcement by merging the agricultural product and foodstuffs scheme with those in the alcoholic beverages sectors, while assuring the specificities of each system. The impact assessment found that merging the instruments for protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI) would diminish the added-value benefits of the PDO identification. Concerning traditional specialities guaranteed, three options were analysed: (i) introducing the term 'traditional' as optional quality term and abolishing the current scheme; (ii) no EU action; (iii) and simplifying the current scheme (allowing only registration with reservation of the name). The impact assessment showed that eliminating the TSG scheme would lead for protected names to loss of the economic and social benefits of EU-wide protection and was found to be unacceptable to stakeholders and to the EU legislator. In social terms, the designations of PDO, PGI and TSG were found to contribute to the continuation of traditional forms of production to the benefit of both producers and consumers. However, both the impact assessments for geographical indications and for traditional specialities guaranteed highlighted the widespread failure of these schemes to attract participation of very small-scale producers, notwithstanding that small-scale producers are often associated with artisanal product, traditional methods and local marketing, the European Union schemes are seen as burdensome in terms of application, necessitate costly controls, and require adherence to a specification. Therefore, further study and analysis will be carried out in order to assess the problems faced by small-scale producers in participating in Union quality schemes. On the basis of the results of this analysis, the Commission may propose appropriate follow-up. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2), and for Title II also Article 118(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Quality Package aims to improve the Union legislation in the field of quality, as well as in the operation of national and private certification schemes, in order to make them simpler, more transparent and easier to understand, adaptable to innovation, and less burdensome for producers and administrations The single Regulation for agricultural product quality schemes presents three complementary schemes (designations of origin and geographical indications; traditional specialities guaranteed; optional quality terms) in a single regulatory structure, overseen by a single quality policy committee. A separate Regulation covers the Marketing Standards. 1. Designations of origin and geographical indications, excluding wines, aromatised wines and spirits : the proposal maintains and reinforces the scheme for agricultural products and foodstuffs, but does not bring together the geographical indications schemes for wines, for spirits, or for aromatized wines. In the light of relatively recent reforms of the wine and spirits legislation, at this stage, the schemes should remain distinct. This issue can be reconsidered at a later date. In the meantime, the rules for the scheme for agricultural products and foodstuffs will be converged, where appropriate, to those for wines. The main elements designed to strengthen and simplify the scheme are the following: · recognition of the roles and responsibilities of groups applying for registration of names with regard to monitoring, promotion and communication; · the reinforcement and clarification of the level of protection of registered names and the common Union symbols; · the procedure to register names is shortened; · the respective roles of Member States and groups applying for registration have been clarified with regard to the enforcement of protection of the registered names throughout the European Union, and · the definitions of designations of origin and geographical indications are more closely aligned to international usage. The proposal streamlines the current process of registration of designations of origin and geographical indications by shortening time delays. In addition, certain legal issues are clarified and terminology aligned with the recently adopted legislation on geographical indications for wine. Minimum common rules on official controls to ensure product follows the specification and to ensure correct labelling in the marketplace are also laid down. The scope of the Regulation is maintained (agricultural products for human consumption and certain other products), while dark chocolate is added. 2. Traditional specialities guaranteed : the proposal maintains the scheme for reservation of names of traditional specialities guaranteed across the European Union, but discontinues the option of registering names without reservation. The function of giving publicity, but not protection, to traditional products is best accomplished at national (or regional) level, and European Union action cannot be justified. The renewed European Union scheme for traditional specialities guaranteed is simplified (registration process streamlined by shortening delays, procedures aligned on PDO-PGI ones) and targeted in several respects: (i) the criterion of tradition is extended to 50 years (from 25 years) to reinforce the credibility of the scheme; (ii) the scheme is restricted to prepared meals and processed product; (iii) and definitions and procedural requirements are substantially simplified to improve understanding of the scheme. 3. Optional quality terms : concerning the optional quality terms, which have in common with the quality schemes that they are optional and assist farmers to identify value-adding characteristics and attributes of product in the marketplace, it is proposed to bring these into the present regulation. The optional quality terms are not amended in content, but adapted to the legislative framework of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Further study and analysis will be carried out in order to assess the problems faced by producers of mountain products in labelling their products on the market. On the basis of the results of this analysis, the Commission may propose appropriate follow-up. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: none of the European Union schemes have budgetary implications. However, it has been shown necessary for the Commission to take a more active role to protect the names of the quality schemes and the Union symbols, particularly in third countries. To achieve this, additional budgetary resources are necessary. The initial estimate of appropriations necessary for measures in particular for the registration and defence of logos, indications and abbreviations in 3rd countries amounts to EUR 110 000 in 2012 and EUR 150 000 annually as from 2013. The funding foreseen in 2014 and 2015 is subject to the availability of appropriations in these years."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: l ibraries, museums, archives, educational establishments, film heritage institutions and public service broadcasting organisations are engaged in large-scale digitisation of their collections or archives in order to create European Digital Libraries. In so doing, they contribute to the preservation and dissemination of European cultural heritage, which is also important for the creation of European Digital Libraries, such as Europeana. Prior authorisations are necessary to make works protected by copyright available to the public in an online digital library or archive. When the relevant copyright owner cannot be identified or found the works in question are known as orphan works. Libraries or other institutions that make works available online to the public without prior authorisation risk infringing copyright. This initiative builds on the Commission's 2006 Recommendation on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural content and digital preservation. Despite the Recommendation, only a handful of Member States have implemented orphan works legislation. The few existing national solutions are circumscribed by the fact that they limit online access to citizens resident in their national territories. The creation of a legal framework to facilitate the cross-border digitisation and dissemination of orphan works in the single market is also one of the key actions identified in the Digital Agenda for Europe  which is part of the Europe 2020 Strategy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t he impact assessment analyses six options: Option 1 : do nothing, Option 2 : a statutory exception to copyright, Option 3 : extended collective licensing, Option 4 : an orphan-specific licence granted by collecting societies, Option 5 : an orphan-specific licence granted by a public body, and Option 6 : the mutual recognition of national solutions regarding orphan works. All policy options (except Option 1) are premised on the adoption of a directive that will require all Member States to enact specific orphan works legislation within a specified timeframe. All policy options, except Option 3, are premised on the requirement that a diligent search is necessary prior to the making available of an orphan work in an online digital library. The Commission considers that an approach based on mutual recognition of the orphan status (Option 6) allows libraries and other beneficiaries to enjoy legal certainty as to the ""orphan status"" of a particular work. Mutual recognition ensures that the orphan works contained in a digital library would be available to citizens across Europe. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to create a legal framework to ensure the lawful, crossborder online access to orphan works contained in online digital libraries or archives operated by a variety of institutions that are specified in the proposal when such orphan works are used in the pursuance of the public interest mission of such institutions. Such works include: works published in the form of books, journals, newspapers, magazines or other writings, and which are contained in the collections of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, or cinematographic or audiovisual works contained in the collections of film heritage institutions, or cinematographic, audio or audiovisual works produced by public service broadcasting organisations before the 31 December 2002 and contained in their archives. The proposal deals with the diligent search necessary to identify whether a particular work is an orphan work and, once this has been established, to make it legal to make this work available to the public online under certain conditions and for specific purposes. The proposal also clarifies the application of extended collective licences to works which are potentially orphan works. More specifically, the proposal: contains the definition of an orphan work. The definition of an orphan work incorporates the requirement of a diligent search; explains how the diligent search is to be carried out by those who are permitted to use orphan works. It also clarifies that a diligent search need only be carried out in the Member State of first publication of the work; establishes the principle of mutual recognition whereby a work deemed to be an orphan work after a diligent search shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States; concerns the possibility to put an end to the orphan work status; enumerates the uses that the named beneficiaries are permitted to undertake with respect to orphan works (to make them available to the public, within the meaning of Directive 2001/29/EC, and to reproduce such works, within the meaning of Directive 2001/29/EC, for the purposes of achieving their public interest mission); specifies how Member States may permit certain additional uses under specific conditions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: against the background of the unprecedented and devastating floods in Pakistan in July and August 2010, the European Council at its meeting on 16 September mandated Ministers to agree urgently a comprehensive package of short, medium and longer term measures which will help underpin Pakistan's recovery and future development. These should, inter alia, include ambitious trade measures granting, exclusively to Pakistan, increased market access to the EU through the immediate and time limited reduction of duties on key imports from Pakistan. The European Council invited the Commission to present in October a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to unilaterally suspend duties on certain imports from Pakistan for a limited period of time. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal extends autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan by suspending for a limited period of time all tariffs for certain products of export interest to Pakistan. The provision of these trade preferences would not cause any meaningful adverse effects on the domestic market of the Union and would not affect negatively least developed Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 60% of Pakistan's exports to the EU are textiles and clothing. Consequently, a large number of products proposed for liberalisation are textiles and clothing. Yet, since the product scope should be as broad as possible, it also includes other industrial and agricultural products in order not to undermine Pakistan's efforts to diversify its industries and exports base. A list of 75 dutiable products lines of importance for Pakistan's exports has been established. The selected product lines amount to almost €900 million in import value, accounting for about 27% of EU imports from Pakistan (€3.3 billion). Liberalising these 75 lines, of which one product line (ethanol) would be subject to an annual tariff rate quota of 100 000 tonnes based on past imports, would result in an estimated increase in EU imports from Pakistan of around €100 million per year compared to 2009, while lowering tariff revenue for the EU budget by slightly more than €80 million. The autonomous trade preferences will be either in the form of an exemption from customs duties upon import in the Union or in the form of tariff-rate quotas. Entitlement to benefit from the autonomous trade preferences is conditional on Pakistan's compliance with the relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto as well as involvement in effective administrative cooperation with the Union in order to prevent any risk of fraud. Given the urgency of the situation in Pakistan, the Regulation should apply as of 1 January 2011, provided that the WTO has approved the request from the Union for the waiver from its obligations under GATT Articles I and XIII. In order to ensure an immediate and sustainable impact on the economic recovery of Pakistan in the aftermath of the floods it is recommended to limit the duration of the trade preferences until 31 December 2013. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: the proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue. In total the gross loss in customs duties amounts to €82.4 million, while the net loss would be 25% lower (Member States' collection costs) at €61.8 million. These figures build on the assumption that Pakistan currently fully makes use of its preferential access to the EU market."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the present proposal takes into account recent legislative and political developments regarding the Financial Regulation (FR). For the sake of legal clarity and in order to facilitate the negotiations of the European Parliament and the Council, it merges and replaces two earlier Commission proposals on the revision of the FR in a single text and under a standard legislative format (no recast). These two earlier proposals concerned on the one hand, the triennial revision of the Financial Regulation and, on the other hand, the revision of the FR to align it with the Lisbon Treaty , including the obligations of Member States concerning internal control and audit and their resulting responsibilities in shared management. Therefore, these two earlier proposals are withdrawn. Additionally, the proposal also incorporates the changes to the FR due to the adoption of the Regulation No 1081/2010 regarding the creation of the European External Action Service ('EEAS'). LEGAL BASE AND PROCEDURE: since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the FR is to be revised in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure in Article 322 TFEU. In order to allow the legislative authority to have a global view of the proposed modifications, the Implementing Rules of the Financial Regulation (IR) are presented, in a Commission Staff working document, together with the FR in a single package. The IR, which contains more detailed provisions complementing the FR, will be adopted under the delegated powers of the Commission according to Article 290 TFEU. The present proposal does not contain any change of substance compared to the two earlier proposals , which are: (i) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Union; (ii) proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. As a consequence, the working document of the Commission services concerning the Implementing Rules to the FR, which has been put forward by the Commission together with the triennial revision, remains entirely valid. CONTENT: in 2011 more than EUR 126 billion is planned for allocation to EU policies benefiting the Union and its citizens. In the current economic context it is even more important that the delivery mechanisms of the budget operate in the most efficient way and facilitate the implementation of EU policies, while securing sound treatment of European taxpayers' money. In particular, it is important that these mechanisms are: (i) simple and transparent (especially to final recipients of EU funds); (ii) provide the possibility for leverage of non-EU budget resources and at the same time (iii) strengthen the Commission's accountability for implementation of the budget. (1) Need for a reform : reform is necessary with a view to adapting the financial rules to the new requirements of budget implementation (co-financing with other donors, specific financial instruments, PPPs) or where the basic principles create disproportionate workload (interests on pre-financing) or may unduly impede efficiency (prohibition of budget implementation through private sector bodies). The award of small grants and contracts also needs to be facilitated. Furthermore, the new procedure applicable to the IR, as set out in the Lisbon Treaty, should lead to a new articulation between the FR and the IR, imposing a complete review of the whole set of financial rules. In this context, the Commission has based its proposal on the following objectives: · to introduce more flexibility in the application of budgetary principles, which should better suit operational needs and alleviate unnecessary administrative burden for recipients of Union funds; · to streamline relations with implementing partners to which the Commission entrusts the management of programmes or part of programming actions (projects), in particular taking account of the nature of the implementing partner (Member States, agencies, EIB, public and private operators, etc.) and the financial risks entailed (proportionality); · to shift the regime of grants from a real-cost based management (inputs) towards a performance-based scheme (outputs), in order to better target policy objectives and achieve significant simplification of procedural and documentary requirements for the benefit of beneficiaries, and facilitate the use of lump sums; · to ensure sound financial management while leaving significant room for manoeuvre for Authorising Officers so that they can adapt the means to their operational constraints and the financial risks they are faced with; · to modernise the system of risk management and control measures so as to make them more proportional to the probability of errors and to the cost involved. (2) Alignment with the Lisbon Treaty : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – (TFEU), which entered into force on December 1, 2009, makes important changes concerning budgetary and financial issues. These changes should be translated in the Financial Regulation and concern in particular: · the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the Treaty, and its link to annual budgetary procedure: in this regard, as a consequence of the introduction of the multiannual financial framework in the TFEU, some provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management should be introduced in the Financial Regulation; · the new annual budgetary procedure and the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, which have an impact on the provisions relating to transfers and the provisional twelfths; · the new provisions introduced in Article 317 TFEU concerning the control and audit obligations of the Member States in the implementation of the budget, together with Point 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. The proposal also allows for the streamlining of the Financial Regulation in line with the Lisbon Treaty, through both technical adaptations and the deletion of obsolete provisions. TIMETABLE: the present revision of the FR occurs while preparation for the post-2013 programmes is also under way. It is important that all the actors concerned in the legislative process maintain an ambitious timetable for the present revision. They should aim at an agreement on the package (Financial Regulation and Implementing Rules) so that it could enter into application on 1 January 2012."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2008/971/EC2 provided the list of countries to be recognised for the application of the equivalence principle for importation and determined conditions under which forest reproductive material of the 'source identified' and 'selected' categories produced in those countries is imported in the Union. The national rules for the certification of forest reproductive material in Canada, Croatia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States of America provide for an official field inspection to be carried out during the collection and processing of seed and the production of planting stock. According to those rules, the systems for the approval and registration of basic material and the subsequent production of reproductive material from this basic material should follow the OECD Scheme for the certification of forest reproductive material moving in international trade (OECD Forest seed and plant scheme). In addition, those rules require seed and planting stock of the ‘source identified’ and ‘selected’ categories and of the category 'qualified' to be officially certified and the seed packages to be officially closed in accordance with the OECD Forest seed and plant scheme. An examination of those rules as regards the category 'qualified' has shown that the conditions for approval of basic material satisfy the requirements laid down in Council Directive 1999/105/EC on the marketing of forest reproductive material. Accordingly, the Commission considers it appropriate to add the category “qualified” to the 'source identified' and 'selected' categories. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. Member States and stakeholders proposed that the Commission should submit this updating to facilitate trades, in particular the importation of forest reproductive material and to promptly respond to the marketing request in particular for fast growing tree plantations intended for energy/biomass production. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Decision states that the rules for certification of forestry material of the category 'qualified' in Canada, Croatia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States of America should be considered as equivalent to those set out in Directive 1999/105/EC, provided that the conditions set out in Annex II of Decision 2008/971/EC are satisfied as regards seed and planting stocks, are satisfied. As regards material of the 'qualified' category, those conditions should include, the provision of information on whether the products have been or not genetically modified. Such information should facilitate the application of the requirements set out in Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2009, an estimated 11.9 million Union citizens were living in another Member State than their own and many more might exercise this right at some point in their lives: a Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2009 showed that more than one third (35%) of European citizens would consider working in another Member State. However, close to one in five Europeans see too many obstacles to working in another Member State. Lack of information is (together with language difficulties) is the most important barrier to cross-border commuting, which constitutes, besides trans-national migration, the main form of geographic labour mobility within the EU. Recent surveys have also shown that the information citizens need in order to exercise their right to free movement is not strictly limited to the conditions for using this right as such: amongst the administrative issues which people had looked at prior to moving to another Member State, the two items mentioned most often were social security and welfare and the recognition of academic diplomas. It is clear that citizens who wish to study, work, retire, live in another Member State need to be adequately informed about the different rights available to them in cross-border situations and to be able to effectively enjoy them in practice. Without this knowledge citizens are not able to make informed decisions about making use of their free movement rights. More broadly, citizens' awareness of their rights to free movement and more generally of their rights as Union citizens is crucial to enable individuals, businesses and society as a whole to benefit from the full range of opportunities available in the single market. The significant gaps in citizens' awareness of their rights were demonstrated by a 2010 Eurobarometer survey which showed that, although Europeans are broadly aware of their status as Union citizens (79% claim some familiarity with the term 'citizen of the European Union'), they lack concrete knowledge about the exact meaning of rights attached to this status. More specifically, only 43% know the meaning of the term 'citizen of the European Union' and almost half of European citizens (48%) indicate that they are not well informed about their rights. In the EU Citizenship Report 2010""Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens' rights"", the Commission identified main obstacles which citizens still encounter in their daily lives when they seek to exercise their rights as Union citizens and outlined 25 concrete actions to remove these obstacles. In the context of this exercise, the Commission concluded that Union citizens are prevented from enjoying their rights because they lack awareness of them and announced its intention to step up the dissemination of information to Union citizens about their rights as such and in particular about their free movement rights. The designation of 2013 as the European Year of Citizens, leading to the organisation of targeted events on EU citizenship and citizen-related EU policies during this year, is thus listed in the EU Citizenship Report 2010 as one of the actions to implement in order to remedy this lack of awareness. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an ex-ante evaluation was carried out, which indicated amongst other matters, that the actions to be implemented in the proposed European Year do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. The proposal respects therefore the principle of proportionality. LEGAL BASIS: Article 21(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). Although Member States retain the primary responsibility for raising citizens' awareness of their rights as Union citizens, adequate actions to address this problem require multilateral partnerships, transnational exchanges of information and experience and Union-wide awareness-raising and dissemination of good practices. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed European Year can be better achieved at Union level. CONTENT: the year 2013 shall be designated as the European Year of Citizens. The overall purpose of the proposed European Year of Citizens is to ensure that all Union citizens are aware of the rights available to them in a cross-border context by virtue of their Union citizenship status, so as to enable them to make informed decisions about whether to make use of their right to free movement and to facilitate the effective exercise of this right. The European Year will aim, more specifically, at: raising Union citizens' awareness of their right to move and reside freely within the European Union and more generally the rights guaranteed to Union citizens in cross-border situations, including their right to participate in the democratic life of the Union; raising Union citizens' awareness of how they can tangibly benefit from EU rights and policies while living in another Member State, and at stimulating their active participation in civic fora on Union policies and issues; stimulating a debate about the impact and potential of the right to free movement, as an inalienable aspect of Union citizenship, in particular in terms of strengthening societal cohesion and mutual understanding between Union citizens and the bond between citizens and the Union. Initiatives involved : the measures to be taken to achieve these objectives may include the following initiatives organised at Union, national, regional or local level linked to the objectives of the European Year: information, education and awareness raising campaigns targeted at the general public and more specific audiences; exchange of information, sharing of experience and good practices of national, regional, local administrations and other organisations; conferences and events to promote debate and raise awareness of the importance and benefits of the right to free movement and residence and more generally citizens' rights as Union citizens; use of the existing multilingual participatory tools to stimulate citizens' contributions in giving tangible effect to their rights and more generally in achieving the objectives of the European Year; strengthening of the role and visibility of the multilingual Europe Direct and Your Europe web portal as key elements of a 'one-stop-shop' information system on Union citizens' rights; strengthening of the role and visibility of problem solving tools, such as SOLVIT, to allow Union citizens to better make use of and defend their rights. Coordination at Union level : the Commission shall cooperate closely with Member States and bodies and associations which represent local and regional interests, in particular the Committee of Regions. It will also cooperate closely with the European Economic and Social Committee. It will convene meetings of representatives of European organisations or bodies active in the field of defending citizens' rights and stakeholders to assist the Commission in implementing the European Year at Union level. Evaluation :by 31 December 2014, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in the Decision. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: no additional funding is sought for the European Year. The flexibility for annual priority setting based on the budget lines and programmes of the Directorate General for Communication provides sufficient financial margin for running the Year on a EUR 1 million scale."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 requires dual-use items to be subject to effective control when they are exported from or transit through the EU, or are delivered to a third country as a result of brokering services provided by a broker resident or established in the EU. Annex I to the Regulation : this establishes the common list of dual-use items that are subject to controls in the EU. Decisions on the items subject to controls are taken within the framework of the Australia Group (AG), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The Regulation provides for Annex I to be updated in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any modification thereof, that Member States have accepted as members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties. The international export control regimes take control list decisions approximately 4 times per year. These updates need to be integrated into EU legislation on a regular and timely basis due to their security and trade implications. Currently, any update of Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 including of Annex I requires the use of the ordinary legislative procedure. At the same time, given the technical nature of these amendments and the fact that these changes need to be in conformity with decisions taken in the international export control regimes, there is little margin for manoeuvre for introducing modifications to the amendments agreed in the regimes. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce delegated acts in order to update Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 on a regular basis. This approach would allow the Commission to make the necessary updates as and when required. Annex II : Annex II sets out the EU General Export Authorisations currently in force in the EU. The Commission proposed in December 2008 to introduce six new EU General Export Authorisations. An agreement concerning these new Authorisations was reached in mid-2011. The contents of existing and future EU General Export Authorisations need to be continuously monitored in order to ensure that only low-risk transactions are covered by the Authorisations. Given the fast pace of developments around the world, there is a need to ensure that existing EU General Export Authorisations can be modified rapidly as regards their destination and item scopes, so that changing global circumstances can be properly reflected in the EU export control system. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce delegated acts in order to allow the Commission to rapidly remove destinations and/or items from the scope of existing EU General Export Authorisations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 TFEU. CONTENT : the proposal introduces the following provisions : ·  it empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts concerning the removal of destinations and items from the scope of EU General Export Authorisations included in Annex II. It also makes provision for an urgent procedure where, in the case of a significant change of circumstances as regards the assessment of the sensitivity of exports under an EU General Export Authorisation included in Annex II, imperative grounds of urgency require a removal of particular destinations and/or items from the scope of an EU General Export Authorisation; ·  it empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts concerning updating the list of dual-use items set out in Annex, within the scope set out in the text. The delegation of power shall be conferred for an indeterminate period of time and may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A delegated act adopted shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of 2 months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by 2 months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not entail any additional cost for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: r ules on training and certification of seafarers have been agreed at an international level by means of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention), adopted in 1978 by conference at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), entered into force in 1984 and significantly amended in 1995. The STCW Convention has been integrated into Union law for the first time by Council Directive 94/58/EC of 22 November 1994 on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Afterwards the EU rules on training and certification of seafarers have been adapted to the subsequent amendments to the Convention, while a common EU mechanism for the recognition of the systems of training and certification of seafarers in the third countries has been set up; lately, the rules of the Union on this matter have through a recast become Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. In 2010 a Conference between the State Parties to the STCW Convention was held in Manila and introduced several significant changes to the Convention, namely on the prevention of fraudulent practices for certificates, in the field of medical standards, in the matter of training on security and with respect to training in technology-related matters. The Manila amendments have also introduced requirements for able seafarers and established new professional profiles, such as electro-technical officers. The Manila amendments to the Convention will enter into force on 1 January 2012. From that date onwards maritime training will have to meet the new requirements. Since the EU Member States are also parties to the Convention, and none of them opposed the Manila amendments, they will have to adapt their legislation to the new text of the Convention. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. As for the proposed directive, the experts of the Member States were consulted on the review exercise in a meeting which was held in Brussels on 3 December 2010. On that occasion the Member States unanimously expressed their wish that the Manila amendments should be integrated into EU law, while they considered that no overhaul of the directive should be carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal is to integrate into EU law the 2010 amendments to the STCW Convention, in order in particular to avoid any conflict between the international and the EU obligations of the Member States. New rules introduced following the Manila amendments : the 2010 amendments regard both the ""Regulations"" annexed to the Convention and the more technical ""Code"", whose Part ""A"", as explained, is mandatory. The main amendments to the Convention, which are reflected in the present proposal, are: strengthened provisions concerning training and assessment, the issuance of certificates of competency, as well as for prevention of fraudulent practices; updated standards relating to medical fitness, fitness for duty as well as alcohol abuse; new requirements concerning certification for able seafarers, for electro-technical officers as well as security-related training for all seafarers; updated requirements for personnel on certain types of ships; clarification and simplification of the definition of ""certificate"". In addition, the proposal has adapted the STCW provisions on watchkeeping, in order to bring them in line with the EU rules on working time for seafarers. Deadline for the recognition of third countries : t he proposal also aims to make more realistic the current three-month deadline for the recognition of third countries currently provided for in Article 19(3) of Directive 2008/106. This deadline shall be extended to 18 months. This provision is about the timeframe available to the Commission to decide on the recognition of a third country following a request by a Member State. Providing the Commission with existing information on certificates : a potential source of accurate data is the certificates and endorsements issued by the national administrations. Currently, under the STCW Convention State Parties are obliged to maintain registers of all certificates and endorsements and the relevant revalidations or other measures affecting them. While this is an important source of data, the different formats used by each Member State do not allow for a complete picture. Therefore, the present proposal foresees a new provision requiring the Member States to provide standardised information to the Commission for the purpose of statistical analysis. The detailed content of such information is presented in a technical annex to the present proposal. Adaptation to the new rules on ""comitology"" : the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced significant changes to the ""comitology"" mechanism. Under the new Treaty the procedure for technical adaptation of the directive is governed by the rules on ""delegated acts"", while the decisions on recognition of third countries by those on ""implementing acts"". The present proposal contains provisions to that effect. Entry into Force and Transitional Arrangements : the amendments to the STCW Convention agreed at Manila will enter into force on 1 January 2012. Since at that point in time the present proposal will not have been adopted yet, it has been foreseen that the proposed directive should enter into force as soon as it is published in the Official Journal. The Manila agreement also includes transitional arrangements. These arrangements allow for the renewal and revalidation of certificates issued before the entry into force of the amended Convention on 1 January 2012. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: this Agreement is presented as a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, signed on 20 November 1995 rather than as a stand alone Agreement. The Protocol will allow Community exporters, if they so choose, to test and certify their industrial products to the same (aligned) requirements prior to export, and then access that market without any further conformity assessment requirements. The certification procedures will only need to be carried out one time for both markets and against the same aligned requirements or standards. The recognition of certification will permit savings and stimulate exports. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 in conjunction the first sentence of the first subparagraph of Article 300(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopts this proposal for a decision to conclude the ACAA with Israel. General principles of the Agreement : the ACAA facilitates market access by eliminating technical barriers to trade with respect to industrial products. To this end, the ACAA provides for two mechanisms: under the first mechanism, mutual recognition of products operates on the basis of the acquis communautaire that has been transposed by the partner country, in the same way as it would apply to products placed on the market of a Member State. It allows industrial products covered by it and attested as compliant according to the procedures of the European Union to be placed on the Israeli market without having to undergo any further approval procedures, and vice versa. At present one sector is included: good manufacturing practice (GMP) for pharmaceutical products. Israel has taken over the Community technical legislation in the sector covered by the Annex to the Protocol and participates in the European organisations in the sector covered by it; the second mechanism, i.e., the mutual acceptance of industrial products not commonly regulated, confirms that Articles 16 and 17 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement with Israel apply without other restriction in the product sectors covered by it. That is, Annexes applying this mechanism will provide that where no European technical regulations exist, industrial products listed under such Annexes lawfully traded in the market of either Party (i.e., on the territory of Israel or that of one of the Member States of the EU) may be lawfully traded in the other. No annexes making this mechanism operational are at present included. Main provisions of the Framework Agreement : Purpose and means : the ACAA aims to eliminate technical barriers to trade in respect to industrial products. The ACAA provides for two mechanisms, as described above. Alignment of legislation : Israel has a commitment to take appropriate measures to take over and maintain measures to align with and maintain Community law, as it applies to products covered by the Agreement. For New Approach sectors (which will be explicitly identified as such in the Annexes that relate to them) there is also an obligation on Israel to maintain relevant transposed standards, in the same way as a Member State of the EU. Infrastructure : Israel is committed to establish and maintain a quality infrastructure equivalent to that of the EU for sectors covered by the Protocol. Mutual acceptance of industrial products : the principles of the two mechanisms underlying the mutual acceptance of products onto the market of the other Party, as described above, are detailed in this Agreement. There is also a provision that, unless otherwise agreed, the ACAA does not entail any obligation, for one Party, to accept product attested as compliant by bodies other than those of the Parties. Safeguard clause : each Party has the right to deny market access when that Party is able to demonstrate that a product might endanger legitimate concerns covered by legislation applicable to the products covered by an Annex (mainly to do with safety or public health). The Annexes will provide for the detailed procedures to be used in such cases. Extension of coverage : Parties may modify the scope and coverage of this Protocol through amendment of the Annexes or by the addition of new ones. Obligations of Parties as regards their responsible authorities and notified bodies : Parties are obliged to ensure that their responsible authorities monitor the technical competence and compliance of their respective notified bodies and have power and expertise for designating, suspending, and withdrawing such bodies. In addition, they are obliged to ensure that their notified bodies comply with the requirements of Community and aligned national law, and maintain their technical competence to carry out the tasks for which they have been notified. Notified bodies : a procedure for the notification of bodies to assess conformity in relation to the legal requirements specified in the corresponding annexes is provided. The procedure is similar to the one applied within the Community. It also sets out the procedure for the withdrawal of notified bodies. Verification of notified bodies : each Party has the right to request a verification of a body notified by the other Party. The verification may be done either by the authorities which have designated the body or together by the authorities of both Parties. The notified body would be suspended until a final decision is taken. Exchange of information : measures are provided as regards the transparency provision. This provision ensures uniform application and interpretation of the Protocol. It also provides for the Parties to encourage their notified bodies to co-operate to establish mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sphere. Confidentiality : this standard provision prohibits disclosing information acquired under this Protocol. Management of the Agreement : responsibility for the effective functioning of this Agreement shall be borne by the Committee (subcommittee ""Industry, trade and services"" - set up and designated for trade purposes under Article 73 of the Association Agreement). Its main tasks shall be to add and amend Annexes, appoint experts for verifications, consider new arrangements, and resolve questions related to the Protocol. Technical co-operation and assistance : measures are provided as regards technical co-operation and assistance with a view to properly implementing this Protocol. Agreements with other countries : the agreement can be extended to other countries by explicit agreement, and encourages - but does not force - Israel to make agreements similar to the Protocol, and covering the same products, that the EU might make with another country. Annexes annex on Mutual Acceptance of Industrial Products: there is one Annex, covering good manufacturing practice (GMP) for pharmaceutical products. It operates by the mechanism described above whereby mutual recognition of products operates on the basis of the acquis communautaire that has been transposed by Israel. Advanced therapy products, special medicinal products based on tissues and cells of human origin, and medicinal products that include blood products shall not be concerned. The inclusion of these fields may be agreed between the Parties if the Israeli legislation governing them is brought into alignment; annexes on Mutual Acceptance of Industrial Products no commonly regulated: no such annexes have been negotiated for the moment. The ACAA provides nevertheless the basis for such acceptance of products. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the European Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, was signed in Luxemburg on 29 April 2008. It will enter into force when the Parties notify each other that their respective ratification procedures have been completed. The Interim Agreement (IA) between the same parties, signed on the same date to allow the early application of trade and trade-related provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), entered into force on 1 February 2010. With the aim of the correct and smooth application of the IA, an Implementing Regulation is proposed, to lay down rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of these Agreements, as has been done for previous SAAs and Interim Agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to lay down rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Interim Agreement, as well as the procedures for the adoption of detailed rules of implementation. Since the trade and trade-related provisions of these instruments are to a very large extent identical, this Regulation should also apply to the implementation of the SAA after its entry into force. Scope of the application measures : the SAA and the IA stipulate that certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Serbia may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. This proposal lays down provisions regulating the management of these tariff quotas. Implementation powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Interim Agreement and the SAA, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Given that the implementing measures form part of the common commercial policy, the examination procedure should be used for their adoption. In certain circumstances defined in the proposal, the Commission should adopt immediately such implementing acts. Other technical provisions relating to the implementation of trade defence measures : Where trade defence measures become necessary, they should be adopted in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 on the common rules for imports, Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 establishing common rules for exports, Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community. Notification of fraud and failure to provide administrative cooperation : where a Member State provides information to the Commission on a possible fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant community legislation shall apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directives on the marketing of fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of oil and fibre plants regulate the internal marketing of seed for sowing of the plant species as listed by those Directives. To facilitate trades and to respond promptly to the marketing request, those Directives provide for the Council to establish rules for authorising the importation of seed under an equivalence system from third countries. Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that for a limited period, field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops of certain species are considered as equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union legislation and that seed of certain species produced in third countries is considered as equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union legislation. It appears that those field inspections continue to afford the same guarantees as those carried out by the Member States. Those field inspections should therefore continue to be considered as equivalent. As Decision 2003/17/EC will expire on 31 December 2012, the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision should be extended. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provided the list of countries to be recognised for the application of the equivalence principle for importation, detailed requirements to be fulfilled, and in particular limited to five years the period for which equivalence recognition is to be extended if all the relevant requirements are fulfilled. That period will expire on 31 December 2012. Currently, the temporary extension is envisaged for only 5 years. However, the revision of the new Regulation on seeds and reproductive materials (under co- decision procedures) will be launched in September 2012, with specific implementing measures to be adopted thereafter. In order to ensure the necessary supply of seed to the EU market, the Commission proposes to extend these rules by ten years, until 31 December 2022. The proposal also aims to delete the reference to Yugoslavia in Decision 2003/17/EC. Serbia, as a member of the OECD Scheme for the Varietal Certification of Seed moving in International Trades and member of the International Seed Testing Association as regards the seed sampling and testing, will be added to the list of third countries in Annex I to Decision 2003/17/EC. Lastly, the proposal updates the names of some authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation Brussels I is the basis for civil judicial cooperation in the EU. It applies in a broad range of matters, covering not only contractual but also delict and proprietary claims. It identifies the most appropriate jurisdiction for solving a cross-border dispute and ensures the smooth recognition and enforcement of judgments issued in another Member State. While the Regulation is overall considered to work successfully, the consultation of stakeholders and a number of studies revealed deficiencies in the current operation of the Regulation which should be remedied. Essentially, four main shortcomings can be identified: the procedure for recognition and enforcement of a judgment in another Member State (""exequatur"") remains an obstacle to the free circulation of judgments. It entails unnecessary costs and delays for the parties involved and deters companies and citizens from making full use of the internal market; access to justice in the EU is overall unsatisfactory in disputes involving defendants from outside the EU. With some exceptions, the current Regulation only applies where the defendant is domiciled within the EU. Otherwise jurisdiction is governed by national law. The diversity of national law leads to unequal access to justice for EU companies in transactions with partners from third countries: some can easily litigate in the EU, others cannot, even in situations where no other court guaranteeing a fair trial is competent. In addition, where national legislation does not grant access to court in disputes with parties outside the EU, the enforcement of mandatory EU law protecting e.g. consumers, employees or commercial agents is not guaranteed; the efficiency of choice of court agreements needs to be improved. Currently, the Regulation obliges the court designated by the parties in a choice of court agreement to stay proceedings if another court has been seised first. This rule enables litigants acting in bad faith to delay the resolution of the dispute in the agreed forum by first seizing a non-competent court. This possibility creates additional costs and delays and undermines the legal certainty and predictability of dispute resolution; the interface between arbitration and litigation needs to be improved. Arbitration is excluded from the scope of the Regulation. However, by challenging an arbitration agreement before a court, a party may effectively undermine the arbitration agreement and create a situation of inefficient parallel court proceedings which may lead to irreconcilable resolutions of the dispute. This leads to additional costs and delays, undermines the predictability of dispute resolution and creates incentives for abusive litigation tactics. LEGAL BASE: Article 81 (2) (a), (c) and (e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed the costs and benefits of the main aspects of the proposed reform in its Impact Assessment which accompanies the proposal. CONTENT: the objective of the proposal is to remove the remaining obstacles to the free movement of judicial decisions in line with the principle of mutual recognition. The proposed elements of the reform are as follows: Abolition of the intermediate procedure for the recognition and enforcement of judgments (exequatur): today, judicial cooperation and the level of trust among Member States has reached a degree of maturity which permits the move towards a simpler, less costly, and more automatic system of circulation of judgments, removing the existing formalities among Member States. The proposal therefore abolishes the exequatur procedure for all judgments covered by the Regulation's scope with the exception of judgments in defamation and compensatory collective redress cases. The abolition of exequatur will be accompanied by procedural safeguards which ensure that the defendant's right to a fair trial and his rights of defence are adequately protected. The proposal outlines remedies available to a defendant to enable him to prevent, in exceptional circumstances, a judgment given in one Member State taking effect in another Member State. These safeguards address the situations which are currently addressed by certain of the existing refusal grounds, in particular in order to ensure the protection of the rights of the defence, with the key difference that control of substantive public policy is abolished. As such, the time and costs of the exequatur procedure will be saved while the protection of defendants is ensured. The proposal also contains a series of standard forms which aim at facilitating the recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment in the absence of the exequatur procedure as well as the application for a review under the procedure safeguarding the rights of defence. These forms will facilitate the enforcement of the judgment by the competent authorities, in particular where interest and costs have to be calculated. They also reduce the need for a translation of the judgment and ease the application for a review of the judgment by the defendant who has to act in another Member State. Extension of the jurisdiction rules of the Regulation to disputes involving third country defendants: this amendment will generally extend the ability of companies and citizens to sue third country defendants in the EU because the special rules of jurisdiction which e.g. establish jurisdiction at the place of contractual performance become available in these cases. More specifically, the amendment will ensure that the protective jurisdiction rules available for consumers, employees and insured will also apply if the defendant is domiciled outside the EU. The proposal further harmonises the subsidiary jurisdiction rules and creates two additional fora for disputes involving defendants domiciled outside the EU: it provides that a non-EU defendant can be sued at the place where moveable assets belonging to him are located provided their value is not disproportionate to the value of the claim and that the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court seised; the courts of a Member State will be able to exercise jurisdiction if no other forum guaranteeing the right to a fair trial is available and the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State concerned (""forum necessitatis""). The proposal introduces a discretionary lis pendens rule for disputes on the same subject matter and between the same parties which are pending before the courts in the EU and in a third country. A court of a Member State can exceptionally stay proceedings if a non-EU court was seised first and it is expected to decide within a reasonable time and the decision will be capable of recognition and enforcement in that Member State. This amendment aims at avoiding parallel proceedings within and outside the EU. Enhancement of the effectiveness of choice of court agreements : the proposal includes two amendments with this in mind: where the parties have designated a particular court to resolve their dispute, the proposal gives priority to the chosen court to decide on its jurisdiction, regardless of whether it is first or second seised. Any other court has to stay proceedings until the chosen court has established or – in case the agreement is invalid – declined jurisdiction; the proposal introduces a harmonised conflict of law rule on the substantive validity of choice of court agreements, thus ensuring a similar outcome on this matter whatever the court seised. Improvement of the interface between the Regulation and arbitration : the proposal obliges a court seised of a dispute to stay proceedings if its jurisdiction is contested on the basis of an arbitration agreement and an arbitral tribunal has been seised of the case or court proceedings relating to the arbitration agreement have been commenced in the Member State of the seat of the arbitration. This modification will enhance the effectiveness of arbitration agreements in Europe, prevent parallel court and arbitration proceedings, and eliminate the incentive for abusive litigation tactics. Better coordination of proceedings before the courts of Member States : the proposal contains the following provisions: it aims at improving the general lis pendens rule by prescribing a time limit for the court first seised to decide on its jurisdiction. In addition, the amendment provides for an exchange of information between the courts seised of the same matter; it facilitates the consolidation of related actions by doing away with the requirement that consolidation has to be possible under national law; regarding provisional, and protective measures, the proposal provides for the free circulation of those measures which have been granted by a court having jurisdiction on the substance of the case, including – subject to certain conditions – measures which have been granted ex parte. By contrast, the proposal prevents the circulation of provisional measures ordered by a court other than the one having jurisdiction on the substance. Given the wide divergence of national law on this issue, the effect of these measures should be limited to the territory of the Member State where they were granted, thereby preventing the risk of abusive forum-shopping; if proceedings on the substance are pending in one court and another one is asked to issue a provisional measure, the proposal requires the two courts to cooperate in order to ensure that all circumstances of the case are taken into account when a provisional measure is granted. Improvement of access to justice for certain specific disputes: provisions include: the creation of a forum for claims of rights in rem at the place where moveable assets are located; the possibility for employees to bring actions against multiple defendants in the employment area. This will benefit employees who wish to bring proceedings against joint employers established in different Member States; the possibility of concluding a choice of court agreement for disputes concerning the tenancy of premises for professional use, and the mandatory information of a defendant entering an appearance about the legal consequences of not contesting the court's jurisdiction. and clarification of the conditions under which provisional and protective measures can circulate in the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: home-made explosives, fabricated from certain easily accessible chemical precursors, are a preferred tool for perpetrators of terrorist attacks. Currently, the general public has relatively easy access to these chemicals even when in concentrations sufficient to produce a powerful explosive device. The scale of the problem is amplified by the fact that the chemical market in the EU is large and diversified, with multiple end-users. Some Member States have already adopted either voluntary or legislative measures to reduce the availability of the chemical precursors to explosives, or a combination of both. Some Member States are considering such measures but are waiting for the EU to provide leadership. While several legislative and non-legislative measures exist at international, EU and national level, these either do not specifically focus on the security risks associated with certain chemicals or do not cover the entire EU. This implies that precursors that may be restricted or controlled in one country can be easily obtained in another. The current differences among the regimes applied to chemical precursors to explosives not only have a negative effect on security but also distort the functioning of the internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the options considered included: (i) voluntary measures by the private sector (industry and retail); (ii) regulatory action carried out by the Member States individually; (iii) legislative measures at the EU level; (iv) a combination of these. Several policy options for legislative action at EU level have undergone a thorough impact assessment and consultation process. The preferred policy option has positive impacts in terms of security, but also some negative economic impacts in particular on the retail sector and on public authorities of the Member States in terms of costs of implementation. However, these economic impacts and negative impacts on consumers are relatively minor as non-professional consumption of the precursors only accounts for about 1.5% of total EU consumption of the chemicals concerned, and substitutes are in most cases available. It should be noted that the proposal was subject to an in-depth scrutiny to ensure that its provisions are fully compatible with fundamental rights and principles enshrined in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and notably the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property and the principle of non-discrimination. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. A regulation is the appropriate instrument to achieve maximum harmonisation for the chemicals covered by the legal instrument, and also, where applicable, concentrations of these chemicals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes harmonised rules concerning the making available on the market of substances or mixtures that could be misused for the illicit manufacture of explosives, with a view to limiting their availability to the general public. This will be done by prohibiting the sales of certain chemicals above concentration thresholds to members of the general public. Sales of higher concentrations would only be allowed to users who can document a legitimate need to use the chemical — these users can obtain a licence to purchase the chemical. The sales of these chemicals and their mixtures as well as the sales of products containing chemicals of concern for which concentration thresholds cannot be set will also be subject to reporting of suspicious transactions. The substances and concentration thresholds are clearly set out in the Annex to the Regulation. Each Member State shall ensure that the processing of personal data carried out in application of this Regulation shall be in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC. In particular, each Member State shall ensure that the processing of personal data required by the granting of license, and the reporting of suspicious transactions shall comply with Directive 95/46/EC. Reasonably long transitional periods are foreseen so as to allow members of the general public and economic operators to adapt to the new requirements. The proposed legislative action will be accompanied by voluntary measures by industry and the retail sector to enhance security and raise awareness in the entire supply chain. The proposal is in line with the policy objectives set out in the EU Counter terrorism Strategy, the Action Plan on Enhancing the Security of Explosives and the Stockholm Programme — An open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the European Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: European Parliament and Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: type-approval requirements for new vehicles of the L-category are currently set out in Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (the ‘Framework Directive’). In addition, a series of Directives referred to in the Framework Directive contain detailed technical requirements relating to L-category vehicles. The Commission has identified a number of key concerns associated with the current provisions for the type-approval of new L-category vehicles, which need to be addressed: the complexity of the legal framework; the level of emissions and its increasing share in total road transport emissions, which are decreasing overall; vehicle functional safety aspects related to type-approval requirements; the lack of a legal framework for vehicles fitted with new technologies; selling and registration of certain vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units imported in the EU market which do not comply with the current type-approval requirements regarding vehicle functional safety and/or environmental protection. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: for each of the main aspects of the proposal, different options were analysed by listing possible advantages and disadvantages in terms of economic, environmental, safety and societal aspects. Qualitative and quantitative aspects were both included in this analysis. Next, the different options were compared and one preferred option or a logical combination of two preferred options were identified and described. These preferred options form the basis for this new Framework Regulation. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal uses the ‘split-level approach’ originally introduced at the request of Parliament and used in other legislation for EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach provides for legislation in three steps: the fundamental provisions and scope are laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on Article 114 TFEU in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. the technical specifications associated with the fundamental provisions are laid down in three delegated acts (Article 290), adopted through comitology: an implementing act (Article 291) sets out the administrative provisions, such as the information document, the definitions of the type-approval certificate, the certificate of conformity and associated production conformity requirements, etc. This proposal for a Regulation relates to the first step of this process. It establishes the administrative and technical requirements for the approval and market surveillance of all new L-category vehicles that are intended to travel on public roads, including where designed and constructed in more than one stage. It also establishes the requirements for the sale and entry into service of systems, components and separate technical units intended for vehicles approved in accordance with this Regulation. In the interests of clarity, rationality and simplification, Directive 2002/24/EC and its separate directives should be repealed and replaced by one Regulation and a small number of delegated and implementing acts. This Regulation constitutes a set of specific safety and environmental requirements. It establishes provisions to ensure that, in cases where a vehicle presents a serious risk for users or the environment, the manufacturer or any other economic operator in the supply chain has taken effective protective measures, including the recall of vehicles. In addition, appropriate measures should be taken in order to make sure that systems, components or separate technical units which can be fitted to vehicles, and which could significantly impair the functioning of systems that are essential for environmental protection or functional safety, are subject to prior control by an approval authority before they are sold, registered or are entering into service. To improve market surveillance, the role and responsibilities of the authorities in the Member States in charge of type-approval and market surveillance are clarified. The proposal also reinforces the requirements relating to the competence, obligations and performance of the technical services that perform vehicle type-approval. In order to prevent misuse, any simplified procedure for small-series vehicles should be restricted to cases of very limited production. It is therefore necessary to define precisely the concept of small series in terms of the number of vehicles sold, registered and entered into service. In order to ensure that the procedure for monitoring conformity of production is correctly implemented and functions properly, manufacturers should be regularly checked by the competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service appointed for that purpose. Lastly, Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the European Union budget with regard to the first two emission-limit reduction steps (Euro 4 and 5 for motorcycles, Euro 3 and 4 for all other L-category vehicle categories). The third emission step will include a Euro 6 step motorcycles and a Euro 5 step for all other L-category vehicle categories (mopeds, tricycles and quadricycles). These limits are absolutely equivalent to the Euro 5 emission limits for passenger cars. An additional environmental effect study is planned in order to determine the short-term environmental effects of the Euro 3, 4 and 5 steps and whether the targeted Euro 6 step is appropriate within the given time. This study will be completed in the period 2016-2017 and will be financed through the Commission budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the technical requirements for the type-approval of tractors with regard to numerous safety and environmental elements have been harmonised at the level of the Union in order to avoid requirements that differ from one Member State to another, to ensure a high level of road and occupational safety and environmental protection throughout the Community and to allow for a harmonized system of EU type-approval. The existing type-approval legislation for tractors is regulated in the following EU-acts: Council Directives 74/347/EEC, 76/432/EEC, 76/763/EEC, 77/537/EEC, 78/764/EEC, 80/720/EEC, 86/297/EEC, 86/298/EEC, 86/415/EEC, 87/402/EEC; European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/25/EC, 2003/37/EC, 2009/57/EC, 2009/58/EC, 2009/59/EC, 2009/60/EC, 2009/61/EC, 2009/63/EC, 2009/64/EC, 2009/66/EC, 2009/68/EC, 2009/75/EC, 2009/76/EC and 2009/144/EC. New technologies like ABS (anti-lock braking systems) are now available and can be implemented in the near future, which will dramatically improve vehicle safety. Research has indicated that there would be significant benefits if such technologies were introduced as standard on new vehicles. Setting common mandatory requirements would also prevent the fragmentation of the internal market resulting from varying product standards emerging across Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : or each of the main aspects of the proposal, different options were considered: Simplification aspects – I: Directives or Regulations: a) no change in policy. This would mean that the existing 24 Directives would be maintained with additional amendments when necessary; b) replace existing separate Directives by one Regulation; c) replace existing Directives by one Regulation and a limited number of thematic delegated and implementing acts. This is the chosen option. Simplification aspect – II: all in detailed EU legislation or reference to international standards: a) no change in policy. This would mean that the existing 24 Directives would be maintained with additional amendments when necessary. The Directives would continue to operate in parallel with the existing UNECE Regulations and OECD Codes with the technical requirements usually (but not always) being the same. This is currently the cause of much confusion for stakeholders who are not closely involved with the type-approval system, and leads to a situation of a regulatory system that is less than fully transparent; b) replace existing separate Directives where possible by equivalent UNECE Regulations. c) Replace existing separate Directives where possible by equivalent UNECE Regulations, or OECD Codes (roll-over protection systems) or possibly CEN/CENELEC or ISO standards. This is the chosen option since it would maximise the advantages of simplification at the benefit, in particular, of national authorities and industry. Completion of the internal market a) no change in policy. This would mean that bit-by-bit the package as provided in Directive 2003/37/EC would be completed. b) complete the EU TA requirements and make EU WVTA mandatory for all categories; c) complete the EU TA requirements but leave EU WVTA optional for certain categories (T4, T5, C, R and S). LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal significantly simplifies the type-approval legislation by replacing 24 base Directives (and around 35 related amending Directives) in the field of agricultural and forestry vehicle technical requirements with one Regulation. It aims to lay down harmonised rules on the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles (tractors, trailers and towed equipment) with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market while at the same time providing for a high level of road and occupational safety and environmental protection. This will also contribute to the competitiveness of the industry by simplifying the existing vehicle type-approval legislation, improving transparency and easing administrative burden. The draft regulation and its implementing and delegated acts will carry over the existing requirements laid down in the above acts. It will also lay down in detail the new mandatory requirements on braking. In particular, the delegated acts adopted under this proposal will require amongst others: mandatory fitting of anti-lock braking systems on some categories (T5 fast tractors and their trailers suitable for speeds over 40 km/h); compatibility between tractor and trailers/towed equipment. As far as the environmental aspects of the proposal are concerned, no changes are proposed to the existing levels of protection. The only change is that the Regulation should refer to Directive 97/68/EC on emissions of Non-Road Mobile Machinery instead of having a specific one for tractors, simplifying the current implementation process while keeping the key features for future developments. It should be noted that the proposal uses the “split-level approach” that was originally introduced at the request of the European Parliament and used in other pieces of legislation in the area of EU type approval of motor vehicles. 1) the fundamental provisions will be laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union through the ordinary legislative procedure; 2) the technical specifications implementing the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: negotiations under Article XXVIII of GATT 1994 concluded on poultry in 2007 covered tariff lines on poultry meat under heading 0210 as well as one processed poultry line, 1602 32 19 in the EC Schedule CXL: cooked preparations containing more than 57% of poultry meat. Limiting the negotiations to the processed poultry line 1602 32 19 was considered to sufficiently prevent potential substitution effects. Subsequent import data, however, showed a dramatic import surge of processed poultry meat under tariff line 1602 32 30: preparations containing 25% or more but less than 57% by weight of poultry meat or offal. This indicated that exporters seemed to take advantage of a relative gap in the EU level of protection, substituting poultry preparations containing more than 57% of poultry meat with preparations containing less than 57%, under tariff line 1602 32 30. Comparable substitution effects were to be expected under other 1602 tariff lines in the future. In order comprehensively to address these substitution effects affecting the EU poultry industry, the Commission requested from the Council the authorisation to renegotiate the concessions on poultry meat under Chapter 16 of the CN. The Commission has negotiated with the Federal Republic of Brazil and with the Kingdom of Thailand, each holding principal supplying interests and/or substantial interests in various of the tariff lines concerned. The negotiations have resulted in Agreements in the form of exchanges of letters initialled with Thailand on 22 November 2011 and with Brazil on 7 December 2011. The agreements were negotiated on the basis of the Combined Nomenclature codes in force at the time. In the newest version of Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff as laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1006/2011 published in OJ L 282 of 28 October 2011, the tariff lines 1602 39 40 and 1602 39 80 have been merged into a new tariff line 1602 39 85. It is therefore appropriate to reflect this new situation in the present implementing regulation. The autonomous Customs duty rates for the tariff lines covered by the negotiations are currently set at levels below the new conventional duty rates resulting from the modification of concessions pursuant to Article XXVIII of GATT 1994. However, under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff, the autonomous customs duties apply when they are below the conventional duties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) TFEU. CONTENT: following the negotiations opened under Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 in mid-2009 with Brazil and Thailand, this proposal concerns the implementation of the Agreements between the European Union and Brazil and Thailand respectively in order to deal with the problem of l substitution effects in the import of poultry. The implementation of the Agreements concern : an increase in the out-of-quota rates for 7 tariff lines of processed poultry meat products, and, opening TRQs for the same 7 tariff lines of processed poultry meat products, for Brazil, Thailand and other countries. This proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a Council decision regarding the conclusion of agreements between the European Union and Brazil and Thailand respectively in order to deal with the problem of substitution effects in the import of poultry. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the import volume of the quota is similar to the quantity imported prior to this agreement. There is no effect on the internal market balance that could lead to needs for market instruments. In case of import of the total quota under this draft regulation, it can be estimated that the measure could involve a reduction of own resources of an approximated net amount of EUR 1.4 million, after deduction of 25% of collection costs by Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Salmon Action Plan, adopted through the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission in 1997, expired in 2010. Contracting parties to the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) have urged the EU to develop a long term plan for the management of Baltic salmon. Recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries (STECF) state that some Baltic salmon river stocks are outside safe biological limits and that a multiannual plan should be developed at European level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers that the proposed measures will achieve the following objectives: rebuilding all wild Baltic salmon rivers' stocks to safe biological limits and favourable conservation statues by limiting the fishing pressure on weak salmon river stocks; re-establishing self-sustaining salmon populations in rivers with extirpated or very weak populations which would lead to higher overall wild salmon production; safeguarding the genetic diversity of wild salmon as stocking of reared salmon with potential negative genetic effect will be substantially decreased; predictability of fishing opportunities as a result of clear harvest control rules; increased production of wild salmon and recovery of all wild rivers stocks which will in the long term give increased fishing opportunities; benefits for the tourism sector with the potential to grow due to increased fishing opportunities of wild salmon both at sea and in rivers. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he objective of the proposal is to establish a multiannual plan for the management of the fisheries on the salmon stocks in the Baltic Sea to ensure that the conservation status of the entire Baltic stock, i.e. including all salmon rivers' stocks, is favourable and provide for sustainable exploitation. The specific objectives of the initiative shall be to ensure that: (a) the Baltic salmon stock is exploited in a sustainable way according to the principle of maximum sustainable yield; (b) the genetic integrity and diversity of the Baltic salmon stock is safeguarded. The main elements of the plan are: o bjectives, and targets (reach 75% of potential smolt production in each wild salmon river within ten years after the entry into force of this regulation); TAC based on constant fishing mortality rate of 0.1. The TAC will only cover marine fisheries but will include masters of non-fishing vessels offering services for recreational fisheries; obligation for Member States to define and implement technical conservation measures such as closed areas and seasons to protect migrating spawners in their coastal waters not later than 24 months from the entry into force of the plan; a phasing out of release of salmon in rivers with man made obstacles and without potential for re-establishment of self sustaining wild salmon populations in order to protect the genetic diversity of the wild stocks; financial assistance from the EFF for direct restocking of rivers with potential for self-sustaining wild salmon populations as a conservation measure for the wild salmon stock. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has led to significant changes both in the framework for the adoption of delegated and implementing acts and for the conduct of trade policy. As regards the adoption of delegated and implementing acts the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union clearly distinguishes between the two: the provisions of the Treaty on delegated acts, which are set out in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, provide for the legislator to control the exercise of the Commission's powers by means of a right of revocation and/or a right of objection; the provisions of the Treaty on implementing acts, which are set out in Article 291, do not provide any role for the European Parliament and the Council to control the Commission's exercise of implementing powers. Such control can only be exercised by the Member States. A legal framework establishing the mechanisms of such control is set out in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers. As regards trade policy, the Treaty of Lisbon provides that the ordinary legislative procedure applies, meaning that for the first time the European Parliament is fully associated in the conduct of trade policy. In relation to the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 the Commission stated that it will proceed to an examination of all legislative acts in force which were not adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in order to assess if those instruments need to be adapted to the regime of delegated acts introduced by Article 290 of the TFEU. It will make the appropriate proposals as soon as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he present proposal results from the Commission's examination of the legislative acts in the field of trade policy. Legislation in the field of trade policy has not been adapted in the past to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. This proposal accompanies a first proposal the Commission has made on trade policy, referred to as ""Trade Omnibus I"") amends certain regulations relating to the common commercial policy as regards procedures where the Council was involved in decision-making which were not based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. It proposes that such procedures be converted into either delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty or implementing acts pursuant to Article 291. The current proposal examines all remaining decision-making procedures found in trade policy legislation in order to adapt them, where appropriate, to the regime for delegated acts set down in Article 290. In principle these are decision-making procedures based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC. The proposal concerns 10 basic acts. Where appropriate, the Commission proposes that certain procedures be converted into delegated acts as set down in Article 290."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels establishes a general prohibition to the practice of 'shark finning', whereby the fins are removed from sharks, with the remainder of the shark being discarded at sea. In recent years, some shark populations have been severely targeted and put under serious threat as a result of a dramatic increase in demand for shark products, fins in particular. The EU has made several international commitments to protect sharks, in line with the Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and in particular under the International Plan of Action on Sharks (IPOA-Sharks)adopted by the FAO in 1999. The FAO IPOA was the basis for the 2009 Commission Communication on a European Community Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, whereby the Union committed itself to adopt all necessary measures for the conservation of sharks and to minimize waste and discards from shark catches. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the European Commission held a public consultation of stakeholders and the general public, between 2010 and 2011, in order to gather information on the most appropriate manner in which Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 should be amended. The results of the consultation show that the 'fins-remain-attached' approach is regarded as the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 allows Member States to issue special fishing permits allowing processing on board, whereby shark fins can be removed from the bodies. In order to ensure the correspondence between the weight of fins and bodies, a 'fin-to-carcass' weight ratio is established. However, given that such processing takes place on board vessels, fins and bodies can be landed in different ports. Inspectors must rely on logbook records to determine whether or not the fin allowance has been respected. In such cases, and given the varying levels of control and enforcement in ports around the world where such landings take place, 'shark finning' can and does occur, and is often difficult to detect, let alone prove in legal proceedings. Under these circumstances, the collection of data (e.g. species identification, population structure) underpinning scientific advice for the establishment of fisheries management and conservation measures is hampered. The Scientific, Technical, and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) acknowledges the problem of shark finning and calls for its eradication without exemption, and advises that all elasmobranch species should be landed with fins /wings attached. Regional Fisheries Management Organisations are increasingly addressing the issue of shark finning and their scientific bodies are showing preference for the landing of sharks with their fins naturally attached to the body. Therefore, in order to ensure proper management and conservation of shark stocks, it is appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the marked deceleration in growth experienced by the Kyrgyz economy in 2009 (GDP slowed down from an average rate of 8.5% in 2007-08 to 2.3% in 2009) was a consequence of several external shocks, including a fall in remittances from migrant workers, lower demand for exports and shrinking direct and other foreign investments. Before the dramatic events of 2010, economic growth was expected to rebound in 2010 to 4.5-5.5%. However, the 2010 April popular revolt and, more importantly, the escalation of the ethnic conflict in June led to a serious deterioration in the economic outlook. Economic activity contracted by 10% in the second quarter of 2010. In response to last year's political events and their economic implications, the international community organised a High Level Donors Meeting for the Kyrgyz Republic on 27 July 2010 in Bishkek. At this conference, donors committed to provide USD 1.1 billion in emergency support by the end of 2011. The EU was among the major donors, pledging €117.9 million for support in a number of critical areas. The IMF in June 2011 agreed with the Kyrgyz authorities on an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) of SDR 66.6 million (USD 106 million) in support of a three-year programme of macroeconomic adjustment and structural reforms. In 2010, the President and the Minister of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic formally requested the EU macro-financial assistance (MFA) to complement the support from the IMF. In this context, the Commission has assessed the macroeconomic situation and financing needs of the Kyrgyz Republic. The main conclusions of the assessment are that last year’s tragic political events and the related social and reconstruction expenditure have left important external and fiscal financing needs for the period 2011-12. While these needs are being partly covered by the international community, there are still substantial residual needs. In order to supplement the resources made available by the IMF, the Commission proposes providing a MFA in the amount of up to EUR 30 million to the Kyrgyz Republic to be disbursed half in loans and half in grants. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the impact assessment, t he MFA and the economic adjustment and reform programme attached to it will help alleviate the Kyrgyz Republic's short-term financing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening medium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability and raising sustainable growth as agreed with the IMF. It will notably help improve the efficiency and transparency of public finance management. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed that the European Union shall make macro-financial assistance available to the Kyrgyz Republic for a maximum amount of €30 million, with a view to supporting the country's economic stabilisation and covering its balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF programme. Of this amount, up to €15 million shall be provided in the form of loans and up to €15 million in the form of grants. The release of the proposed macro-financial assistance is subject to the approval of the 2012 Budget by the budgetary authority. The conditions attached the granting of the macro-financial assistance shall be consistent with the principles and fundamental objectives of the Union policy as regards this country. These are as follows: the Commission is empowered to borrow the necessary resources on behalf of the European Union in order to finance the loan component of the Union's macro-financial assistance; the loan shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years; the assistance shall be made available for two years; the release of the Union's financial assistance shall be managed by the Commission; specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable; the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the first semester of 2012. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the second semester of 2012; the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the IMF's financial arrangement (the ECF); the Commission and the Kyrgyz authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. It should be noted that the decision to disburse half of the proposed assistance in grants and the other half in loans is justified by Kyrgyz level of development (as measured by its per-capita income) and debt indicators. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the grant element of the assistance (€15 million) would be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2012 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), with payments taking place in 2012. In line with the Guarantee Fund Regulation, the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund is expected to take place in 2014 and to amount to a maximum of €1.35 million. This corresponds to 9% of the €15 million loan expected to be disbursed in 2012."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. BACKGROUND: office equipment will account for a growing share of energy consumption in future as new applications and functionalities appear. In order to meet the Union target for a 20% reduction in primary energy consumption by 2020 relative to projections, as endorsed at the Spring 2007 European Council, the energy performance of office equipment has to be further optimised. Regulation (EC) No 106/2008 sets out the rules for implementing the Energy Star programme for office equipment (computers, displays, printers, copiers, scanners, etc.) in the European Union. The Energy Star programme is implemented in the EU on the basis of an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Community on the coordination of energy efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment, which expired in December 2011. On 12 July 2011 the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a new 5-year agreement and the negotiations were concluded on 29 November 2011. It is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) 106/2008 to adapt the implementation of the Energy Star programme to the new agreement. A proposal for a Council Decision for the signature and conclusion of the new Energy Star Agreement is presented to the Council with this proposal for an amendment of Regulation (EC) 106/2008. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal takes into account the experience gained during the first two periods of implementation of the Energy Star Programme in the EU from 2001 to 2010, as well as the consultations with the European Union Energy Star Board. The detailed rationale for concluding a new Agreement continuing the Energy Star Programme for a third period of five years is set out in the Recommendation from the Commission to the Council to open negotiations for the third Energy Star Agreement and in the Communication on the implementation of the Energy Star Programme in the period 2006-2010. The main points are as follows : · Energy Star has been very effective in steering the office equipment market towards greater energy efficiency. It has succeeded in reducing the electricity consumption of office equipment sold in the last 3 years by around 11 TWh, i.e. by approximately 16 %. As a result, more than EUR 1.8 billion have been saved on energy bills and 3.7 Mt of CO2 emissions have been avoided. · It provides a flexible and dynamic policy framework which is particularly well suited to fast-evolving products such as ICT (information and communication technology). · The EU and the US should continue to cooperate on developing product specifications, so that the same level of requirements can be introduced at approximately the same time by both entities. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(1) TFEU. CONTENT: the primary purpose of this proposal for an amendment of Regulation (EC) 106/2008 is to adapt the implementation of the Energy Star Programme to the new Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Union on the coordination of energy-efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment. The only substantive amendment to the proposal is the deletion of Article 4(4) of Regulation 106/2008, which states that office equipment products for which use of the Common Logo has been granted by USEPA shall be deemed to comply with the Regulation, unless there is evidence to the contrary. Until now, the programme in the EU and the US has operated on the basis of self-certification by manufacturers. The success of the programme in the EU is considered to be partly based on such lightweight product registration procedures. However, the US has decided to move to third-party certification for products placed on the US market. Such an approach is not recommended for the EU market. It could have a negative impact on the programme and place SMEs at a disadvantage in relation to big manufacturers Thus under the new agreement the programme will have to function under two separate product registration systems: products placed on the EU market will need to be registered with the European Commission, while products placed on the US market will need to register through third parties accredited under the US Energy Star Programme. This means that the principle of mutual recognition will no longer be applicable. Other amendments aim at updating the references to existing legislation and to the new agreement, as well as updating the name of the Energy Star Board, and providing a clarification of the responsibilities of the Commission and Member States for the enforcement of the Programme. The strengthening of public procurement provisions will be covered by the proposal for an Energy Efficiency Directive which addresses public procurement in a comprehensive way. The amended Regulation should take into account the provisions on public procurement in this Directive. The Commission will continuously monitor the impact of the changes proposed by the US and of the Energy Star Programme on energy savings, manufacturers and compliance. At least two years before the expiry of a new Agreement, it will analyse possible future options for addressing the energy consumption of office equipment, including replacing Energy Star with alternative policy instruments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal aims at continuing the implementation of an existing programme and therefore has no impact on operational and administrative appropriations and on human resources."

Council Regulation. the current patent system in the EU, in particular in terms of translation requirements, involves very high costs and complexity. The overall cost of validation of an average European patent reaches 12 500 EUR if validated only in 13 Member States and over 32 000 EUR if validated in the whole EU. It is estimated that the actual validation costs are around 193 million EUR per year in the EU. Despite broad recognition of the competitive disadvantage European business faces in the absence of unitary patent protection, the Union has not been able to establish unitary patent protection. The Commission first proposed a Council Regulation on the Community patentin August 2000. On 30 June 2010 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the EU patent. It was confirmed at the Competitiveness Council meeting on 10 December 2010 that insurmountable difficulties existed, making a decision requiring unanimity impossible now and in the foreseeable future. 25 Member States then asked for recourse enhanced cooperation in the area of unitary patent protection (all Member States except Italy and Spain) in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection. was adopted by the Council, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, on 10 March 2011. The present regulation implements the enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection as authorised by Council Decision 2011/167/EU.. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment which analyses the impacts of the following options: Option 1 (base-line scenario): the Commission takes no action; Option 2 : the Commission continues to work with the other institutions towards an EU patent covering 27 Member States; Option 3 : the Commission presents proposals for regulations implementing enhanced cooperation: Sub-option 3.1 - the Commission proposes translation arrangements applicable in the area of unitary patent protection that correspond to its proposal of 30 June 2010, or Sub-option 3.2 - the Commission proposes translation arrangements applicable in the area of unitary patent protection based on its proposal of 30 June 2010 and incorporating elements of a compromise proposal discussed by the Council. The analysis carried out in the impact assessment has demonstrated that option 3 with sub-option 3.2 is the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 118 (1) TFEU provides for the legal basis for creating European intellectual property rights providing uniform protection throughout the Union by means of a regulation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. CONTENT: the proposal aims to implement enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection authorised by Council Decision No 2011/167/EU. The main provisions are as follows : European patent with unitary effect : in comparison to the Commission's proposal in 2000, this proposal builds on the existing system of European patents by providing unitary effect to European patents granted for the territories of the participating Member States. The unitary patent protection will be optional and co-exist with national and European patents. The proprietors of European patents granted by the EPO, may submit a request to the EPO within one month after the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent, asking for the registration of the unitary effect. Once it is registered, the unitary effect will provide uniform protection and will have equal effect throughout the territories of all participating Member States. European patents with unitary effect may only be granted, transferred, revoked or may lapse in respect of those territories as a whole. The participating Member States shall give the task of administrating European patents with unitary effect to the EPO. Rights and limitations : the rights conferred by the European patent with unitary effect should enable the patent proprietor to prevent any third party not having his consent from the direct and indirect use of the invention on the territories of the participating Member States. However, a number of limitations of the patent proprietor's rights should enable third parties to use the invention, for instance for private and for non-commercial purposes, for experimental purposes, for acts allowed specifically under Union law (in the area of veterinary medicinal products, medicinal products for human use, plant variety rights, the legal protection of computer programs by copyright and the legal protection of biotechnological inventions) under international law and for the use by a farmer of protected livestock for farming purposes. Treating a European patent with unitary effect as a national patent : a European patent with unitary effect shall be dealt with in its entirety, and in all the participating Member States, as a national patent of the participating Member State in which, according to the European Patent Register, the proprietor of the patent had his residence or principal place of business on the date of filing of the application for the patent. Where no proprietor has his residence or a place of business in a participating Member State, the European patent with unitary effect as an object of property shall be dealt with as a national patent of the State where the European Patent Organisation has its seat. Licenses of right : the draft regulation enables the proprietor of a European patent with unitary effect to file a statement with the EPO that he is prepared to allow any person to use the invention as a licensee in return for appropriate compensation (contractual license). Renewal fees : renewal fees in respect of European patents with unitary effect shall be paid to the European Patent Organisation. If a renewal fee is not been paid in due time, the European patent with unitary effect shall lapse. The proposal provides that renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect shall be progressive throughout the term of the patent and shall be sufficient not only to cover all costs associated with the grant and administration of the unitary patent protection but also, together with the fees to be paid to the European Patent Organisation during the pre-grant stage, to ensure a balanced budget for the Organisation. The share for distributing 50% of the amount of the renewal fees paid for European patents with unitary effect minus the costs associated with the administration of the unitary patent protection among the participating Member States shall be set by the Commission on the basis of fair, equitable and relevant criteria, i.e the number of patent applications and the size of the market. Participating Member States shall use the amount of the renewal fees allocated to them for patent-related purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions delegating to the Commission the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of the level of the renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect and the distribution of such fees between the European Patent Organisation and the participating Member States."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : on 23 April 2007 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with certain countries of Central America, which resulted in a Association Agreement with Central America. The Agreement was initialled on 22 March 2011. The Agreement includes a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility of reinstating the MFN customs duty rate when, as a result of a trade liberalisation, imports take place in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. Furthermore, the Agreement also incorporates a Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas according to which, until 1 January 2020, preferential customs duties can be suspended when a certain annual import volume is reached. In order for these measures to be operational, the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism should be incorporated in EU, and the procedural aspects of their application as well as the rights of interested parties need to be specified. This is the purpose of the proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT : this proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism of the EU- Central America Association Agreement. 1) Principles on the imposition of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the Regulation where a product originating in a Central American country is, as a result of the reduction or the elimination of the customs duties on that product, being imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: a suspension of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties) to the Agreement; an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the most-favoured-nation (""MFN"") applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of the Agreement. None of these measures shall be applied within the limits of the preferential duty free tariff quotas granted by the Agreement. Initiation of proceedings : an investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to above, to justify such initiation. The request to initiate an investigation shall generally contain the following information: the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment. An investigation may also be initiated in the event that there is a surge of imports concentrated in one or several Member States, provided that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the conditions for initiation are met. The proposal makes provision for the procedures for initiating an investigation and the conditions under which the latter may be done. Investigation : following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation, which shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of its initiation. That time limit may be extended by a further period of three months in exceptional circumstances such as the involvement of an unusually high number of parties, or complex market situations. Prior surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in a Central American country is such that it could lead to a serious threat to the Union market, imports of that product may be subject to prior surveillance measures. Such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in the text. Prior surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in a Central American country have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty. Provisional measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure, including on imperative grounds of urgency. Provisional measures shall be shall not apply for more than 200 days. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that conditions regarding a serious threat to Union industry are met, the Commission shall refer the matter to the Association Committee. Where no recommendation has been made by the Association Committee or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the referral, the Commission may adopt a decision imposing definitive safeguard measures. The text also contains provisions on the termination of investigation and proceeding without measure. Duration and review of safeguard measures : it is provided that a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, and may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the Union industry is adjusting.. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. Confidentiality and transparency : the text contains provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information received pursuant to the Regulation. Information shall in any case be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information. At the same time, when initiating an investigation, provisions are made to ensure transparency, and interested parties and representatives of the Central American country concerned may inspect all information made available to the Commission, which shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable. There ate other provisions to ensure transparency, such as such as the Commission’s obligation to ensure password-protected online access to the non-confidential file through which all information which is not confidential shall be disseminated. The European Parliament shall be granted access to this online platform. 2) Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas: for bananas originating in Central America (fresh Bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category ""ST"" in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties) to the Agreement, a stabilisation mechanism shall apply until 1 January 2020. A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports from Central American country for products as indicated in the table in the Annex to the Regulation. The importation of these products at the preferential customs duty rate shall, in addition to the proof of origin established under Annex III (Definition of the concept of ""originating products"" and methods of administrative co-operation) of the Agreement with Central America, be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the competent authority of the Central American country from which the products are exported. Once the trigger volume is met during the corresponding calendar year, the Commission may temporarily suspend the preferential customs duty during that same year for a period of time not exceeding three months, and not going beyond the end of the calendar year. In case the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, the Commission shall apply the lesser of: (i) the base rate of customs duty or (ii) the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken. In case the Commission applies these actions, it shall immediately enter into consultations with the affected country to analyse and evaluate the situation on the basis of factual available data. These measures may be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : on 19 January 2009 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Member Countries of the Andean Community, which resulted in a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. The Agreement was initialled on 23 March 2011. The Agreement includes a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility to re-instate the MFN customs duty rate when, as a result of a trade liberalisation, imports take place in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. Furthermore, the Agreement also incorporates a Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas according to which, until 1 January 2020, preferential customs duties can be suspended when a certain annual import volume is reached. In order for these measures to be operational, the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism should be incorporated in EU law, and the procedural aspects of their application as well as the rights of interested parties need to be specified. This is the purpose of the proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT : the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism of the EU- Colombia and Peru Free Trade Agreement. 1) Principles on the imposition of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with this Regulation where a product originating in Columbia or Peru is, as a result of tariff concessions on that product under the Agreement, being imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: a suspension of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Tariff Elimination Schedule of the European Union set out in Annex I to the Agreement; an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the most-favoured-nation (""MFN"") applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the base rate as specified in the Tariff Elimination Schedule of the European Union set out in Annex I to the Agreement. Initiation of proceedings : an investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to above, to justify such initiation. The request to initiate an investigation shall generally contain the following information: the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment. An investigation may also be initiated in the event that there is a surge of imports concentrated in one or several Member States, provided that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the conditions for initiation are met. The proposal makes provision for the procedures for initiating an investigation and the conditions under which the latter may be done. Investigation : following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation, which shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of its initiation. That time limit may be extended by a further period of three months in exceptional circumstances such as the involvement of an unusually high number of parties, or complex market situations. Prior surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in Colombia or Peru is such that it could lead to a serious threat to the Union market, imports of that product may be subject to prior surveillance measures. Such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in the text. Prior surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in Colombia or Peru have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty. Provisional measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure, including on imperative grounds of urgency. Provisional measures shall be shall not apply for more than 200 days. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that conditions regarding a serious threat to Union industry are met the Commission shall invite the authorities of Colombia or Peru to hold consultations in accordance with the Agreement. Where no satisfactory solution has been reached within 45 days, the Commission may adopt a decision imposing definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure. The text also contains provisions on the termination of investigation and proceeding without measure. Duration and review of safeguard measures : it is provided that a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, and may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the Union industry is adjusting.. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. Confidentiality and transparency : the text contains provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information received pursuant to the Regulation. Information shall in any case be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information. At the same time, when initiating an investigation, provisions are made to ensure transparency, and interested parties and representatives of Colombia and Peru may inspect all information made available to the Commission, which shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable. There ate other provisions to ensure transparency, such as such as the Commission’s obligation to ensure password-protected online access to the non-confidential file through which all information which is not confidential shall be disseminated. The European Parliament shall be granted access to this online platform. 2) Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas: for bananas originating in Colobia and Peru (fresh Bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category ""BA"" in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I to the Agreement, a stabilisation mechanism shall apply until 1 January 2020. A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports of products as indicated in the Annex to the Regulation. Once the trigger volume for either Colombia or Peru is met during the corresponding calendar year, the Commission may, in accordance with the examination procedure, temporarily suspend the preferential customs duty applied to products of the corresponding origin during that same year for a period of time not exceeding three months, and not going beyond the end of the calendar year. In case the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, the Commission shall apply the lesser of: (i) the base rate of customs duty or (ii) the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken. In case the Commission applies these actions, it shall immediately enter into consultations with the affected country y (either Colombia or Peru or both) to analyse and evaluate the situation on the basis of factual available data. These measures may be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it is increasingly becoming recognised that freedom from crime and from feelings of personal insecurity is an important aspect of citizens' well-being. Until now, there is no survey data on crime and safety of individuals and households covering the whole EU. Administrative data on crime (based on police reports etc.) have been collected on an informal basis and published since 2006. It is generally acknowledged that such data have restricted comparability due to the differing legal systems and recording methods in the Member States, and that the potential for overcoming these difficulties is limited. The European Council highlighted the lack of comparable information at EU level on crime in the Hague Programme in 2005. In response, the Commission drew up an Action Plan 2006-2010 on improving methods to measure crime, which included developing an EU household survey on crime victimisation. The Stockholm Programme (2009) underlined the need to follow up this work with practical implementation. It is therefore proposed to conduct in 2013 an EU-level survey based on the methodology which has now been agreed with the stakeholders. It would make available information on the prevalence of specific types of crime (victimisation rates) and on other aspects relating to citizens’ feelings of security. This would provide a valuable addition to crime figures from administrative sources (such as police reports), which are known to be difficult to compare between Member States. ANALYSIS OF EFFECTS AND IMPLICATIONS: the proposed survey on crime and safety will for the first time make available information from every Member State on a topic which is of central importance to EU policy concerns. The use of common methodologies and reporting formats will make data available which will be coherent, comparable and thus relevant for users at both European and national level. The Member States will play a key role in this exercise through the involvement of national statistical authorities, which have well-established procedures for collecting and processing survey data. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he objective of this Regulation is to establish a common framework for producing European statistics on safety from crime, via the collection, compilation, processing and transmission by the Member States of harmonised European data on crime and safety based upon a household/personal survey. The aim of the proposal is to harmonise concepts, subjects covered and characteristics of the required information, coverage, quality criteria and reporting deadlines and results, to achieve relevant, timely, comparable and coherent European statistics. Member States will collect the data using their own national sampling frames, and will also select the interview mode (face-to-face interviews, telephone, postal, web-based, etc.) in line with established national practices. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal implies expenditure of EUR 12 million in 2012 from the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the implementation of the Slot Regulation has significantly improved slot allocation at busy European airports in terms of neutrality and transparency, making a major contribution to the creation of the internal market in aviation. Nowadays, however, there is much more competition. Since 1992, the number of intra-EU routes operated has more than doubled and there has been a 150 % increase in long-haul flights departing from European airports. In 1992, just 93 European routes were served by more than two airlines. In 2010 there were 479 such routes. The slot-allocation system established in 1993 does not ensure the optimum allocation and use of slots and thus of airport capacity. As highlighted by Eurocontrol and ACI-Europe, one of the key challenges facing Europe is airport congestion. According to Eurocontrol's Long Term Forecast in December 2010, even taking into account currently planned infrastructure enhancements, as much as 10% of demand for air transport will remain unmet in 2030 due to a shortage of airport capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to review the Slot Regulation to determine to what extent it can be improved with a view to matching capacity to demand for air transport in all sectors (long-haul, regional, cargo, etc.). This initiative is one of the actions necessary for the Single European Transport Area as described in the Commission's White Paper: Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area — Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system. It is also part of the airport package of measures identified as a strategic initiative in the 2011 Commission Work Programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three packages is as follows: · the first policy package included measures to improve the effectiveness of slot allocation and the use of slots, without changing the administrative nature of the current system; · the second package incorporated the elements of the first package but added several more, including market-based mechanisms (in the form of explicit provision for secondary trading across the EU). It also included several pro-competitive proposals, such as revision of the new entrant rule and making the criteria for granting priority for allocation of a slot for the following season (so-called grandfather rights) slightly stricter; · the third package comprised all elements of the second package, but took the market-based mechanism a step further by withdrawing 'grandfather' or 'historical' slots and having them auctioned. The Commission recommended that the second package be implemented as its benefits would be considerably higher than the costs incurred. For the 2012-25 period, the package was estimated to result in an average annual increase of 1.6 % (or 23.8 million) in the number of passengers carried, a net economic benefit of EUR 5.3 billion, as well as a significant increase in employment (up to 62 000 full-time jobs). LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 (2) TFEU. CONTENT: the main points of the proposal are as follows : 1) Introduction of the possibility for secondary trade in slots and increased competition · in order to encourage greater slot mobility, the proposal expressly allows airlines to buy and sell slots ; · it is also proposed to broaden the definition of 'new entrant', to help facilitate the growth of sustainable competitors and reduce the schedule fragmentation that occurs when slots are allocated to a larger number of airlines unable to translate these slots into a viable alternative to dominant carriers. 2) Strengthening the transparency of the slot allocation process and the independence of slot coordinators: the proposal: · contains a number of provisions to ensure that the slot allocation process is supported by a sufficient degree of transparency; · will allow stricter criteria for the independence of the coordinators with regard to any interested party to be defined; · advocates enhanced cooperation between the coordinators, initially through the development of common projects covering, for instance, the development of common slot allocation software or even merging the coordination activities for airports situated in different Member States. On the basis of progress made, the Commission could eventually propose, at a later stage, the creation of a European coordinator responsible for slot allocation at all European Union airports. 3) Integration of slot allocation with the reform of the European air traffic management system (Single European Sky): the proposal aims to make an important contribution to strengthening the management of the aviation network at European level by associating the European Network Manager with the slot allocation process: · the Commission may request a capacity analysis at an airport, should the network manager deem this necessary for ensuring coherence with the airport operational plan. Such capacity analyses would be carried out in accordance with standards agreed at European level; · the Commission could make recommendations to the Member State on the capacity assessment if the network manager suggests that it does not fully take into account the needs of the European network; · the proposal also introduces a new category of airport: the 'network airport'. Such airports are not coordinated, but are identified as important since they may offer alternatives during times of network disruption. Thus, the proposal provides that coordinators gather information on the operations at these airports. 4) Amendment of the '80-20' rule and definition of a series of slots and resort to the airport charge system to discourage the late return of slots to the pool: · in order for airlines to be granted priority for the allocation of a given slot in the next corresponding scheduling season, they need to have used at least 85 % of the allocated series of slots (instead of 80 % at present); · the minimum series length (i.e. the minimum number of weekly slots required for priority allocation for the following corresponding season) is raised from 5 to 15 for the summer season and 10 for the winter season. Exceptions are provided for certain types of traffic (charter) to take the characteristics of regional airports into account; · lastly, to ensure that slots reserved prior to the start of an operating season are in fact operated as planned by airlines, the proposal would authorise airports to use an airport charge system to dissuade air carriers from belatedly returning slots to the pool. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a large number of EU citizens are exposed to high noise levels which may lead to negative health effects. An active noise management strategy is therefore necessary to mitigate the undesired effects. Such noise strategy must, however, carefully balance the interests of the affected citizens with other interests and take due account of the knock-on effects on the capacity of the whole aviation network. The process leading to a decision on noise-related operating restrictions should be consistent, evidence-based and robust to be acceptable for all stakeholders. In an effort to ensure a consistent approach to the application of noise abatement measures at airports, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) adopted a set of principles and guidance constituting the so-called ""Balanced Approach"" on noise management, which encourages ICAO Contracting States: to mitigate aviation noise through selection of the optimum local combination from a range of measures i) reducing noise at source (from use of quieter aircraft), ii) making best use of land (plan and manage the land surrounding airports; iii) introducing operational noise abatement procedures (by using specific runways, routes or procedures); and iv) imposing noise-related operating restrictions (such as a night ban or phasing out of noisier aircraft); to select the most cost-effective range of measures; not to introduce noise-related operating restrictions, unless the authority is in a position, on basis of studies and consultations, to determine whether a noise problem exists and having determined that an operating restriction is a cost-effective way of dealing with the problem. At ICAO level the EU actively supports the development of new noise standards for aircraft and invests in new technologies through Framework Programmes and the Clean Sky project. But land use planning, together with the associated insulation and compensation programmes, is a national or local competence. This proposed regulation aims to apply noise-related operating restrictions of the Balanced Approach in the EU in a consistent manner by clarifying the different steps of the decision-making process when considering operating restrictions. Consistent application of the approach should identify the most cost-effective solutions, tailor made to the specific airport situation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions in a consistent manner on an airport-by-airport basis so as to help improve the noise climate and to limit or reduce the number of people significantly affected by the harmful effects of aircraft noise, in accordance with the Balanced Approach. to facilitate the achievement of specific environmental noise abatement objectives, as laid down in Union, national and local rules, and to assess their interdependence with other environmental objectives, at the level of individual airports; to enable selection of the most cost-effective noise mitigation measures in accordance with the Balanced Approach so as to achieve the sustainable development of the airport and air traffic management network capacity from a gate-to-gate perspective. This Regulation shall apply to aircraft engaged in civil aviation. It shall not apply to aircraft engaged in military, customs, police, or similar services. The proposal introduces a new regulation to replace Directive 2002/30/EC. It clarifies and completes the requirements of that directive in relation to the following points: specification of objectives to stress link with other elements of the Balanced Approach and other instruments to manage air traffic noise. definition of allocation of responsibilities. listing of general requirements to manage noise. provision of more details on the noise assessment process. specification of stakeholders to be consulted. harmonisation of data and methods. specification of notification and introduction requirements. allowing comitology to adapt reference to noise standards to new technological progress. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he current Community Statistical Programme, adopted by a European Parliament and Council Decision No 1578/2007/EC and covering the period from 2008 to 2012, is the seventh of its kind. In recent years the European Statistical System has been faced with a number of challenges. (1) the need for European statistics has been constantly increasing, and this trend is unlikely to change in future. (2) the nature of statistics has changed — evidence-based decision making requires statistics that meet high quality criteria linked to the specific purposes they are serving, and there is an increasing need for complex multidimensional statistics supporting composite policy areas. (3) due to the appearance of new actors on the information market, including those providing information in nearly real time, the priority for the ESS in future is high quality and, in the case of short-term statistics, timeliness in particular. (4) budget constraints at both national and European level as well as the need to further reduce the burden on enterprises and citizens make the situation even more challenging. The Commission Communication on the production method of EU statistics: a vision for the next decade and the ESS strategy for its implementation15 address all these challenges by aiming to reengineer the ways of working in the ESS in order to make it more efficient and flexible. The implementation of this Communication constitutes the core of the proposed European statistical programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: prior to the preparation of this proposal, the users of European statistics, i.e. the Directorates-General of the Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, were consulted. In the framework of the impact assessment, after thorough consideration and analysis of the different scenarios, the number of options has been reduced to three: Option 1: ""zero option"" with no European Statistical Programme : the risks related to this option are high because in this case no legal framework for the production of European statistics would exist, so that their quality and the efficiency of statistical production would not be ensured. In these cases statistics would be produced in an uncoordinated way by different producers. Option 2: ESP 2013-17 will be a repetition of the CSP 2008-2012 : the risks involved in this option are linked to the fact that statistics provided would correspond to partially outdated policy priorities which are produced according to the traditional method, i.e. without taking advantage of the new method of production of European statistics aiming at efficiency gains and quality improvements. The costs of inadequate statistics would be considerable. Option 3: a new five-year European Statistical Programme is established : the risks linked to this option are considered to be relatively low as in this case European statistics would be produced under the established legal framework, i.e. the quality of statistics and the efficiency of the production method would be ensured as European statistics would be developed, collected and disseminated in a coordinated way. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes the European statistical programme for the period from 2013 to 2017. The programme provides the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, the main fields and the objectives of the actions envisaged for the programming period. The main purpose of European statistics is to underpin the development, monitoring and evaluation of European policies with reliable, objective, comparable and coherent factual information. The current proposal is consistent with the Union’s priorities as statistics developed, produced and disseminated under this programme will contribute to the implementation of the EU’s priority policies, such as the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and other policies addressed in the Commission’s strategic priorities for 2010-2014 (i.e. strengthened and integrated economic governance, climate change, growth and social cohesion, people’s Europe and globalisation). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: total amount to be borne by the budget of the EU is €299.4 million (current prices) for the duration of the programme from 2013 to 2017, of which €57.3 million is covered by the programming period 2007 to 2013 and €242.1 million by the programming period 2014 to 2017."

CONTENT: Directive 1999/45/EC contains a provision with regard to which such a delegation of power would be opportune. It is therefore appropriate to transform the codification of Directive 1999/45/EC into a recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendments. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of determining exemptions to certain provisions on environmental labelling, deciding on measures in the framework of the special provisions on the labelling of certain preparations and adapting the Annexes to technical progress.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: through Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies, which entered into full application on 7 December 2010, credit rating agencies (CRAs) are required to comply with rigorous rules of conduct in order to mitigate possible conflicts of interest, ensure high quality and sufficient transparency of ratings and the rating process. An amendment to Regulation (EU) No 513/2011 entrusted the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with exclusive supervisory powers over the registration and supervision of CRAs. Whilst providing a good basis, a number of issues related to credit rating activities and the use of ratings have not been sufficiently addressed in the existing CRA Regulation. These relate notably to: (i) the risk of overreliance on credit ratings by financial market participants, (ii) the high degree of concentration in the rating market, (iii) civil liability of credit rating agencies vis-à-vis investors, (iv) conflicts of interests with regard to the issuer-pays model and CRAs' shareholder structure. The specifics of sovereign ratings which became evident during the current sovereign debt crisis are also not specifically addressed in the current CRA Regulation. The Commission pointed to these open issues in its Communication of 2 June 2010 entitled ""Regulating financial services for sustainable growth"". On 8 June 2011, the European Parliament adopted a non-legislative resolution supporting the need to enhance the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies. The European Council of 23 October 2011 concluded that progress is needed on reducing overreliance on credit ratings. At the international level , in October 2010 the Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued principles to reduce authorities’ and financial institutions’ reliance on CRA ratings. Those principles were endorsed by the G20 Seoul Summit in November 2010. Lastly, the Commission recently addressed the question of overreliance on ratings by financial institutions in the context of the reform of the banking legislation. It proposed a similar provision in the draft amendment to the Directives on UCITS and on managers of alternative investment funds, which are presented in parallel to this proposal for a Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : different policy options were considered in order to address the problems identified and thus reach the corresponding specific objectives: · to diminish the impact of ""cliff"" effects on financial institutions and markets by reducing reliance on external ratings; · to mitigate the risks of contagion effects linked to sovereign ratings changes; · to improve credit rating market conditions with a view to improving the quality of ratings; · to ensure a right of redress for investors who have suffered losses due to a credit rating issued by a CRA that has infringed the CRA Regulation; and · to improve the quality of ratings by reinforcing the independence of CRAs and promoting sound credit rating processes and methodologies. Amongst the preferred policy options are the following: (i) reduction of overreliance by financial institutions on external ratings by reducing the importance of external ratings in financial services legislation; (ii) issuers' disclosure regarding the underlying asset pools of structured finance products to help investors to make their own credit risk assessment; (iii) quality of sovereign ratings to be improved through verification of underlying information and publication of the full research report accompanying the rating; (iv) comparison of ratings from distinct rating agencies, facilitated by promoting common standards for rating scales and a European Rating Index (EURIX), to improve choice; (v) mandatory rotation of CRAs; (vi) setting up a right of redress for investors against CRAs; (vii) strengthening the rules on the disclosure of rating methodologies. Lastly, there would be additional costs for financial firms resulting from the requirements to enhance internal risk management and the use of internal rating models for regulatory purposes and for issuers due to enhanced disclosure requirements. CRAs will also incur additional recurring compliance costs to mitigate risks of contagion effects linked to sovereign ratings. Neither the measures to improve competition nor the preferred options dealing with CRA independence would entail any significant costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation No 1060/2009 on credit ratings agencies. 1) Use of credit ratings: the proposal requires certain financial institutions to make their own credit risk assessment. They should therefore avoid relying solely or mechanistically on external credit ratings for assessing the creditworthiness of assets. Furthermore, ESMA, EBA and EIOPA should not refer to credit ratings in their guidelines, recommendations and draft technical standards where such references have the potential to trigger mechanistic reliance on credit ratings by competent authorities or financial market participants. · Issuers are obliged to disclose specific information on structured finance products on a continuing basis, in particular on the main elements of underlying asset pools for structured finance products necessary for investors to make their own credit assessment and thus avoid the need to rely on external ratings. This information is to be disclosed through a centralised website operated by ESMA. · Issuers (or their related third parties) who solicit a rating must engage two credit rating agencies, independent from each other, to issue two independent credit ratings in parallel on the same structured finance instruments. 2) Independence of credit ratings agencies : this group of amendments establishes stricter rules on independence which aim to address conflicts of interests with regard to the issuer-pays model and CRAs' shareholder structure: · The proposal prevents any member or shareholder of a CRA that holds a participation of at least 5% to hold 5% or more in any other CRA, unless the CRAs in question are members of the same group; · A new article introduces a rotation rule for the CRAs engaged by the issuer to either rate the issuer itself or its debt instruments. The CRA engaged should not be in place for more than 3 years or for more than 1 year if it rates more than ten consecutively rated debt instruments of the issuer. This rotation rule is expected significantly to mitigate the potential conflicts of interest issues relating to the issuer-pays model. Moreover, the Commission will continue to monitor the appropriateness of credit rating agencies' remuneration models and will submit a report thereon to the European Parliament and the Council by 7 December 2012. 3) Disclosure of information on methodologies of CRAs, credit ratings and rating outlooks: this group of amendments strengthens the rules on the disclosure of rating methodologies, with a view to promoting sound credit rating processes and, in fine, improve rating quality. · New provisions lay down procedures for the preparation of new rating methodologies or the modification of existing ones. They require the consultation of stakeholders on the new methodologies or the proposed changes and on their justification. Furthermore CRAs should submit the proposed methodologies to ESMA for the assessment of their compliance with existing requirements. · Each CRA will be obliged to correct errors in its methodologies or in their application, as well as to inform ESMA, the rated entities and generally the public of such errors. 4) Sovereign ratings: rules applying specifically to sovereign ratings (the rating of a State, a regional or local authority of a State or of an instrument for which the issuer of the debt or financial obligation is a State or a regional or local authority of a State) are particularly reinforced: · CRAs are required to assess sovereign ratings more frequently (every six months instead of every twelve months); · CRAs must publish a full research report when issuing and amending sovereign ratings, in order to improve transparency and enhance users’ understanding. Sovereign ratings should only be published after the close of business and at least one hour before the opening of trading venues in the EU; · CRAs must be transparent as to the allocation of staff to the ratings of different asset classes (i.e. corporate, structured finance, sovereign ratings). 5) Comparability of credit ratings: these amendments promote the comparability of credit ratings and provide for more transparency on fees charged for credit ratings. · CRAs must communicate their ratings to ESMA, which would ensure that all available ratings for a debt instrument are published in the form of a European Rating Index (EURIX), freely available to investors; · ESMA is empowered to develop draft technical standards, for endorsement by the Commission, on a harmonised rating scale to be used by CRAs. All ratings would need to follow the same scale standards, ensuring that investors can compare ratings more easily. · fees charged by CRAs to their clients for the provision of ratings (and ancillary services) should be non-discriminatory (i.e. based on actual cost and the transparency pricing criteria) and not based on any form of contingency (i.e. not depend on the result or outcome of the work performed). · CRAs must annually disclose to ESMA a list of fees charged to each client, for individual ratings and any ancillary service. · ESMA must undertake some monitoring activities regarding market concentration and the Commission will prepare a report on this issue. 6) Civil liability of credit rating agencies vis-à-vis investors: CRAs will bear such liability where they infringe, intentionally or with gross negligence, the CRA Regulation, thereby causing damage to an investor having relied on a credit rating of such CRA, provided the infringement in question affected the credit rating. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no impact on the European Union budget. In particular, tasks that would be entrusted to ESMA would not entail additional EU funding. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

It requires credit rating agencies (CRAs) to comply with rigorous rules of conduct in order to mitigate possible conflicts of interest, ensure high quality and sufficient transparency of ratings and the rating process. The Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) No 513/2011 which entrusted the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with exclusive supervisory powers over CRAs registered in the EU in order to centralise and simplify their registration and supervision at European level. However, a number of issues related to credit rating activities and the use of ratings have not been sufficiently addressed in the existing CRA Regulation. One of these issues is the risk of overreliance on credit ratings by financial market participants, including UCITS and AIFS who do not necessarily conducting their own assessments of the creditworthiness of issuers of such debt instruments. The European Commission pointed to these open issues in its Communication of 2 June 2010 on Regulating financial services for sustainable growth, and announced the need for a targeted review of the CRA Regulation. On 8 June 2011, the European Parliament adopted a non-legislative resolution on CRAs, which supports the need to enhance the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies and to take measures to reduce the risk of over-reliance of ratings.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment has been produced for this proposal. It can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/agencies/index_en.htm. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53 (1) TFEU. CONTENT: in order to reduce the risk of over-reliance of managers of UCITS and AIFs on credit ratings, the Commission proposes to introduce amendments to Directive 2009/65/EC on the coordination of law, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers. The Commission is presenting in parallel a proposal of Regulation for the amendment of the CRA Regulation. Amendment of Directive 2009/65/EC on UCITS : the proposal amends Article 51 of Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the risk management process: §  it introduces a requirement for the management or investment company not to solely or mechanistically rely on external credit ratings for assessing the creditworthiness of the UCITS assets. External credit ratings may be used as one factor among others in this process but shall not prevail; §  it proposes corresponding amendments to the existing powers of the Commission to adopt delegated acts with a view to specifying the provisions of Article 51(1) of 2009/65/EC. Amendment of Directive 2011/61/EC on managers of AIFs: the proposal amends Article 15 of Directive 2011/61/EU as regards the risk management systems: §  it introduces a requirement for the AIF Manager not to solely or mechanistically rely on external credit ratings for assessing the creditworthiness of the AIF assets. External credit ratings may be used as one factor among others in this process but shall not prevail; §  it proposes corresponding amendments to the existing powers of the Commission to adopt delegated acts with a view to specifying the provisions of Article 15(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 of 18 September 2007 establishing a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks. This act was adopted prior to the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Powers conferred on the Commission : the main legal action is to identify the powers conferred upon the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 and to classify these as delegated or implementing powers. The core objective of the plan is to ensure that Baltic cod stocks can be exploited under sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. Science may evolve and improve, and the plan needs to contain the necessary provisions to ensure it is kept up to date with the best science available. Article 27 of the Regulation stipulates that if scientific advice indicates that that the fishing mortality rates are disaccording with the objectives of the plan, the Council must by qualified majority revise mortality rates as to ensure that the plan can attain its management objectives. The current text therefore confers the power to amend these non-essential elements of the plan on the Council. Such decision-making procedure is no longer possible under the TFEU. Similarly, Article 26 provides for modification by the Council of certain non-essential elements of the plan to ensure that the objectives are met. Article 290 of the TFEU provides that a legislative act may delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act. By way of consequence, the decision-making procedure in Article 26 and 27 of the Regulation should be converted into a system of delegated powers to be exercised by the Commission under the conditions set out in the plan itself. The plan should therefore be amended accordingly. Evaluation: the plan requires evaluation of the impact of the management measures on the stocks concerned and on the fisheries concerned. The timeline set in the Regulation in force is neither feasible nor efficient. This requirement means considerable difficulties due to the limited availability of relevant data to carry out appropriate assessment. Consequently, the timeline for evaluation of the plan should be modified. Furthermore, implementing powers should be given to the Commission to confirm whether the conditions established in Article 29 of the Regulation are fulfilled and, consequently whether relevant provisions apply in the subdivisions concerned. Maximum sustainable yield : the Commission and Member States signed up to the aim of achieving a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for depleted stocks by 2015 at the latest, but it is not indicated as objective of the plan. To avoid any ambiguities in the plan the reference to the maximum sustainable yield should be included in the plan. The Regulation is amended accordingly to clarify that the procedure at issue is that provided for by the Treaty. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: in view of the new amendments which have become necessary and following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it is necessary to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 and replace it with a new text. 1. Alignment with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) : the harmonisation of Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 with the new rules contained in the Treaty is based on classifying into delegated powers (Article 290 of the TFEU) and implementing powers (Article 291 of the TFEU) of the provisions adopted by the Commission pursuant to that Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1914/2006 laying down certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006). Following this exercise, a draft proposal recasting Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 has been drafted. Under this draft, the Legislator reserves the right to issue decisions concerning the essential elements of a specific scheme for certain agricultural products in the smaller Aegean islands, in order to remedy the difficulties caused by their isolation, remoteness, insularity, small size, mountainous terrain and climate and their economic dependency on a small number of products. The general guidelines for this scheme and the general principles which underpin it are determined by the Legislator. As such, the objectives of the measures introduced by this specific scheme and the principles regarding programming, compatibility and consistency with other EU policies are defined by the Legislator. The Legislator also establishes the principles for a certification scheme and the application of penalties, reductions and exclusions. - In accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU: the Commission may adopt, by means of a delegated act, the conditions for operators being registered in the register of certificates and can, if necessary (given the economic situation), require the lodging of a security for the issuing of certificates. The Legislator can also delegate to the Commission the power to adopt measures relating to the establishment of the procedure for approving amendments to the programme, conditions for processing, the conditions on establishing aid amounts and penalties. - In accordance with Article 291 of the TFEU: the Legislator may grant the Commission the power to implement, specifically with regard to the uniform conditions relating to the introduction of the system of certificates and the commitment of operators concerning the specific supply arrangements, the uniform conditions for implementing the programme and a general framework of checks which Greece must perform. 2. Substantive amendments : in view of the fact that since it was adopted, Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 has been the subject of several amendments, it is proposed that it be recast in the interests of clarity. Furthermore, changes in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation that have occurred since it was adopted also make it necessary to amend certain of its provisions and to restructure the legislative text so that it reflects more effectively the reality of this scheme. This new regulation is more explicit in setting out the scheme’s main objectives, the implementation of which the specific measures for agriculture in the smaller Aegean islands should contribute to. Its new structure highlights the central role played by the support programme, which has now been defined for the smaller Aegean islands at the most appropriate level and coordinated by Greece. This programme relates to the two fundamental elements of the specific supply arrangement and of the specific measures to assist local production. Other minor amendments have been made to the wording of the Regulation, in particular: · the procedure for submitting the programme and amendments for approval to the Commission has been specified to make it more consistent with current practice and in view of the need for greater flexibility and efficiency as regards the process of adapting the programme to meet the actual needs of agriculture and the supply of products essential for the smaller Aegean islands; · it has been specified that the specific supply arrangements should be designed in accordance with local agricultural production, the development of which should not be limited by aid for supply which is too excessive for products which are also produced locally; · in the interests of sound budgetary management, Greece must indicate in its programme the list of aid constituting direct payments; · it is also helpful to indicate how the aid amounts for measures to assist local agricultural products are defined, which was previously not indicated in the basic act; · the ceiling for financing for the specific supply arrangements has increased by 20%, in the light of the information provided by the Court of Auditors concerning the insufficiency of these funds; · the date for presenting the annual report on the implementation of the measures under the support programme during the previous year was postponed for a month in order to provide the Greek authorities with the opportunity of taking account in the report of the final statement of expenditure for the measures to assist local agricultural production. The Regulation does not affect the sources of financing or the intensity of Community support. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: although the proposed amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 do not modify the maximum annual amount, the maximum amount of the special supply arrangements changes to EUR 6.56 million, which will lead to a different resource allocation. This, in turn, could have an impact on the rate of expenditure. However, this possible impact is not measurable at this stage."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: in view of the fact that since it was adopted on 30 January 2006, Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been the subject of several amendments, it is proposed that it be recast in the interests of clarity. Furthermore, changes in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation that have occurred since it was adopted, make it necessary to modify certain provisions and to restructure the legislative text so that it reflects more effectively the reality of the POSEI agricultural scheme. The main amendments are as follows: Subject: the Regulation lays down specific measures for agriculture to mitigate the difficulties caused by extreme remoteness, specifically remoteness, isolation, small surface areas, terrain, difficult climate and economic dependence on a limited number of products of the outermost regions. Objectives: the proposal is more explicit in setting out the scheme’s main objectives: The specific measures shall help to meet the following objectives: guaranteed supply to the outermost regions of products essential for human consumption or for processing and as agricultural inputs by mitigating the additional costs due to extreme remoteness; preservation and development of agricultural activities in the outermost regions, including the production, processing and the sale of local products. These objectives shall be implemented by means of the measures referred to in Chapters III, IV and V. Structure: the new structure highlights the central role played by the Programmes of Options Specifically Relating to the Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI programmes) which have now been defined for each outermost region at the most appropriate level and coordinated by the relevant Member States. These programmes relate to the two fundamental POSEI elements, namely the specific supply arrangements and the specific measures in favour of local production. POSEI : the measures provided for are defined for each outermost region by a POSEI Programme which shall comprise: a) specific supply arrangements and b) specific measures to assist local agricultural production. The POSEI programme shall be established at the geographical level which the Member State concerned deems most appropriate. It shall be prepared by the competent authorities designated by the said Member State, which shall submit it to the Commission for approval after the competent authorities and organisations at the appropriate regional level have been consulted. A single POSEI programme may be submitted for each Member State in respect of its outermost regions. Other amendments : minor amendments have been made to the wording of the Regulation, in particular: the procedure for submitting programmes and amendments for approval to the Commission has been specified to make it more consistent with current practice and in view of the need for greater flexibility and efficiency as regards the process of adapting programmes to meet the actual needs of agriculture and the supply of products essential for the outermost regions; it has been specified that the specific supply arrangements should be designed for each region in accordance with local agricultural production, the development of which should not be limited by aid for supply which is too excessive for products which are also produced locally. This provision is considered to be necessary to make it compulsory for the two POSEI instruments to be compatible with each other; the possibility of re-dispatching products which have been processed locally using basic products which have benefited from the specific supply arrangements, without the benefit being reimbursed, which was restricted to products dispatched from the Azores to Madeira or vice versa, or from Madeira to the Canary Islands or vice versa, will also now apply to the French overseas departments; in the interests of sound budgetary management, Member States must indicate in their programmes the list of aid constituting direct payments; it is also helpful to indicate how the aid amounts for measures to assist local agricultural products are defined, which was previously not indicated in the basic act; lastly, the financial allocation for each national programme selected is that which corresponds to the 2011 financial year and subsequent years. However, the ceiling for financing for the specific supply arrangements for France and Portugal has increased by 20%, in the light of the conclusions of the first report on the impact of the 2006 POSEI reform, submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in 2010. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not affect the sources of financing or the “intensity of Community support.”"

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 89/105/EEC relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems was adopted so as to remove distortions to intra-Community trade in medicinal products. Directive 89/105/EEC has never been amended since its adoption. Its provisions reflect the pharmaceutical market conditions which prevailed more than twenty years ago. However, these conditions have fundamentally changed, for instance with the emergence of generic medicines providing cheaper versions of existing products or the development of increasingly innovative (yet often expensive) research-based medicinal products. In parallel, the constant rise in public expenditure on pharmaceuticals in the last decades has encouraged Member States to devise more complex and innovative pricing and reimbursement systems over time. Despite the historically positive impact of Directive 89/105/EEC on the internal market for medicines, there is evidence that it does not fully achieve its objectives in the present context: (1) A gap has emerged between the provisions of the Directive, which describe the main types of pricing and reimbursement procedures established in the 1980s, and the much wider range of cost-containment measures adopted nowadays by Member States. Despite the extensive interpretation of the Directive by the Court of Justice, the implementation of its provisions in national law and the effective enforcement of its principles, in particular by the Commission, have become particularly challenging. This situation not only results in legal uncertainties but also in a reduced transparency of national pricing and reimbursement measures, which negatively affects the smooth functioning of the internal market to the detriment of European patients and pharmaceutical companies. (2) The time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions established by Directive 89/105/EEC are regularly exceeded by Member States. This leads to delays in the marketing of medicinal products, which in turn slows down the availability of valuable treatments for patients. In order to take into account the evolution of the pharmaceutical market and of national policies to control public expenditure on medicines, substantive changes are necessary to all major provisions of Directive 89/105/EEC. Therefore, in the interest of clarity, Directive 89/105/EEC should be replaced. The fundamental objectives and principles of Directive 89/105/EEC remain fully valid in the present context. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal to revise the Directive is based on the combination of options recommended in the framework of the impact assessment, namely: to ensure timely pricing and reimbursement decisions : options A.3/c (regular reports on pricing and reimbursement approval times), A.4/a (shorter time-limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions concerning generic medicinal products) and A.4/b (prohibition of patent linkage and re-assessment of safety features); to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Directive in the current context : options B.3/b (extensive revision of the Directive to clarify its scope and wording) and B.4 (notification of draft national measures to facilitate enforcement). The possible extension of the Directive to include medical devices was examined in the impact assessment but discarded due to the specificities of this market. Furthermore, in spite of the difficulty to conclude on the overall cost-benefit balance of reducing the time limits with respect to originator medicines, a reduction from the current 90/180 days to 60/120 days is proposed in light of the positive impact it would have on the swift availability of innovative medicines to patients and on rewarding pharmaceutical innovation when medicines are approved for reimbursement. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he overall objective of the proposal is to clarify the procedural obligations incumbent upon Member State and to ensure the effectiveness of the Directive, both in avoiding delays in pricing and reimbursement decisions and in preventing barriers to pharmaceutical trade. This shall be done without affecting national social security policies, except as far as it is necessary to achieve the transparency of national procedures and the effectiveness of the internal market legislation. The proposal maintains the core principles of the existing Directive but also puts forward a comprehensive adaptation of its legal provisions based on the following key elements: Clarification of the scope of the Directive : the transparency requirements apply to all pricing and reimbursement measures understood in a broad sense, including “demand side” measures to control or promote the prescription of specific medicines. Nevertheless, measures involving public procurement and voluntary contractual agreements with individual companies are excluded from the scope of the Directive in order to avoid interference with other bodies of law. Comprehensive coverage of national measures and legal clarity : the provisions of the Directive are reworded in accordance with general principles (rather than on the basis of specific national procedures) and incorporate the case-law of the Court of Justice. Several key provisions are clarified and updated to avoid interpretation controversies. In particular, it is made clear that the time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions include all procedural steps leading to the decision, including health technology assessments where applicable. Adaptation of the time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions : the time limits applicable to generic medicines are reduced to 15/30 days when the reference product has already been priced and included in the health insurance system. The time limits applicable to all other medicinal products are reduced to 60/120 days. However, in cases where national authorities subject medicinal products to health technology assessment procedures in order to assess the relative efficacy or the short- and long-term effectiveness, as an integral part of their decision-making process, the time-limits shall be 90/180 days. Non-interference of patent and safety issues with pricing and reimbursement procedures : the proposal clarifies that intellectual property rights should not interfere with pricing and reimbursement procedures, as is already the case for marketing authorisation procedures. In addition, elements already assessed in the framework of the marketing authorisation process (quality, safety and efficacy, including bioequivalence) may not be reassessed in the framework of pricing and reimbursement procedures. Dialogue and enforcement tools : different instruments are put in place to facilitate dialogue on the implementation of the Directive and to ensure its effective enforcement (consultation on draft measures at national level and pre-notification to the Commission, the creation of a remedies procedure in case of non-compliance with the time-limits related to the inclusion of medicinal products in health insurance systems). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the C ommission's proposal has no impact on the European Union budget beyond what is already foreseen for the years to come in the Multiannual Financial Framework. Total appropriations under headings 1 to 5 of the multiannual financial framework are estimated at EUR 0.859 million (2014); EUR 1.293 million (2015); EUR 1.143 million (2016-2017); EUR 1.093 (2018 action continued)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Green Paper on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy concluded that despite progress since the 2002 reform, the objectives to achieve sustainable fisheries in all its dimensions (environmental, economic and social) have not been met. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers supported this conclusion. The main problems of the CFP are: lack of focus in the objectives on environmental, economic and social sustainability; unacceptably high levels of discards; fleet overcapacity, overfishing, total allowable catches (TACs) that are set too high, and low compliance have resulted in a large majority of Union stocks being overexploited; low profitability and low economic resilience for a significant number of fleets; insufficient integration of environmental concerns into the policy; lack of reliable data to assess all stocks and fleets; substantial public financial support to fisheries that does not contribute to achieving the objectives of the CFP; low attractiveness of the fishing activities and decline of some coastal communities dependent on fishing; top-down micro-management at Union level, lacking flexibility and adaptation to local and regional conditions; insufficient development of aquaculture in the Union; legislation and management are costly and extremely complex, which fosters lack of compliance; trade policy facing the challenge of globalisation and increased interdependence. The Common Fisheries Policy needs a fundamental reform by repealing the current Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy, and replacing it on 1 January 2013 by a new CFP adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: for the Impact Assessment exercise different options for the CFP reform package were identified. Two preferred options are similar in focusing on the environmental sustainability while creating sufficient flexibility to give the fishing sector time to adapt to ambitious environmental objectives. The impact assessment demonstrates that ambitious targets for the resources meeting the Union's international obligation of achieving maximum sustainable yield by 2015 can deliver important overall stock improvement leading to significant economic and social improvements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The Commission introduces in the proposal significant changes to the CFP. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: General Provisions : the overall objective of the CFP is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities provide long-term sustainable environmental conditions, which are a prerequisite to reach an economically and socially sustainable fishing industry that contributes to the availability of food. The policy shall be aimed at exploitation of living marine biological resources that restores and maintains fish resources at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, not later than 2015. The CFP shall implement the precautionary and ecosystem approaches to fisheries management. Access to waters :the proposal confirms the principle of equal access to waters, while treating third-country vessels with access to Union waters equally. The Commission proposes to extend the current restrictions on the right to fish within the 12- nautical miles until 2022. These restrictions have reduced fishing pressure in the most biologically sensitive areas and have contributed to economic stability for small-scale, coastal fishing activities. The Commission proposes to introduce into this regulation the specific restrictions for the 100 nautical miles around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Conservation of marine biological resources : conservation of marine biological resources is the fundamental pillar to achieve the objectives of the CFP. The proposal covers the main principles for technical conservation measures applicable to fisheries. For the multi-annual plans and the technical conservation measures the Commission envisages a move away from micro-management by the co-legislators. The Union legislation on these plans and measures needs to define the essentials, such as the scope, targets, evaluation indicators and time frames. The Commission proposes decentralization that may authorize Member States to adopt the conservation and technical measures necessary to achieve the objectives and targets using a toolbox of measures under the conservation policy. This will create regional flexibility and simplification of the policy. Access to resources : the proposal introduces a mandatory system of transferable fishing concessions (on fishing opportunities for regulated stocks) as from 2014 for all vessels with the exception of vessels under 12 meters with passive gear. Management of fishing capacity : the general obligation for Member States to adjust the fleet capacity to the fishing opportunities is maintained. For the period when decommissioning of vessels with public aid remains possible under the European Fisheries Fund, the provisions on fleet capacity reductions have to remain in place. The Member State and Commission fleet registers will ensure informed monitoring and management of the fleets. Science base for fisheries management : the proposal introduces provisions for Member States to adopt national fisheries data collection and scientific and innovation programs and to coordinate between themselves, in particular with a view to the Union research and innovation framework. External policy : the external policy is integrated into the CFP to ensure alignment of its objectives with the overall principles and objectives of the CFP. The Union shall actively participate in the works of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), as well as international multilateral bodies (UN, FAO) in order to strengthen them and enhance their performance in the management and conservation of international fish stocks. Relations with third countries through Sustainable Fisheries Agreements (SFAs) are another means to promote internationally the CFP principles and objectives. Aquaculture : the CFP should support the environmentally, economically and socially sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. The Commission considers that the specific nature of aquaculture requires a focalized stakeholder consultation body, and proposes to this effect the creation of an Advisory Council for Aquaculture. Common Market Organisation : the organisation of the common markets needs to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, to enable the industry to apply the CFP at the appropriate level, and to strengthen competitiveness, particularly of producers. Control and Enforcement : c onsistent with the new control regime as adopted with Council Regulations No 1005/2008 and No 1224/2009, the proposal integrates the basic elements for the Union control and enforcement regime for compliance with the rules of the CFP. The Commission proposes monitoring and control obligations in particular in relation to fully documented fishery, as well as pilot projects on new fisheries control technologies that contribute to sustainable fishing. Financial Instruments : to increase compliance the proposal introduces conditions for Union financial assistance that may be granted to contribute to the achievement of the CFP objectives. Financial assistance will become conditional upon compliance with the rules, and this principle will apply to both Member States and operators. For Member States non-compliance may result in interruption, suspension or financial correction to the Union financial assistance. For operators serious, infringements may lead to banning of access to financial assistance or financial reductions. Advisory Councils : the Commission proposes to consolidate and where possible to extend the experience with the Regional Advisory Councils under the CFP. The proposal should provide for regionalisation of measures on a sea-basin approach under the conservation pillar. In conjunction with this proposal the Commission will adopt a proposal for a Regulation on the common organisation of the markets in fisheries and aquaculture products. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the impact is estimated at € 69.754 million for operational expenditure in commitment appropriations for the year 2013. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 70/157/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles harmonised the different technical requirements of Member States relating to the permissible sound level of motor vehicles and of their exhaust systems for the purpose of the establishment and operation of the internal market. For the purposes of the good functioning of the internal market and in order to ensure a uniform and consistent application throughout the Union, it is appropriate to replace that Directive by a Regulation. As more information about the health impacts of noise became available, the need for a higher level of protection of EU citizens through further EU-wide measures became more imminent. The European Commission Green Paper on Noise from 1996 estimated that around 20% of the then EU population suffered from noise levels that scientists and health experts consider to be unacceptable. Based on information from EU Member States, the European Environment Agency has estimated, that half of the population in urban areas is exposed to noise levels above 55 dB(A) as a result of ambient road noise. Over the years, considerable research effort, including large EU-funded projects, has been dedicated to the quantitative assessment of the relationship between environmental noise and its effects. Although the approaches and the scope of the various studies differ, common ground can be found in the terms of harmful effects and annoyance that noise generates. These findings have been confirmed by the 2008 WHO-report. The Communication from the European Commission regarding a European strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles announced that the European Commission will present a proposal in 2011 to amend the respective legislation to reduce the noise emissions of vehicles. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: different options were considered for the proposal which covered environmental, social and economic aspects: Option 1 : No change - the current limit values together with the allowances will remain valid, as well as the old measurement method; Option 2 : New method - old limit values (the new measurement method will be combined with the current set of limit values); Option 3 : New method – new limit values equivalent to old ones; Option 4 : New method – new limit values with noise reduction potential; Option 5 : New method – new limit values with noise reductions potential in a two step approach. According to the most preferable option (Option 5) , the limit values for light and medium size vehicles will be lowered in two steps of each 2 dB(A) and for heavy vehicles in a first step of 1 and a second step of 2 dB(A). This will result in a reduction of the noise impact of about 3 dB(A) for free flowing traffic and up to 4 dB(A) for intermittent traffic. The reduction of the number of highly annoyed people will be 25 %. The cost-benefit ratio for this measure is estimated to be around 20 times in favour of the noise reduction compared to no action taken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft proposal will repeal Directive 70/157/EEC and its subsequent amendments. It aims to update the requirements for the type-approval system as regards the sound level of motor vehicles and of their exhaust systems. In particular, it introduces a new test method for noise emissions measurement, lowers noise limit values and introduces additional sound emission provisions in the EU type-approval procedure. A more ambitious final target for noise reduction shall be pursued. This would be achieved in two stages: the first step is a reduction of 2 dB(A) for light vehicles and 1 dB(A) for heavy vehicles and can be introduced two years after the date of publication of the present proposal; the second step is a reduction of 2 dB(A) for light vehicles and 2 dB(A) for heavy vehicles. It will require more development effort and a more drastic set of technical measures: according to the contractor, this step could be introduced two years after the first step. The total reduction would be 4 dB(A) for light vehicles and 3 dB(A) for heavy vehicles. The draft proposal will lay down new requirements: new test protocol, new limit values, additional sound emission provisions and minimum noise for electric and electric-hybrid vehicles. It is proposed to amend the noise legislation with an Annex harmonising the performance of 'Approaching Vehicle Audible Systems' if they are fitted to a vehicle. The fitting of such systems however shall be voluntary and remain an option under the discretion of the vehicle manufacturers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision No 573/2007/EC established the European Refugee Fund , Decision No 575/2007/EC established the European Return Fund and Council Decision 2007/435/EC established the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals , as part of the General programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’. These Funds provide for different Union co-financing rates for actions supported by the Funds. The unprecedented global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability, provoking a marked deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several Member States. Some Member States are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, particularly with respect to their financial and economic stability, leading to deterioration in their deficit and debt positions and threatening economic growth heightened by the international economic and financial environment. Ensuring the smooth implementation of programmes adopted under the four Funds established as part of the General Programme on ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ (‘the Funds’), is of particular importance as a means of injecting funds into the economy. To make European Union funding easier to manage in the area of migration, asylum and external borders and to improve the availability of funding for the Member States to implement their annual programmes under the Funds, it is necessary, on a temporary basis and without prejudice to the 2014-2020 programming period, to arrange for an increase in the Union co-financing rate under the Funds, by an amount corresponding to twenty percentage points above the co-financing rates currently applicable, for Member States experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal regarding a similar amendment of the External Borders Fund (please see COD/2012/0253 ). LEGAL BASIS: Articles 78(2) and Article 79(2) and (4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no consultation of external stakeholders. The proposal will allow the Commission to apply higher co-financing rates for the countries benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. CONTENT: in order to ensure that Member States benefiting from a financial support mechanism continue to implement the programmes adopted under the Funds on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the proposal contains provisions that would allow the Commission to increase the Union co-financing rate for these countries, for the period during which they benefit from financial assistance provided by one of the support mechanisms under any funding instruments. This will provide additional financial resources to the Member States and will make it easier to continue implementing the programmes on the ground. The Funds’ annual national allocation pursuant to the basic acts will remain unchanged while national co-financing will be reduced accordingly. Ongoing annual programmes will need to be revised to reflect the changes resulting from the application of the increased Union co-financing rate. The proposal makes provision for the following amendments: Amendment of Article 14 and Article 21(3) of Decision No 573/2007/EC: Article 14 currently provides that the Union co-financing rate for supported actions does not in principle exceed 50% (and that this Union co-financing rate may be increased to 75% if the Member State in question is covered by the Cohesion Fund). Under this proposal, it is proposed that the Union contribution could to be increased by 20 percentage points, if the Member State satisfies one of the following conditions at the time at which they submit their draft annual programme: i) Article 21(3) of Decision No 573/2007/EC provides that financial assistance from the European Refugee Fund for emergency measures shall not exceed 80% of the cost of each measure. The Commission proposes to allow the Union co-financing rate applicable to the European Refugee Fund programmes of the Member States concerned to be increased by 20 percentage points, provided they are benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. Amendment of Article 15 of Decision No 575/2007/EC establishing the European Return Fund and amendment of Article 13 of Council Decision 2007/435/EC establishing the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007 to 2013 have identical content to Article 14 of Decision No 573/2007/EC. The proposal contains a similar provision increasing the Union co-financing rate by 20 percentage points. Annual programme : once a decision granting financial assistance to a Member State under one of the support mechanisms has been taken, the Member State may submit to the Commission either a draft annual programme or a draft revised annual programme applying the increased Union co-financing rate. However, once an action of a specific annual programme has been co-financed at the increased Union co-financing rate, it remains so until the end of the eligibility period of the related annual programme whether or not the Member State still benefits from one of the support mechanisms. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modifications are proposed to the maximum amounts of the Funds' financing provided for in the annual programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. The proposal states that it shows the Commission's willingness to assist Member States in their efforts to deal with the financial crisis. The amendments will provide the Member States concerned with the necessary funds to support projects and economic recovery."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he TEN-E framework was developed and shaped in the 1990s through the successive TEN-E Guidelines and the corresponding financing Regulation. The report on the implementation of the TEN-E framework in the period 2007-2009 concluded that, while making a positive contribution to selected projects by giving them political visibility, the policy lacks focus, flexibility and a top-down approach to fill identified infrastructure gaps. In order to achieve the key objectives of its energy policy in terms of competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply, the Union as a matter of priority needs to modernise and expand its energy infrastructures and to interconnect networks across borders. Several challenges need to be addressed: electricity networks must be upgraded and modernised to meet increasing electricity demand due to a major shift in the overall energy value chain and mix; grids must also be urgently extended and upgraded, including through electricity highways, to foster market integration and maintain the existing levels of system's security, but especially to transport and balance electricity generated from renewable sources, which is expected to more than double in the period 2007-2020; the need for more innovation and intelligence in the networks at both transmission and distribution level, in particular through information and communication technologies; in the medium term, depleting indigenous conventional natural gas resources call for additional, diversified imports; given the role of oil in the energy mix of the coming decades, maintaining uninterrupted crude-oil supplies to land-locked EU countries in Central-Eastern Europe, currently dependent on limited supply routes, is of strategic importance; carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies would reduce carbon dioxide emissions on a large scale while allowing the use of fossil fuels, which will remain an important source for electricity generation over the next decades. The Commission, in its communication entitled “Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond” called for a new EU energy infrastructure policy to coordinate and optimise network development on a continental scale. It confirmed in particular the necessity to overhaul the existing trans-European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) policy and financing framework. In the report that it presented to the June 2011 Energy Council, the Commission estimated total investment needs in energy infrastructures of European importance up to 2020 at about EUR 200 billion. Investment volumes for the period from 2011 up to 2020 will increase by 30% for gas and up to 100% for electricity compared to current levels. The main identified obstacles, which will under business-as-usual assumptions prevent these investments from taking place or delay them far beyond the 2020 deadline, are problems related to permit granting (lengthy and ineffective permit granting procedures, along with public opposition), regulation (framework not geared towards delivering European infrastructure priorities) and financing (limited financing capacities of operators, lack of adapted funding instruments and sufficient support). BACKGROUND: after a first impact assessment, undertaken in 2010, the 2011 assessment, on the basis of the first, deals in greater detail with the policy options in the following areas: Permit granting and public consultation: The analysis compares three options: i) establishment of a regime of common interest; ii) definition of rules on the organisation and duration of the permit granting process, notably a ""full one-stop shop"" and a time limit; and iii) a combination of the two previous options. The overall impact of the last policy option is considered to be the most positive of all. Regulatory issues : the analysis compares three options: i) cross-border cost allocation; ii) investment incentives; and iii) a combination of the two previous options. The analysis shows that both an ex ante cross-border cost allocation mechanism and incentives commensurate with the risks incurred by the operator are necessary to ensure implementation of projects of common interest facing challenges with regard to their viability. Financing: four financing options were also examined: i) use of risk sharing instruments (including project bonds and guarantees); ii) use of risk capital instruments (including equity participations); iii) use of grant support for project studies and construction; and iv) a combination of grants, risk sharing and risk capital instruments. The overall impact of the last policy option was considered the most positive LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims at replacing the existing TEN-E Guidelines and will lead to the repeal of Decision 1364/2006/EC as of 1 January 2014. It seeks to lay down rules for the timely development and interoperability of trans-European energy networks in order to achieve the energy policy objectives of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to i) ensure the functioning of the internal energy market, ii) to ensure security of supply in the Union, iii) to promote energy efficiency and the development of new and renewable forms of energy, and iv) to promote the interconnection of energy networks. To this effect, this initiative identifies, for the period up to 2020 and beyond, a limited number of trans-European priority corridors and areas covering electricity and gas networks, as well as oil and carbon dioxide transport infrastructure, for which European Union action is most warranted. It then aims at implementing these priorities by: streamlining permit granting procedures to significantly reduce their duration for projects of common interest and increase public participation and acceptance for the implementation of such projects; facilitating the regulatory treatment of projects of common interest in electricity and gas by allocating costs depending on the benefits provided and ensuring allowed returns are in line with risks incurred; ensuring implementation of projects of common interest (PCIs) by providing necessary market-based and direct EU financial support. The main aspects of the proposal are as follows: Priority to 12 strategic trans-European energy infrastructure corridors and areas: the proposal establishes a selection process based on regional expert groups and an advisory role for the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) in electricity and gas, the final decision, to be updated every two years; the regional expert groups and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) are entrusted with the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of PCIs. The Commission may nominate European coordinators for PCIs facing difficulties. A regime of common interest for PCIs ,: this would give particular responsibilities to one national competent authority within each Member State to coordinate and oversee the permit granting process for PCIs, set minimum standards for transparency and public participation and fix the maximum allowed duration of the permit granting process; this clarifies that PCIs can be implemented under certain conditions for reasons of ""overriding public interest"", as defined in Directives 92/43/EC and 2000/60/EC; Member States are free to design their specific internal procedures in line with their national legal systems. Methodology and a process for the elaboration of a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis : on the basis of this methodology, it gives responsibility to national regulatory authorities and ACER to allocate costs across-border for PCIs in these sectors according to the benefits in the Member States directly or indirectly concerned by these PCIs; national regulatory authorities are also requested to grant appropriate incentives through tariffs for the implementation of PCIs facing higher risks for justified reasons. Eligibility of projects : the Regulation determines the conditions for eligibility of PCIs to Union financial assistance under the Connecting Europe Facility, for both studies (accessible to all PCIs except those in the oil sector) and works (accessible to all PCIs in the smart grids and carbon dioxide sector, and to PCIs in electricity and gas fulfilling certain conditions, notably having obtained a cross-border cost allocation decision). BUDGETARY IMPACT: all budgetary implications of this proposal are dealt with under the legislative financial statement of the Proposal for a Regulation establishing the Connecting Europe Facility. This mechanism, announced by the Commission in its Communication of 29 June 2011 ""A Budget for Europe 2020"" on the next multi-annual financial framework (2014-2020), is designed to finance the completion of priority energy, transport and digital infrastructures with a single fund of EUR 40 billion, of which EUR 9.1 billion would be dedicated to energy."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: appropriate land uses and management practices in forestry and agriculture can limit emissions of carbon and enhance removals from the atmosphere. Such practices are covered by the LULUCF sector, which comprises mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and removals by terrestrial ecosystems, generally estimated as carbon stock changes. Agriculture, forestry, related industries and energy are the most important economic sectors relevant for LULUCF and they can contribute to the reduction of emissions and enhancement of sinks in several ways. Although the LULUCF sector does not yet count towards the Union’s emission reduction target for 2020, it counts in part towards the Union’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC for the period from 2008 to 2012. However, the existing international accounting rules, which are a mix of voluntary and mandatory practices, have significant drawbacks. Most importantly, accounting is voluntary for most LULUCF activities, notably for forest management (representing about 70% of the sector) and for cropland and grazing-land management (representing about 17% of the sector). As a result, accounting in this first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol varies greatly between Member States. Another drawback is the lack of incentives for climate change mitigation in forestry. Improvements in accounting are necessary to create a level playing field within the agricultural, forestry and related industries and energy sectors in the Member States with a view to ensuring their consistent treatment within the Union’s internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment investigated three key issues that need to be addressed when assessing how LULUCF should be included in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments, namely how to: ensure robust accounting rules for emissions and removals; achieve robust monitoring and reporting; establish the appropriate policy context for bringing the sector into the Union’s climate change commitments. Based on the policy context for including the sector in the Union’s commitments currently regulated by the ESD and the EU ETS, the impact assessment considered three options for including LULUCF, namely as part of the ESD, as a separate framework or by delaying inclusion altogether. Each option addressed the issues of accounting and monitoring. The potential social, economic and environmental impacts of the various options were considered in detail. The impact assessment concluded that there were good reasons to include LULUCF in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission-reduction commitments, namely to improve their policy coherence, environmental integrity and economic efficiency. But this will only be possible if the right policy context for LULUCF is put in place. The high variability of emissions and removals in forests means that annual emission reduction targets of the kind that apply to other sectors are unsuitable. The long lead times needed for mitigation measures to take effect also set LULUCF apart from most other sectors. In view of this, the impact assessment indicated that a separate legal framework for LULUCF would be the preferred option. In terms of accounting, the suitable options identified included mandatory accounting of emissions and removals from both forestry and agricultural activities and giving equal weight to mitigation action irrespective of whether it was taken in the forestry, agriculture, related industries or energy sectors. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of this Decision is to establish robust and comprehensive accounting rules for LULUCF as well as to enable future policy development towards the full inclusion of LULUCF in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments when the conditions are right. To this end this Decision establishes a framework for: a mandatory accounting obligation on Member States as regards greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks associated with agricultural and forestry activities in the LULUCF sector and voluntary accounting for revegetation and wetland drainage and rewetting; the general accounting rules that must be applied; the specific accounting rules for afforestation, reforestation, deforestation, forest management, changes in the harvested wood products pool, cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation, and wetland drainage and rewetting; the specific rules for accounting for natural disturbances; adopting LULUCF Action Plans in Member States designed to limit or reduce emissions by sources and maintain or increase removals by sinks associated with LULUCF activities, and for the evaluation of those plans by the Commission; the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to: 1. update the definitions in the light of changes to definitions adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol or other multilateral agreement relevant to climate change concluded by the Union; 2. amend Annex I to add accounting periods and ensure consistency between those accounting periods and the relevant periods applicable to Union emission reduction commitments in other sectors, 3. amend Annex II with updated reference levels in accordance with the proposed reference levels submitted by Member States pursuant to Article 6 subject to corrections made in accordance with this Decision; 4. revise the information specified in Annex III in accordance with scientific progress and to revise the conditions relating to the accounting rules for natural disturbances laid down in Article 9(2) in the light of scientific progress or to reflect revisions to acts adopted by UNFCCC or Kyoto Protocol bodies.

BACKGROUND: Decision No 280/2004/EC concerning a mechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the Kyoto Protocol and its implementing provisions are the main monitoring, reporting, and verification instruments on GHG emissions. They set out the details for reporting anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks, for providing information on national programmes to reduce emissions, on GHG emission projections, and on climate change policies and measures in accordance with the UNFCCC. Six years of experience in implementing these two decisions and experience gained during international negotiations and in implementing various UNFCCC requirements have shown that there are areas where significant improvements could be made. In addition, the need to step up mitigation action at EU and Member State level and to fulfil new and upcoming international and domestic commitments, including the Europe 2020 strategy, requires an improved monitoring and reporting system. The Commission proposes replacing Decision No 280/2004/EC by a Regulation on account of the broader scope of the legislation, the increased number of addressees, the highly technical and harmonised nature of the monitoring mechanism, and to facilitate its implementation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a number of issues were dealt with in the impact assessment. These include: i) EU review and compliance cycle under the Effort Sharing Decision; ii) reporting requirements for emissions from international maritime transport; iii) reporting requirements related to the non-CO2 impacts of aviation on the global climate; iv) reporting requirements on adaptation; v) additional reporting requirements on LULUCF; v) reporting requirements on financial and technology support provided to developing countries; and vi) consistency with other EU legal instruments targeting air pollutants and improvements based on past experience with implementation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of this Regulation is to help the Union and its Member States meet their national, Union, and international commitments and goals and to further develop policy through transparent, accurate, consistent, comparable and complete reporting. It seeks to improve the availability of information for Union policy and decision-making and the coordination and consistency of Union and Member State reporting under the UNFCCC. the enhancement of the monitoring, reporting and review framework within the EU thus enabling implementation of domestic and international commitments and enabling implementation of current policies and effective further policy development; setting up a Union level review process of the GHG data submitted by the Member States hence ensuring that compliance with the ESD targets is assessed in a comprehensive, transparent, credible and timely manner, as stipulated in the Climate and Energy package; a prudent approach to reporting on emissions from international maritime transport and the LULUCF sector where policy discussions, both within the Union and internationally, are ongoing. It ensures that the monitoring mechanism provides an adequate framework for setting detailed reporting requirements at a later stage when a concrete policy outcome is reached, be it at international or Union level; ensuring coherence with existing Union policy on the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, as it requires for the Commission to assess biennially those impacts on the basis of the latest available emission data and scientific advancements; annual reporting so as to enable the annual assessment of the commitments made by the EU at the national and international level but also so as to enable early and effective corrective action; enhances, with regard to finance and technology, reporting on the basis of common methods, in line with the Union's obligation to provide transparent and complete information on the financial and technology support it provides to developing countries; the improvement of existing national systems in the Member States to address reporting on projections, policies and measures and provides consistency with other legal instruments targeting air pollutants; better quality assurance / quality control to increase the quality and completeness of the data provided and to simplify existing reporting requirements without imposing an undue administrative burden. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: with the development of e-commerce, the scope and size of markets in which businesses and consumers operate have grown significantly and extend beyond national borders. The lack of effective redress for complaints resulting from cross-border online transactions has adverse consequences both for consumers and businesses. Consumers as well as traders, however, perceive it as risky to engage in cross-border e-commerce transactions because they fear that relevant disputes might not easily be resolved due to the virtual character of the transaction. The Europe 2020 flagship initiative ""Digital Agenda for Europe"" announced an EU strategy to improve ADR systems. The 2011 Single Market Act included amongst its key priorities the establishment of simple, fast and affordable out-of-court settlement procedures for consumers and protecting relations between businesses and their customers. This action will also include an electronic commerce dimension. At present, the offer of ADR schemes to resolve consumer disputes related to e-commerce transactions is scattered and incomplete. In addition, while half the existing ADR schemes offer consumers the possibility of submitting their complaint online, very few offer consumers the possibility of conducting the entire procedure online (via online dispute resolution – ODR). Handling the entire process online would produce time savings and ease communication between the parties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has carried out a detailed impact assessment, analysing a range of policy options for (i) Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) coverage, information and quality and (ii) Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) for cross-border e-commerce transactions. The IA concluded that only a combination of two instruments on ADR and ODR can ensure access to impartial, transparent and effective means to resolve consumer disputes linked to cross-border e-commerce transactions out-of-court. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims at establishing an EU-wide ODR system that will facilitate the resolution of disputes related to the cross-border online sale of goods or provision of services between a trader and a consumer. The main points of the proposal are as follows: ODR platform : the proposal aims at establishing a European online dispute resolution platform (""ODR platform""). This ODR platform takes the form of an interactive website which offers a single point of entry to consumers and traders who seek to resolve out-of-court a dispute which has arisen from a cross-border e-commerce transaction. The platform can be accessed in all official languages of the EU and its use is free of charge. ADR schemes established in the Member States, which have been notified to the Commission in accordance with the Directive on consumer ADR, will be registered electronically with the ODR platform. Consumers and traders will be able to submit their complaints through an electronic complaint form which will be available on the platform’s website in all official languages of the EU. The platform will check if a complaint can be processed and seek the agreement of the parties to transmit it to the ADR scheme that is competent to deal with the dispute. The competent ADR scheme will seek the resolution of the dispute in accordance with its own rules of procedure within 30 days from the date of receipt of the complaint. The ADR scheme will have to notify to the platform some data in relation to the development of the dispute (date when the complaint was notified to the parties; date when the dispute was resolved; outcome of the dispute). Under the proposal, a network of online dispute resolution facilitators (""ODR facilitators' network"") will provide support to the resolution of disputes submitted via the ODR platform. Information on the EU-wide ODR system : traders established within the EU that engage in cross-border e- commerce to inform consumers about the ODR platform. This information shall be made easily, directly, prominently and permanently accessible on the traders' websites as well as when the consumer submit a complaint to the trader. Monitoring: an annual activity report will be drawn up on the operation of the platform. The compliance by ADR schemes with the obligations set out in the Regulation will be monitored by the competent authorities to be established in the Member States in accordance with the Directive on consumer ADR. Every three years the Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of the Regulation. Data Protection rules: the data entered in the ODR platform by the parties and the ADR schemes will be stored in a database and will be subject to the relevant legislation on data protection. BUDGETRY IMPLICATIONS: this action is part of the Consumer programme 2014-2020. The budgetary impact will be addressed by redeployment for the years 2012 and 2013. The financial appropriations for implementing this proposal from 2012 to 2020 will amount to EUR 4,586 million in current prices. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a substantial proportion of European consumers encounter problems when buying goods and services in the internal market. In 2010, this was the case for approximately 20% of European consumers. These problems are often left unresolved. The losses incurred by European consumers because of problems with purchased goods or services are estimated at 0.4% of the EU GDP. The Commission has adopted two Recommendations on consumer ADR and established two networks dealing with ADR (ECC-NET and FIN-Net). A number of EU sector-specific legislation contains a clause on ADR and Directive 2008/52/CE (the Mediation Directive) promotes the amicable settlement of disputes, including consumer disputes. However, the analysis of the current situation identified the following main shortcomings which hinder the effectiveness of ADR: gaps in the coverage, the lack of consumer and business awareness as well as the uneven quality of ADR procedures. The lack of effective ADR poses particular challenges in the context of cross-border transactions (e.g. language barriers, potentially higher costs, differences in legislation between Member States). In view of the problems identified, the Commission undertook to propose measures on ADR that ensure that all consumer complaints can be submitted to an ADR entity and that disputes arising from cross-border transactions could be more easily resolved. A proposal for a regulation on establishing a European platform facilitating out-of-court resolution of disputes is presented at the same time as this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has carried out a detailed impact assessment, analysing a range of policy options for (i) ADR coverage, information and quality and(ii) ODR for cross-border e-commerce transactions. The impact assessment concluded that only a combination of two instruments on ADR and ODR can ensure access to impartial, transparent, effective and fair means to resolve domestic and cross-border consumer disputes out-of-court. A Framework Directive is the most appropriate way to ensure full ADR coverage in all Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal aims to ensure that that disputes between consumers and traders can be submitted to entities offering impartial, transparent, effective and fair alternative dispute resolution procedures. The main points of the proposal are as follows: Ensuring that ADR procedures exist for all consumer disputes : Member States must ensure that all disputes between a consumer and a trader arising from the sale of goods or the provision of services can be submitted to an ADR entity, including through online means. The proposal applies to ADR entities that seek to resolve disputes between consumers and traders out-of-court through the intervention of a dispute resolution entity. It covers in particular mediation procedures but also non-judicial procedures of an adjudicatory nature, such as procedures before consumer complaint boards, arbitration and conciliation procedures. The proposal does not apply to consumer complaint handling systems operated by the trader nor to dispute resolution entities where the natural persons in charge of dispute resolution are employed exclusively by the trader. It also excludes direct negotiations between the parties. Information on ADR and cooperation : consumers must be able to find information on the competent ADR entity in the main commercial documents provided by the trader and, where a trader has a website, on that website. In addition, traders will have to inform consumers on whether or not they commit to use ADR in relation to complaints lodged against them by a consumer. Member States shall ensure that consumers can obtain assistance when they are involved in a cross-border dispute. They may delegate responsibility for this task to their centres of the European Consumer Centre Network (ECC-net), which currently performs the function of guiding consumers to the ADR entities competent to deal with their cross-border disputes. ADR entities will be encouraged to become members of networks of ADR entities in sector-specific areas when they deal with disputes in that area. The proposal contains provisions ensuring the respect of strict guarantees of confidentiality and data protection, in compliance with the relevant Union legislation. Quality of ADR entities : the proposal aims at ensuring that ADR entities respect the quality principles of impartiality, transparency, effectiveness and fairness. It provides that the parties should receive all the information they need to take an informed decision before engaging in an ADR procedure. Based on the results of existing studies, the proposal requires that disputes should be resolved within 90 days. It also provides that they should be free of charge or of moderate costs for consumers. Monitoring : in each Member State, a competent authority will be in charge of monitoring the functioning of ADR entities established on its territory. The competent authorities will inter alia assess, on the basis of information notified to them by ADR entities, whether a given ADR entity respects the quality requirements laid down by the proposal. In addition, the competent authorities will publish regular reports on the development and functioning of ADR entities. Every three years, the Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he unprecedented global crisis that has hit the world over the last three years has seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in the government deficit and debt position of the Member States, leading a number of them to seek financial assistance outside the framework of the Union. The full consistency between the Union multilateral surveillance framework established by the Treaty and the possible policy conditions attached to this financial assistance should be enshrined in Union law. The economic and financial integration of the Member States whose currency is the euro calls for a reinforced surveillance to prevent a contagion from a Member State experiencing difficulties with respect to its financial stability to the rest of the euro area. The intensity of the economic and fiscal surveillance should be commensurate to the severity of the financial difficulties encountered and should take due account of the nature of the financial assistance received, which may range from a mere precautionary support based on eligibility conditions up to a full macro-economic adjustment programme involving strict policy conditionality IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on strengthened surveillance for the euro area builds on what has already been agreed in the ‘Six Pack’ set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December. It sets out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and/or that receive or may receive financial assistance from one or several other States, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or other International Financial Institutions (IFI), such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Enhanced surveillance : the proposed Regulation strengthening economic and fiscal surveillance of euro area countries facing or threatened with serious financial instability would ensure that the surveillance of these Member States under a financial assistance programme, or facing a serious threat of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law. The Commission would be able to decide whether a Member State experiencing severe difficulties with regard to its financial stability should be subject to enhanced surveillance. The Council would be able to issue a recommendation to such Member States to request financial assistance. A Member State under enhanced surveillance shall, in consultation and cooperation with the Commission, acting in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties. The Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under surveillance to verify the progresses made in the implementation of the measures. Where it is concluded that further measures are needed and the financial situation of the Member State concerned has significant adverse effects on the financial stability of the euro area, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may recommend to the Member State concerned to seek financial assistance and to prepare a macro-economic adjustment programme. The Council may decide to make this recommendation public. Where a recommendation is made public: (a) the relevant Committee of the European Parliament may invite representatives of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views; (b) representatives of the Commission may be invited by the parliament of the Member State concerned to participate to an exchange of views. Macro-economic adjustment programme : a Member State receiving financial assistance from one or several other States, the IMF, the EFSF or the ESM shall prepare in agreement with the Commission - acting in liaison with the ECB - a draft adjustment programme aimed at re-establishing a sound and sustainable economic and financial situation and restoring its capacity to finance itself fully on the financial markets. The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall approve the adjustment programme. The Commission, in liaison with the ECB, shall monitor the progress made in the implementation of the adjustment programme . It shall - in liaison with the ECB - examine with the Member State concerned the changes that may be needed to its adjustment programme. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide on any change to be made to the adjustment programme. Post-programme surveillance : a Member State shall be under post-programme surveillance as long as a minimum of 75% of the financial assistance received from one or several other Member State(s), the EFSM, the EFSF or the ESM has not been repaid. The Council, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend the duration of the post programme surveillance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stability and Growth Pact has been further strengthened by Regulation No 1175/2011 and Regulation (EU) No 1177/2011 on the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Regulation (EC) No 1173/2011 on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area added a system of effective, preventive and gradual enforcement mechanisms in the form of financial sanctions for the Member States whose currency is the euro. These provisions have created a more robust framework at the level of the Union for the surveillance of national economic policies. The Treaty allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area that go beyond the provisions applicable to all Member States in order to ensure the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. Strong public finances are best ensured at the planning stage and gross errors should be identified as early as possible . Setting-up a common budgetary timeline for Member States whose currency is the euro should better synchronize the key steps in the preparation of national budgets, thus contributing to the effectiveness of the European semester for budgetary policy coordination. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136 in conjunction with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed regulation builds on what has already been agreed in the ‘Six Pack’ set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December 2011. It contains provisions to enhance both the coordination and the surveillance of budgetary processes for all euro area Member States: · complementing the European semester with a common budgetary timeline; · complementing the multilateral surveillance system of budgetary policies with additional monitoring requirements in order to ensure that Union policy recommendations in the budgetary area are appropriately integrated in the national budgetary preparations; · complementing the procedure for correction of a Member State's excessive deficit by a closer monitoring of budgetary policies of Member States subject to an excessive deficit procedure in order to secure a timely durable correction of excessive deficits. The proposed regulation would require Member States whose currency is the euro to present their draft budgets at the same time each year (by 15 April) and gives the Commission the right to assess and, if necessary, issue an opinion on them. The Commission could request that these drafts be revised, should it consider them to be seriously non-compliant with the policy obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. All of this would be done publically to ensure full transparency. The Eurogroup shall discuss opinions of the Commission on the national budgetary plans and the budgetary situation and prospects in the euro area as a whole on the basis of the overall assessment made by the Commission The proposal also contains new monitoring requirements – based on an obligation to communicate information to the Commission – to allow assessments to be made about the content and direction of fiscal policy at any point while a Member State is under an Excessive Deficit Procedure. Member States of the euro area must have in place an independent fiscal council for monitoring the implementation of national fiscal rules and base their budgets on independent macroeconomic forecasts. In order to enhance the dialogue between the Union institutions, in particular the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and to ensure greater transparency and accountability, the competent committee of the European Parliament may offer the opportunity to the Member State concerned by a Commission recommendation to participate in an exchange of views.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: venture capital provides finance to undertakings that are generally very small, in the initial stages of their corporate existence and display a strong potential for growth and expansion. While the United States, in the period from 2003-2010, channelled approximately EUR 131 billion into venture capital funds, European venture capital funds only managed to raise EUR 28 billion in this period. Compared with competing global centres of high-tech and innovation, most notably the United States, the European venture capital industry is fragmented and dispersed. In the reference period 2003-2010, funds dedicated to venture capital amounted to EUR 64 billion out of a total of EUR 437 billion invested in the wider field of private equity. As long as this bias in favour of private equity - a sector that invests in mature companies and organises leveraged buy-outs - persists, available funds are not channelled to equity finance to seed and start-up ventures that are at the make-or-break phase in their corporate development. The lack of financial resources that are currently directed towards venture capital is directly responsible for the sub-optimal size of the average European venture capital fund (VCF). In consequence, venture capital, at this stage, plays a minor role in the financing of SMEs. The absence of an efficient venture capital sector leads to European innovators and innovative business ventures punching below their commercial potential. This, in turn, has negative consequences for Europe's global competitiveness. Tackling these problems and supporting European entrepeneurs is therefore vital: · a thriving European venture capital market is an objective of the overall Europe 2020 Strategy, while the European Council of February 2011 called for the removal of remaining regulatory obstacles to cross border venture capital; · the European Commission undertook, in the Single Market Act, to ensure that by 2012 venture capital funds established in any Member State can raise capital and invest freely throughout the EU; · a new framework for venture capital funds is also one of the key priorities of the SME action plan which aims at fostering the growth of SMEs by improving their access to finance; · the Commission Communication entitled ""A roadmap to stability and growth"" also identified facilitating the access to venture capital as an important tool to boost growth within the EU. The proposed Regulation is complementary to the proposed Regulation on European Social Entrepreneurship Funds (EuSEFs). Both proposals aim to achieve different goals and both proposals, if adopted, will coexist as autonomous legal acts in mutual independence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. These alternatives contain a wide range of possible options: · introduce a new venture capital passport within Directive 2011/61/EC (AIFMD); · lower or abolish the thresholds of the AIFMD; · create special rules for venture capital as part of the implementing provisions of AIFM-D ('level 2'); · create a venture capital passport as a stand-alone legal instrument; · create an administrative network to enforce mutual recognition of national rules  governing venture capital or 'private placements'. The assessment concluded in favour of the creation of a venture capital passport as a stand-alone instrument. The preferred option is expected to benefit venture capital fund managers by improving their operating conditions in the EU, which will then lead to compliance and administrative cost reductions, and opening up new fund-raising opportunities. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT : the proposal aims principally at improving the reliability and legal certainty of marketing activities undertaken by operators using the designation ""European Venture Capital Fund"", by introducing: · uniform requirements for the managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Venture Capital Fund""; · requirements as to the investment portfolio , investment techniques and eligible undertakings that a qualifying venture capital fund may target; · uniform rules on which categories of investors a qualifying venture capital fund may target and on the internal organisation of the managers that market such qualifying funds. As managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Venture Capital Fund"" will be subject to identical substantive rules across the EU, they will benefit from uniform requirements for registration and an EU-wide passport, which will help create a level playing field for all participants in the venture capital market. In respect of the registration and supervision of the managers of ""European Venture Capital Funds"" the proposal aims at striking a balance between the need for effective supervision of European venture capital funds, the interest of the competent national authorities where such funds are either domiciled or offered to the eligible categories of investors and the coordinating role of ESMA. The competent authority in the Member State where the manager of the qualifying ""European Venture Capital Fund"" is domiciled will verify the registration documents submitted by the applicant manager and, having assessed whether the applicant provides sufficient guarantee of its ability to comply with the requirements of the Regulation, will register the applicant. In supervising the registered manager, the competent authority that has registered the manager will cooperate with the competent authorities in those Member States where the qualifying fund is marketed. ESMA will maintain a central database listing all registered managers that are eligible to use the designation “European Venture Capital Fund.” BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no budgetary implications. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: increasingly, investors are pursuing social goals and are not only seeking financial returns. In this way, a social investment market has been emerging in the Union, comprised in part by investment funds targeting social undertakings. According to the Global Enterprise Monitor 2009 report, between 3% and 7.5% of the workforce in selected EU Member States were employed in various forms of social businesses. Some estimates suggest social investments could grow rapidly to become a market well in excess of EUR 100 billion. Social businesses are almost exclusively SMEs and derive significant proportions of their funding from grants, whether from foundations, individuals or from the public sector. As businesses, however, their sustainable growth depends on drawing on a wider range of investments and financing sources. In this regard, the EU market for investment funds has begun to play a significant role, since a market for investment funds whose main objective is investing in social businesses has taken shape. In order to distinguish such targeted funds from wider social investment funds, these targeted funds are referred to as “social entrepreneurship funds” in this proposal. Evidence on regulatory and market failings shows two problems are limiting the growth of social entrepreneurship funds: (i) regulatory requirements at EU and national levels are not tailored to facilitate the raising of capital by these kinds of funds; (ii) social entrepreneurship funds are not flourishing across all Member States, but are currently geographically uneven in their distribution. Accordingly, it is necessary to lay down a common framework of rules regarding the use of the designation ""European Social Entrepreneurship Fund"", in particular on the composition of the portfolio of funds that operate under this designation, their eligible investment targets, the investment tools they may employ and the categories of investors that are eligible to invest in such funds by uniform rules in the Union. In the Single Market Act, the Commission undertook to put in train several measures to ensure EU social businesses can flourish, including by tackling such financing weaknesses. The current proposal is one initiative that delivers on that commitment. It forms part of the Commission's Social Business Initiative, which aims to tackle wider issues in this sector. It is complementary to the proposal on venture capital funds. Both proposals aim to achieve different goals and both proposals, if adopted, will coexist as autonomous legal acts in mutual independence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment identified two key problems: (1) information made available to investors pertaining to social undertakings, the investment policies and screening procedures followed by social entrepreneurship funds and the measurement of social impacts is either insufficient or not presented in a comparable manner; (2) regulatory approaches to the fundraising of organisations specialising in investments in social businesses were not sufficiently tailored to the specific needs of social entrepreneurship funds. The assessment identifies three key objectives: (i) improving the clarity and comparability of investment funds targeting social businesses; (ii) improving tools for assessing and analysing social impacts; and (iii) better reflecting the needs of social entrepreneurship funds in the rules applying to such funds across the Union. The impact assessment concluded in favour of a standalone framework for defining the funds and the rules applying to them, to facilitate national and cross border fund- raising including the development of a European 'brand' of social entrepreneurship funds supported by strong transparency measures. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 TFEU. CONTENT: the aim of the proposed Regulation is to create a legislative framework tailored to the needs of social undertakings, investors seeking to fund such undertakings, and the specialised investment funds that seek to mediate between the two. It aims to achieve a high level of clarity as to the characteristics that distinguish social entrepreneurship funds from the wider category of alternative investment funds. Only funds that comply with these characteristics shall be eligible to raise funds by virtue of the proposed European framework for social entrepreneurship funds. The proposed Regulation aims to addresses the problems identified by introducing: · uniform requirements for the managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Social Entrepreneurship Fund""; · requirements as to the investment portfolio, investment techniques and eligible undertakings that a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund may target; · uniform rules on which categories of investors a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund may target and on the internal organisation of the managers that market such qualifying funds. The proposed Regulation also takes the special characteristics of social undertakings into account. Social undertakings have the achievement of positive social impact as their principle objective. Therefore, this Regulation requires that a qualifying portfolio undertaking should have a measurable and positive social impact, use its profits to achieve its primary objective and that it is managed in an accountable and transparent way. As managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Social Entrepreneurship Fund"" will be subject to identical substantive rules across the EU, they will benefit from uniform requirements for registration and an EU-wide passport, which will help create a level playing field for all participants in the market for the funding of social entrepreneurs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no budgetary implications.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: ESA is an essential tool at European level, used for major administrative purposes (e.g. own resources, excessive deficit procedure, structural funds) and for the analysis of the coordination and convergence of Member States’ economic policies. The ESA provides EU institutions, governments and economic and social operators with a set of harmonised and reliable statistics on which to base their decisions. The ESA revision follows the revision of the International System of National Accounts (SNA 93). The new SNA (2008 SNA) was published in 2009 by the five international organisations which worked on the new Manual (IMF, OECD, UN Statistical Division, World Bank and Eurostat) in order to bring national accounts more in line with the new economic environment. There is a need to revise the European system of accounts (ESA 95) set up by Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 in order to take into account these new developments so that that system constitutes a version of 2008 SNA adapted to the structures of the Member States' economies, and so that the data of the Union are comparable with those compiled by its main international partners. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: if ESA was not revised, this would weaken the comparability of national accounts and aggregates, first between Member States as the revision will be the occasion to specify new methodological rules for issues that have emerged in the fifteen last years, secondly at international level as SNA has just been revised. LEGAL BASE: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the proposed Regulation (ESA 2010) is to revise ESA both concerning the methodology on common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, and the programme for transmitting for Union purposes accounts and tables compiled according to the methodology. ESA 2010 is gradually to replace all other systems as a reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the requirements of the Union, so that results that are comparable between the Member States can be obtained. The proposal includes a methodology and a transmission programme (which defines accounts and tables to be provided by all Member States according to specified deadlines). The Commission should make those accounts and tables available to users on precise dates, particularly with regard to monitoring the economic convergence and achieving close coordination of the Member States' economic policies.  Attention should be paid in the case of environmental and social accounts to the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 20 August 2009 entitled "" GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world "". Therefore, further methodological studies and data tests may be required, in particular on issues related to GDP and beyond and Europe 2020 with the aim of developing a more comprehensive measurement approach for wellbeing and progress in order to support the promotion of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. Taking into consideration the findings of the task force, it may be necessary to amend the methodology for the calculation and allocation of Fisim, by means of a delegated act before the end of 2012, in order to provide more reliable results. Lastly, research and development expenditure has the nature of investment and should therefore be recorded as fixed capital formation. However, it is necessary to specify the format of the data to be recorded as fixed capital formation by means of a delegated act when a sufficient level of confidence in the reliability of the data is reached. The proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was set up in March 2004 for an initial period of five years by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 . Regulation (EC) No 1007/2008 extended ENISA’s mandate until March 2012. The extension of ENISA’s mandate in 2008 also launched a debate on the general direction of European efforts towards network and information security (NIS), to which the Commission contributed by launching a public consultation (which ran from November 2008 to January 2009 and gathered nearly 600 contributions). On 30 March 2009, the Commission adopted a Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) focusing on the protection of Europe from cyber attacks and cyber disruptions by enhancing preparedness, security and resilience, with an Action Plan calling on ENISA to play a role, mainly in support to Member States. The Action Plan was broadly endorsed in the discussion at the Ministerial Conference on CIIP held in Tallinn, Estonia, on 27 and 28 April 2009. The European Union Presidency’s Conference Conclusions stress the importance of the need torethink and reformulate the Agency’s mandate. ENISA was originally created with the main goal of ensuring a high and effective level of network and information security within the Union. However, given the experience gained with the Agency, as well as the current challenges and threats to network and information security (NIS), it is necessary to modernise its mandate to make it better fit the European Union’s needs. These stem from a variety of factors such as: the fragmentation of national approaches to tackling the evolving challenges; the lack of collaborative models in the implementation of NIS policies; the insufficient level of preparedness also due to the limited European early warning and response capability; the lack of reliable European data and limited knowledge about evolving problems; the low level of awareness of NIS risks and challenges; and the challenge of integrating NIS aspects in policies to fight cybercrime more effectively. This proposal for the recast of the ENISA Regulation therefore seeks to address these new challenges by revising the Agency’s mandate. It should be noted that another proposal has been issued in parallel which would extend the current mandate of the Agency until September 2013, the time it is estimated that will be required for the institutions to agree on the text of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: starting from the principle that keeping an Agency had been identified as an appropriate solution for attaining European policy objectives, five policy options were selected for further analysis: Option 2: carry on as before, i.e., with a similar mandate and the same level of resources; Option 3 : expand the tasks of ENISA, adding law enforcement and privacy protection authorities as fully fledged stakeholders; Option 4: add fighting cyber attacks and response to cyber incidents to its tasks; Option 5 : add supporting law enforcement and judicial authorities in fighting cybercrime to its tasks. Following a comparative cost-benefit analysis, option 3 was identified as the most cost-effective and efficient way of achieving the policy objectives because ENISA’s role would focus on: i) building and maintaining a liaison network between stakeholders and a knowledge network to ensure that ENISA is comprehensively informed of the European NIS landscape; ii) being the NIS support centre for policy development and policy implementation; iii) supporting the Union CIIP & Resilience policy; iv) setting up an Union framework for the collection of NIS data; v) studying the economics of NIS; vi) stimulating cooperation with third countries and international organisations; vii) performing non-operational tasks related to NIS aspects of cybercrime law enforcement and judicial cooperation. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to strengthen and modernise ENISA and to establish a new mandate for a period of five years. The proposal includes some key changes as compared to the original Regulation: Tasks of the Agency: ENISA’s tasks are updated and reformulated broadly, in order to provide more scope for Agency activities; they are sufficiently precise to depict the means by which the objectives are to be achieved. assist the Commission with policy development in the area of network and information security by providing it with advice by means of opinions and technical and socio-economic analyses, as well as undertaking preparatory work on the preparation and updating of EU legislation in this field; facilitate cooperation among the Member States and between the Member States and the Commission to prevent, detect, mitigate and respond to network and information security problems and incidents; assist the Member States and the European institutions and bodies in their efforts to collect, analyse and disseminate network and information security data; facilitate cooperation among the Member States’ competent public bodies, in particular supporting the development and exchange of good practices and standards; assist the Union and the Member States in promoting the use of risk management and security good practice and standards for electronic products, systems and services; encourage cooperation among public and private stakeholders and facilitate dialogue and exchanges of best practice at all levels in particular on aspects of the fight against cybercrime; assist the Commission on policy developments that take into account NIS aspects of the fight against cybercrime; carry out tasks conferred on the Agency by Union legislative acts. The Agency’s new mandate would permit: The European institutions and bodies could refer to it for assistance and advice which is in line with political and regulatory developments. Law enforcement and privacy protection authorities would become fully fledged stakeholders of the Agency, which would mean it would become a key interface in the fight against cybercrime. Management : on the organisational level, the main proposed changes relate to the following - strengthened governance structure . the proposal enhances the supervisory role of the Agency’s Management Board, in which the Member States and the Commission are represented. For example, the Management Board is able to issue general directions on staff matters (previously the sole responsibility of the Executive Director). It may also establish working bodies to assist it in carrying out its tasks, including monitoring the implementation of its decisions. - streamlining procedures: procedures that have proved to be unnecessarily burdensome are simplified. simplified procedure for Management Board internal rules; the opinion on the ENISA Work programme is provided by Commission services rather than via a Commission Decision. In addition, the Management Board is also given adequate resources in case it needs to take executive decisions and implement them (e.g., if a staff member lodges a complaint against the Executive Director or the Board itself). - gradual increase of resources : to meet the reinforced European priorities and the expanding challenges, without prejudice to the Commission's proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework, a gradual increase of the financial and human resources of the Agency are gradually to be increased between 2012 and 2016 is anticipated (see financial implication below). - option of extending the term of office of the Executive Director: the Management Board may extend the term of office of the Executive Director for three years. Review clause : the Regulation provides for an evaluation of the Agency, covering the period since the previous evaluation in 2007. Based on the findings, the Management Board will make recommendations to the Commission regarding changes to this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices. To enable the Commission to draft any proposal for an extension of the mandate in good time, the evaluation will have to be done by the end of the second year of the mandate provided by the Regulation. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: The proposal will impact on the Union budget. It is anticipated that the Agency will be given the resources required to carry out its activities satisfactorily. EU funding after 2013 will be examined in the context of a Commission-wide debate on all proposals for the post-2013 period. This means that once the Commission has made its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework, the Commission will present an amended legislative financial statement taking into account the conclusions of the impact assessment."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress has been made in the International Civil Aviation Organisation towards the adoption at the 2013 ICAO Assembly of a framework facilitating States' application of market-based measures to emissions from international aviation, and on developing a global market-based measure. In order to facilitate this progress and provide momentum, it is desirable to defer enforcement of requirements relating to flights to and from aerodromes outside the Union and areas with close economic connections to the Union and a shared commitment to tackle climate change arising prior to the 2013 ICAO Assembly. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal for a Decision seeks to enhance the chances of a successful outcome of the 2013 ICAO Assembly in terms of developing a global market-based measure (MBM) and adopting a framework facilitating States' application of market-based measures to international aviation. The Decision would ""stop the clock,"" by temporarily deferring enforcement of the obligations of aircraft operators in respect of incoming and outgoing flights under the European Union's Emission Trading System (ETS). Action should therefore not be taken against aircraft operators in respect of requirements resulting from Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community arising before 1 January 2014 as regards incoming and outgoing flights. The condition for this is that they have either not received, or have returned, 2012 free allocations granted for such activities to or from aerodromes outside the EU and closely connected areas with a shared commitment to tackle climate change. Proper monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions from such flights is welcomed, but no compliance sanctions will be applied in respect of the non-reporting of such emissions. Directive 2003/87/EC continues to apply in full in respect of flights between aerodromes in the EU and closely connected areas with a shared commitment to tackle climate change. To provide further momentum to the international discussions and continue EU leadership in this process, the Commission considers it is important that this proposal is agreed between the European Parliament and Council swiftly and ideally by March 2013. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/EC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions have been substantially modified several times. Many of the provisions of these two directives are applicable both to credit institutions and investment firms. To ensure the consistent application of these measures, it is appropriate to merge them in order to create new legislation applicable to both types of entity. This new legislation will comprise two different legal instruments. In this proposal for a Directive, are the provisions concerning the authorisation of credit institutions and the exercise of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services. The accompanying proposal for a Regulation establishes uniform and directly applicable prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms. This new elements in this proposal comprise provisions on sanctions, effective corporate governance and provisions preventing the over-reliance on external credit ratings. Sanctions : the sanctions applicable for key violations of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), such as authorisation requirements, prudential obligations and reporting obligations, vary across Member States and do not seem always appropriate to ensure sanctions are sufficiently effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Furthermore, there is a certain divergence in the level of application of sanctions in different Member States. In its 2010 Communication ""Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial sector"", the Commission has envisaged EU legislative action to set minimum common standards on certain key issues of sanctioning regimes, to be adapted to the specifics of the different sectors. Corporate governance : strengthening corporate governance is a priority for the Commission, especially in the context of its financial markets reform and crisis prevention programme. The public consultation launched as a result of its Green Paper on corporate governance in financial institutions and remuneration policies demonstrated a broad consensus on the deficiencies of corporate governance standards and practices in the financial services sector. In a resolution, adopted in July 2010, the European Parliament also recognised the importance of strengthening corporate governance standards and practices in financial institutions. Over-reliance on external ratings : overreliance on credit ratings may lead to herding behaviour of financial actors, e.g. parallel selling-off of debt instruments after that instrument has been downgraded below investment grade, which may affect financial stability. At the international level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recently issued principles to reduce authorities’ and financial institutions’ reliance on external ratings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a series of options was analysed to define the legal framework for sanctioning regimes and corporate governance: the options on sanctioning regimes are expected to facilitate detection of violations and to empower competent authorities to apply appropriate sanctions. This is expected to ensure better enforcement of the CRD obligations by credit institutions, which would benefit all stakeholders; the preferred policy options improving corporate governance will help avoid excessive risk-taking by credit institutions and lower the risk of failure. It would contribute to the resilience of the banking sector and improve investor confidence The impact on credit institutions and all stakeholders (depositors, shareholders, creditors) should be positive; as regards over-reliance on external ratings, the impact assessment of the new initiative on credit rating agencies (planned for early July 2011) will; include a general chapter on over-reliance covered by these proposals. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC with regard to the coordination of national provisions governing the authorisation of the business, the acquisition of qualifying holdings, the exercise of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services, the powers of supervisory authorities of home and host Member States in this regard and the provisions governing the initial capital and the supervisory review of credit institutions and investment firms. Its main objective is to coordinate national provisions concerning the access to the activity of credit institutions and investment firms, the modalities for their governance, and their supervisory framework. The proposal seeks to ensure the smooth operation of the banking sector and restoring confidence in it by: introducing an effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctioning regime to ensure compliance with the CRD rules; development of a level playing field which minimises the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage; effective supervision of banking service providers; effective corporate governance within credit institutions which should contribute to avoid excessive risk taking. The main features of the proposal are as follows: 1) Sanctions : with a view to reinforcing and approximating the legal framework concerning sanctions and the mechanisms facilitating detection of breaches, the Directive will require Member States to comply with the following minimum rules: make provision for administrative sanctions and measures that are applicable to natural and legal persons responsible for violations, which would include credit institutions, investment companies and individuals, where appropriate; in case of a breach, a minimum set of administrative sanctions and measures should be available to competent authorities. This includes withdrawal of authorisation, cease and desist orders, public statement, dismissal of management, administrative pecuniary sanctions; the maximum level of administrative pecuniary sanctions laid down in national legislation should exceed the benefits derived from the violation if they can be determined; sanctions and measures applied should be published. Lastly, appropriate mechanism should be put in place to encourage reporting of breaches within credit institutions and investment firms. 2) Corporate governance: with a view to reinforcing the legislative framework regarding corporate governance, the proposal provides for: i) improving the effectiveness of management bodies to oversee risks; ii) improve the stature of the risk management function; and iii) ensure the effective follow-up of risk management by the supervisory authorities. The management body of a credit institution or investment firm as a whole should commit sufficient time and possess adequate knowledge, skills and experience to be able to understand the business of the credit institution and its main risk exposures. All members of the management body should be of sufficiently good repute and possess individual qualities and independence of mind which enable them to constructively challenge and oversee the decisions of the management. To avoid group think and facilitate critical challenge, management boards of credit institutions should be sufficiently diverse as regards age, gender, geographical provenance, educational and professional background. The management body should be responsible and accountable for the overall risk strategy of the credit institution or investment firm and for the adequacy of the risk management systems, taking into account the credit institution's risk profile. Credit institutions and investment firms should have an independent risk management function. 3) Over-reliance on external ratings : overall, the directive seeks to encourage banks to rely on internal ratings rather than external ones to calculate their regulatory capital requirements. In addition, it is proposed that EBA publicly discloses, on an annual basis, information on the steps taken by institutions and by supervisory authorities to reduce over-reliance on external ratings and reports on the degree of supervisory convergence in this regard. 4) Capital buffers: on the basis of Basel III, this proposal introduces two capital buffers on top of the requirements: a Capital Conservation Buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer. the Capital Conservation Buffer amounts to 2,5% of risk weighted assets, applies at all times and has to be met with capital of highest quality. It is aimed at ensuring institutions' capacity to absorb losses in stressed periods that may span a number of years; the Countercyclical Capital Buffer is set by national authorities for loans provided to natural and legal persons within their Member State. It can be set between 0% and 2.5% of risk weighted assets and has to be met by capital of highest quality likewise. If justified, authorities can even set a buffer beyond 2.5%. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer will be required during periods of excessive credit growth and released in a downturn. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the Union’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions conferring on the Commission the right to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the extent of the financial crisis has exposed unacceptable risks pertaining to the current regulation of financial institutions. According to IMF estimates, crisis-related losses incurred by European credit institutions between 2007 and 2010 are close to €1 trillion or 8% of the EU GDP. In order to restore stability in the banking sector and ensure that credit continues to flow to the real economy, both the EU and its Member States adopted a broad range of unprecedented measures with the taxpayer ultimately footing the related bill. In this context, by October 2010 the Commission has approved €4.6 trillion of state aid measures to financial institutions of which more than €2 trillion were effectively used in 2008 and 2009. The level of fiscal support provided to credit institutions needs to be matched with a robust reform addressing the regulatory shortcomings exposed during the crisis. Priorities and challenges : it should be noted that one of the priorities of the Commission in the reform of EU financial services regulation has been to ensure that the banking sector is able to fulfil its fundamental purpose, namely lending to the real economy and providing services to citizens and businesses in Europe. The proposal is designed to tackle regulatory shortcomings in the following areas: Management of liquidity risk : existing liquidity risk management practices were shown by the crisis to be inadequate in fully grasping risks linked to originate-to-distribute securitization, use of complex financial instruments and reliance on wholesale funding with short term maturity instruments. Definition of capital : institutions entered the crisis with capital of insufficient quantity and quality. Given the risks they faced, many institutions did not posses sufficient amounts of the highest quality capital instruments that can absorb losses effectively as they arise and help to preserve an institution as a going concern. Counterparty credit risk : the crisis revealed a number of shortcomings in the current regulatory treatment of counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives, repo and securities financing activities. It showed that the existing provisions did not ensure appropriate management and adequate capitalisation for this type of risk. Options, discretions and harmonisation (entire Regulation) : in 2000, seven banking directives were replaced by a single Directive. This directive was recast in 2006 while introducing the Basel II framework in the EU. As a result, its current provisions include a significant number of options and discretions. Moreover, Member States have been permitted to impose stricter rules than those of the Directive. As a result, there is a high level of divergence which is particularly burdensome for firms operating cross-border. It also gives rise to the lack of legal clarity and an uneven playing field. Action at international level : the G20 Declaration of 2 April 2009 on Strengthening of the Financial System called for internationally consistent efforts that are aimed at strengthening transparency, accountability and regulation by, improving the quantity and quality of capital in the banking system once the economic recovery is assured. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued detailed rules of new global regulatory standards on credit institution capital adequacy and liquidity that collectively are referred to as Basel III. This proposal directly relates to the regulatory standards included in Basel III. At the same time, in the process of developing this legislative proposal, the Commission has made particular efforts in making sure that certain major European specificities and issues are appropriately addressed. Creating a new legal framework : Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/EC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (""institutions"") have been significantly amended on several occasions. Many provisions of Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC are applicable to both credit institutions and investment firms. In order to ensure a coherent application of those provisions, it would be desirable to merge these provisions into new legislation applicable to both credit institutions and investment firms. For sake of clarity, the provisions of the Annexes to those Directives should be integrated into the enacting terms of this new legislation. That new legislation should consist of two different legal instruments, a Directive and this Regulation. Together, both legal instruments should form the legal framework governing the access to the activity, the supervisory framework and the prudential rules for credit institutions and investment firms. This Regulation should therefore be read together with the Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: altogether, 27 policy options have been assessed and compared with a view to addressing the various issues identified. Preferred options are as follows: · Introduce Liquid Coverage Ratio (LCR) adopted by Basel Committee subject to observation period. · Introduce Net Stable Funding ratio (NSFR) adopted by Basel Committee subject to observation period. · Modify eligibility criteria and regulatory adjustments based on Basel approach, with some adjustments for EU specificities. · Enhance Counterparty credit risk (CCR) requirements and differentiate treatment of exposures to Central Counterparties. · Introduce leverage ratio. · Conduct extensive monitoring of leverage ratio. · Conservation capital buffer. · Maximum harmonization with some exceptions. · Limit scope of the CRD and propose a regulation. Cumulative impacts of the proposed package are as follows: this proposal together with CRD III is estimated to increase the risk-weighted assets of large credit institutions by 24.5% and of small credit institutions by a modest 4.1%; the need to raise new own funds due to the new requirement and the conservation buffer is estimated to be €84 billion by 2015 and €460 billion by 2019; there are clear net long term economic benefits of an annual increase in the EU GDP in the range of 0.3%-2%. They stem from a reduction in the expected frequency and probability of future systemic crises; the proposal would reduce the probability of a systemic banking crisis in seven Member States within the range of 29% to 89% when credit institutions recapitalise to a total capital ratio of at least 10.5%. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114(1) TFEU provides a legal basis for a Regulation creating uniform provisions aimed at the functioning of the internal market. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation streamlines the prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, which are currently set out in two different Directives (2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC), in one legal instrument, which considerably simplifies the applicable legal framework. The individual policy measures proposed are as follows: Management of liquidity risk : To improve short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of financial institutions, a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) will be introduced after an observation and review period in 2015. LCR would require institutions to match net liquidity outflows during a 30 day period with a buffer of 'high quality' liquid assets. The outflows covered (the denominator) would reflect both institution-specific and systemic shocks built upon actual circumstances experienced in the global financial crisis. The provisions on the list of high quality liquid assets (the numerator) to cover these outflows should ensure that these assets are of high credit and liquidity quality. Based on the LCR definition included in Basel III, compliance with this requirement in the EU is expected to produce net annual GDP benefits in the range of 0.1% to 0.5%, due to a reduction in the expected frequency of systemic crises. To address funding problems arising from asset-liability maturity mismatches, the Commission will consider proposing a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) after an observation and review period in 2018. Definition of capital : The proposal builds upon the changes made in CRD2 to strengthen further the criteria for eligibility of capital instruments. Furthermore, it introduces significant harmonisation of the adjustments made to accounting equity in order to determine the amount of regulatory capital that it is prudent to recognise for regulatory purposes. This new harmonised definition would significantly increase the amount of regulatory capital required to be held by institutions. The new requirements for going concern regulatory capital - Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital - would be implemented gradually between 2013 and 2015. The new prudential adjustments would also be introduced gradually, 20% per annum from 2014, reaching 100% in 2018. Grandfathering provisions over 10 years would also apply to certain capital instruments in order to help to ensure a smooth transition to the new rules. Counterparty credit risk : Requirements for management and capitalisation of the counterparty credit risk will be strengthened. Institutions would be subject to an additional capital charge for possible losses associated with the deterioration in the creditworthiness of a counterparty. Risk weights on exposures to financial institutions relative to the non-financial corporate sector will be raised. The proposal would also enhance incentives for clearing over-the-counter instruments through central counterparties. Leverage ratio : in order to limit an excessive build-up of leverage on credit institutions' and investment firms' balance sheets and thus help containing the cyclicality of lending, the Commission also proposes to introduce a non-risk based leverage ratio. As agreed by BCBS, it will be introduced as an instrument for the supervisory review of institutions. The impacts of the ratio will be monitored with a view to migrating it to a binding pillar one measure in 2018, based on appropriate review and calibration, in line with international agreements. Single rule book (entire Regulation): the proposal harmonises divergent national supervisory approaches by removing options and discretions almost altogether. Some specific well defined areas, where divergences are driven by risk assessment considerations, market or product specificities and Member States' legal frameworks, are exempted, allowing Member States to adopt stricter rules. BUDGETARY IMPACT: EBA will play an important role in achieving the objective of this Regulation, as the proposals ask it to develop more than 50 binding technical standards (BTS) on various policy issues. BTS – which would eventually be endorsed by the Commission – will be key to ensure that provisions of highly technical nature are implemented uniformly across the EU and that the proposed policies work as intended. For this significant workload, EBA would need more resources than those already provided within the context of its establishment under Regulation (EU) 1093/2010. Further details are set out in the attached legislative financial statement. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Commission and stakeholders' estimations, the revenues of groundhandling (all categories included) amount globally to EUR 50 billion. It is estimated that the sector employs at least 60,000 persons in Europe. The cost linked to groundhandling services for airlines represents 5 to 12% of operating costs. In 1996 the European Community adopted Council Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports. The Directive was a first step towards the gradual opening and harmonisation of access to the groundhandling market. It would appear from the consultation organised by the Commission and the evaluation of the Directive in force that the current legal framework is no longer fit for purpose. The problem identified is twofold: (i) the provision of groundhandling services is not efficient enough due to barriers to entry and expansion, and (ii) the overall quality of groundhandling services is not keeping pace with evolving needs in terms of reliability, resilience, safety and security and the environment. It is therefore necessary to improve the efficiency and the overall quality of groundhandling services with the following objectives: ensure airlines have an increased choice of groundhandling solutions at EU airports; harmonise and clarify national administrative conditions for market entry (approvals); ensure a level playing field at airport level between groundhandling companies operating under different regulatory regimes; increase coordination between groundhandling providers at the airport (airport operators as ground coordinators within the EU aviation network as part of the gate-to-gate approach); clarify the legal framework for training of staff and transfer of staff. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four policy packages (in addition to the option to keep the existing framework) were considered to assess how Directive 96/67/EC could be revised Policy package PP1 would improve the system via minimal Directive amendments and by providing guidance where possible. Policy package PP2 seeks to improve the current system through a more ambitious set of measures. Policy package PP3 seeks to improve the current system with high intensity policy measures, providing full harmonisation of the groundhandling market legal framework. Only the policy package PP2 fully satisfies the identified objectives as demonstrated in the impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal concerns the adoption of a regulation on groundhandling services at EU airports. The new regulation is intended to replace and repeal the existing Directive 96/67/EC. Full opening of the self-handling market and increase in the minimum number of service providers to three at large airports: every airport user should be allowed to self-handle. Moreover, the number of authorised third-party suppliers of groundhandling services should not be less than three suppliers at large airports with not less than 5 million passengers annually or 100 000 tonnes of freight. Mutual recognition of approvals with harmonised requirements: the mutual recognition of national approvals with harmonised requirements will reduce administrative costs for operators and reduce barriers to entry. Better management of centralised infrastructures: the proposal includes a clear legal framework for the definition of centralised infrastructure and for the fees to be charged to suppliers of groundhandling services and self-handling airlines for the centralised infrastructure. Legal separation of airports and their groundhandling activities : the proposal provides that if an airport is itself a provider of groundhandling services, it should be ensured that the groundhandling services provided by the airport do not unduly benefit from the airport management activities of the airport. Improved tender procedure : the proposal provides for an increase of the maximum duration for which a supplier of restricted groundhandling services is selected from 7 to 10 years. It contains further specifications on the details of the selection procedure for the suppliers of restricted services to ensure a harmonious application and ensure that selected companies are indeed those best suited to operate groundhandling services. In the selection of the supplier for restricted groundhandling services the AUC needs to be consulted. The proposal contains provisions for rules of procedure for the Airport Users' Committee to avoid any conflict of interest for airlines also providing groundhandling services. Clarified rules for subcontracting: the proposal contains clear rules for subcontracting allowing suppliers of groundhandling services to subcontract but limiting subcontracting by airports and self-handling airlines to situations of force majeure and prohibiting cascade subcontracting. Role of the managing body of the airport in the coordination of ground services: the managing body of the airport should be responsible for the proper coordination of groundhandling activities at its airport. Moreover, at large airports, which are particularly important for the European air transport network, the managing body of the airport needs to ensure that these operations are coordinated through an airport CDM and through a proper contingency plan. Responsibility of airport operators for minimum quality requirements for groundhandling operations to be defined in delegated act : the proposal provides the setting of minimum quality standards for the performance of groundhandling services to be met by all suppliers of groundhandling service and self-handling airport users. Reporting obligations on performance of groundhandling services (to be defined in delegated act): suppliers of groundhandling services and self-handling airport users should be required to report on the performance of their groundhandling services. Compulsory minimum training for staff: the proposal introduces minimum training requirements for all suppliers of groundhandling services and self-handling airlines to ensure the safety and security of operations and to create a level playing field among operators. Possibility for Member States to impose a requirement to take over staff with same conditions where there is a tender procedure: the tender system appears to encourage turnover of staff. Discontinuity of staff can have a detrimental effect on the quality of groundhandling services. It is therefore appropriate to clarify the rules on the takeover of staff beyond the application of Directive 2001/23/EC on transfers of undertakings and to enable Member States to ensure adequate employment and working conditions. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: during the fisheries consultations in 2010 between EU and Norway it was agreed to set up a Working Group to improve the control and enforcement measures in the fisheries in the Skagerrak, and to recommend ways to harmonise EU and Norwegian technical and control measures regulations in the area outside 4 nautical miles from the baselines. This Working Group on Technical Measures and Control in Skagerrak met during 2011 and reported in October 2011. In April 2012 the recommendations were included in the agreed record signed by EU and Norway. Against this background and in order to follow the objective of the CFP to ensure sustainable use of living aquatic resources and to eradicate discarding as unsustainable practice it is desirable to enact the recommendations listed in the Agreed Records in Union legislation. The provisions laid down in the present proposal are specific to the Skagerrak and the fisheries therein and hence do not form any precedent for the debate on the reform of the CFP. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the rules to be adopted will be applicable only in the Skagerrak, and are in the context of an EU-Norway international agreement. The EU-Norway agreement was based on the recommendations made by the technical Working Group, with stakeholder participation, that examined in detail the various options available in order to allow the continuation of the traditional fisheries in the Skagerrak following the expiry of the Skagerrak neighbourhood agreement. This Working Group is deemed to represent a sufficient alternative to the impact assessment. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENTS: the provisions of the proposal relate to changes to the technical measures in place in the Skagerrak in order to reduce the level of unwanted catches and discards where they negatively affect the sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources. The proposed changes aim, in particular: ·  to establish an obligation to land all catches of stocks subject to catch limits; ·  to introduce the obligation to land progressively; ·  to ensure that the handling of juvenile fish is limited to fish meal, pet food or other non-human consumption products, or for charitable purposes; ·  to improve the selectivity of the fishing gears by increasing the general minimum mesh size requirement for demersal fisheries but with derogations; ·  to restrict the use of fishing gears in the Skagerrak; ·  to establish certain measures to govern issues when on a given fishing trip fishing vessels combine their fishing activities in the Skagerrak with fishing in areas where the new technical measures adopted for the Skagerrak are not to be applied; ·  to adopt specific control measures in addition to those provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009; ·  to extend the use of prior notification as requested by Regulation (EC) 1224/2009 to cover all vessels with an overall length of 10 m or more and the prior notifications should be submitted two hours in advance to adapt to the fisheries; ·  to operate a Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) system on vessels operating in the Skagerrak; ·  to oblige Member States concerned to define a control and inspection measures for the Skagerrak and to incorporate these measures into their respective national control action programmes; ·  to provide rules for vessels transiting the Skagerrak in order to ensure that the new technical measures are respected. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions allowing the Commission the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the magnitude and characteristics of accidents affecting offshore oil and gas operations (for example, Deepwater Horizon in the US in 2010, Montara in Australia in 2009, Usumacinta in Mexico in 2007) which have been reported worldwide, including the Union, demand action. Studies, stakeholder consultations and risk analyses conducted since 2010 have identified the main problems for the Union as: The risk of a major offshore oil or gas accident occurring in Union waters is significant and the existing fragmented legislation and diverse regulatory and industry practices do not provide for all achievable reductions in the risks throughout the Union. The existing regulatory framework and operating arrangements do not provide for the most effective emergency response to accidents wherever they occur in Union waters, and the liabilities for clean-up and conventional damages are not fully clear. Based on frequency analysis of industry performance in Europe to date and on documented costs of past accidents, the estimated average annual economic losses and damage from offshore oil and gas accidents in the Union range from EUR 205 million to EUR 915 million. This range is used as the empirical basis of baseline risk in the impact assessment. It is estimated that the benefits accruing to the Union and Member States significantly outweigh the costs of introducing higher standards. According to the Commission, the control of major hazard risks in the offshore industry needs to be raised to consistently high standards throughout the Union. Four specific objectives need to be pursued: 1) Ensure a consistent use of best practices for major hazards control by oil and gas industry offshore operations potentially affecting Union waters or shores; 2) Implement best regulatory practices in all European jurisdictions with offshore oil and gas activities; 3) Strengthen Union's preparedness and response capacity to deal with emergencies potentially affecting Union citizens, economy or environment; 4) Improve and clarify existing Union liability and compensation provisions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the reference option which would preserve the status quo (Option 0), four strategic options were evaluated: Option 1 (""North Sea basic"") is the basic level for meaningful Union intervention. It introduces in Union law the Major Hazards Report (MHR) based upon the safety and health document required by Directive 92/91/EC but goes further in requiring the regulator to be satisfied with it prior to starting operations. An inspections and penalties regime would be required to underpin the measures described in the MHR. Option 1+ (""North Sea +"") goes further by introducing soft law guidelines for tightening consideration of the technical capacity of applicants for offshore oil and gas licenses; Option 2 (""Union Best practice"") develops further the reforms of option 1+ in a comprehensive package. Recognised global best practice in major hazard risk control would be mandated, and environmental risk assessment would be incorporated into the MHR. Also, best regulatory practice and required organisational standards would be introduced in arrangements for national competent authorities; Option 3 (""EU Agency"") further reinforces the impact of Option 2 by introducing an Union agency to institutionalise and thereby consolidate the reforms achieved by option 2. It would undertake inspections and investigations, monitor and enforce consistency in performance, develop intervention capacity and assist capacity building in adjacent non Union countries. The preferred policy option is Option 2, i.e. a comprehensive offshore reform raising throughout Union, through new law, the level of risk management and emergency preparedness in the offshore industry. The cost of the proposed measures (EUR 134 – 140 million/year) is modest when compared with the risk reduction that they would guarantee (EUR 103-455 million/year). LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 of the TFEU (Environment) for its environmental protection purposes and Article 194 (Energy) for minimising adverse effects on Union security of energy supply and the functioning of the internal energy market. CONTENT: the proposed regulation creates duties for operators, Member States and the Commission as follows. the Operator is to organise his activities around a best practice model; prepare a major hazards report (MHR) and to submit this to the competent authority for assessment. In addition, the Operator is to submit a notification for each well operation to the regulator; for both MHR's and well notifications, independent verification of the safety critical elements is required; Operators will prepare internal emergency response plans; promote interoperability and compatibility of response assets and report incidents and other specified information to the relevant Member State in a standard format; Union-based major companies would commit to demonstrating Union offshore safety standards wherever they work overseas. Member States: Member States licensing authorities would assess in an appropriate manner the potential safety and environmental performance (and financial capacity to deal with safety failures) of applicants when considering awards for exploration or production licenses. would establish competent authorities for supervision of safety, environmental protection and emergency preparedness and introduce robust standards for inspection and investigation, underpinned with appropriate penalties for breaches of duty by operators; will make information routinely available concerning their offshore sectors, and report all major incidents and lessons learned to the Commission; will prepare external emergency response plans, in collaboration with adjacent Member States. Measures will be taken to ensure interoperability of expertise and physical assets to support cross Union intervention including by EMSA. Member States and the industry will prepare and periodically test emergency response plans. Commission : the Commission is to establish an EU Offshore Authorities Group with representatives from the competent authorities responsible for offshore oil and gas activities in Union Member States. The Commission is to amend Environmental Liability Directive (2004/35/EC) within the regulation. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the budgetary implication of the proposal is approx EUR 2.5 million in the period 2013-2016, including compensations for committee participation. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that in a common area of freedom, security and justice, victims of (for example, domestic) violence or persons whose physical and/or psychological integrity or liberty is at risk and who benefit from a protection measure taken in one Member State should benefit from the same level of protection in other Member States should they move or travel, without going through expensive and time consuming procedures. This proposal is part of a legislative package which aims at strengthening the rights of victims in the EU and which also includes the following other elements: a communication on the strengthening of victims' rights in the EU; a directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. The European Union has already acted on the rights of victims in criminal proceedings through Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. Whilst improvements have been achieved on victims' rights, the objectives of the Council Framework decision have not been fully realised. In September 2009, 12 Member States put forward a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order. During the negotiations, it appeared that the mechanisms used in this instrument, based on Article 82 TFUE dealing with mutual recognition in criminal matters, is not compatible with the ambitious standard of mutual recognition already reached for civil matters, covered by Article 81 TFUE. In its resolution of 26 November 2009  on the elimination of violence against women the European Parliament calls on the Member States to improve their national laws and policies to combat all forms of violence against women and to act in order to tackle the causes of violence against women, not least by employing preventive measures and calls on the Union to guarantee the right to assistance, protection and support for all victims of violence. The present proposal therefore aims at completing a legal instrument on the mutual recognition of protection measures taken in criminal matters to ensure that all protection measures taken in a Member State benefit from an efficient mechanism to ensure their free circulation throughout the EU. Such action also replies to the Commission's call to further dismantle the obstacles to citizens' rights, set out in its Citizenship Report of 27 October 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission first hosted an experts' meeting on 25 May 2010 which confirmed that many Member State have put civil law protection measures in place, the mutual recognition of which should follow the common standards used in civil matters, rather than the more heavy procedures which are common standard in criminal matters. The European Commission also contracted an external Study to assist with the impact assessment in identifying the needs of victims of crime, which measures could be established to meet these needs and to examine the impacts of any possible options. The Commission held a public consultation from 15 July 2010 to 30 September 2010, open to all members of the public as well as to nongovernmental and governmental organisations asking their views on what action the EU should take to improve the situation of victims of crime, including in the field of protection orders. A further study was contracted to examine options in relation to the specific objective of ensuring that the protection gained through a protection order is not lost when a protected person travels or moves to another Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2)(a), (e) and (f) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: to protect victims of violence, in particular domestic violence, stalking or violence against children, the national laws of the Member States provide for the possibility to adopt temporary and preventative measures with a view to protecting a person when a serious risk exists to consider the persons physical and/or psychological integrity or liberty at risk. Protection measures are issued by a judicial or other authority upon request of the person at risk. Many of them are ordered without the person causing the risk being summoned to appear, in particular in case of urgency (""ex parte"" procedures). Protection measures are issued by a judicial or other authority upon request of the person at risk. Due to the increase of free movement more persons are moving or travelling abroad. Consequently, it is extremely important to ensure that such a temporary protection provided in one Member State is maintained when a person travels or moves to another Member State without having to go through time-consuming procedures. This proposal is a mutual recognition instrument in civil matters and as such it follows the rationale of existing EU instruments on judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters, from which it takes broad inspiration. More specifically, this proposal provides for a speedy and efficient mechanism to ensure that the Member State to which the person at risk moves will recognise the protection measure issued by the first Member State without any intermediate formalities. As for other mutual recognition instruments in civil matters, this proposal introduces a standardised certificate which contains all information relevant for the recognition and, where applicable, enforcement. Therefore, a certificate will be issued by the competent authority of the first Member State, either ex-officio or on request of the protected person, who will then contact the competent authorities in the second Member State and provide them with the certificate. The competent authorities of the second Member State will notify the person causing the risk about the geographical extension of the foreign protection measure, the sanctions applicable in case of its violation and, where applicable, ensure its enforcement. The proposal provides for the abolition of intermediate procedures and no grounds for refusal have been proposed, except for the existence of an irreconcilable decision in the Member State of recognition. Automatic recognition also applies when the Member State of recognition and/or enforcement does not have protection measures in civil matters. The abolition of intermediate procedures will be accompanied by fundamental rights safeguards: the authority of the first Member State which will be requested to issue the certificate will have to check that the right to a fair trial, in particular the right of defence, of the person causing the risk has been respected. In case such rights have not been guaranteed, the certificate cannot be issued; in case of suspension of withdrawal of the protection measure by the first Member State, the competent authority of the second Member State has, at request of the person causing the risk, to suspend or withdraw its recognition and, when applied, enforcement; the competent authorities of both Member States have to bring to the notice of the person causing the risk and to the protected person any information related to the issuing, recognition, possible enforcement and sanctions, suspension or withdrawal of the protection measure. The proposal does not deal with criminal sanctions put in place by Member States in case of violation of a protection measure. This question will continue to be dealt with by the national law of each Member State. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal relating to the making available on the market of pyrotechnic articles is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2007/23/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts. The proposal does not change the scope of the Directive and the essential safety requirements (apart from one point). The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the pyrotechnic articles are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the pyrotechnic article bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2007/23/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2007/23/EC on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their pyrotechnic articles comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant pyrotechnic article is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Generalised Scheme of Tariff Preferences (GSP scheme) is part of the European Union's common commercial policy, in accordance with the general provisions governing the European Union's external action. Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 applying the current GSP scheme provides that the preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation may be withdrawn temporarily, in respect of all or of certain products originating in a beneficiary country, for the serious and systematic violation of principles laid down in fifteen out of the twenty-seven international conventions listed in its Annex, on the basis of the conclusions of the relevant monitoring bodies. The relevant conventions also cover core labour rights such as forced labour. Myanmar/Burma's access to the GSP tariff preferences was temporarily withdrawn by Council Regulation (EC) No 552/97 due to routine and widespread practice of forced labour, confirmed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in a special procedure of its Commission of Inquiry. Since 2011, Myanmar/Burma has been undertaking a historic programme of openness and reform and the Council is now in favour of ""reinstating the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for Myanmar/Burma as soon as possible once the required conditions are fulfilled, following the assessment of the International Labour Organisation"". On 13 June 2012, the International Labour Conference (ILC) lifted restrictions, which excluded the Government of Myanmar/Burma from receiving ILO technical cooperation and assistance. Accordingly, the violations cannot be any longer considered as ""serious and systematic"" and thus the tariff preferences should be reinstated according to the current GSP Regulation. For these reasons, it is recommended that Myanmar/Burma’s access to generalized tariff preferences should be reinstated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, it is envisaged to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 552/97 for the reasons described above. It should be noted that in the absence of explicit reinstatement provisions in the current GSP Regulation, and in light of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, the ordinary legislative procedure is applied for the adoption of the reinstatement of preferences for Myanmar. This is a one-off procedure aimed at responding to a clear and present political need as expeditiously as possible. The new GSP Regulation which will apply only as of 1 January 2014 redresses the absence of reinstatement provisions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation does not incur costs to the EU budget and its application entails a very limited loss of customs revenue. The actual loss of customs revenue resulting from reintegration of Myanmar/Burma is estimated at less than €5 million and is due to a structural lack of production and trading capacity in the country."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he proposal repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial movements of pet animals into a Member State from another Member State or from third countries and the checks applicable to such movements. It aims to ensure a sufficient level of safety with regard to the public or animal health risks involved in those non-commercial movements and to remove any unjustified obstacles to such movements. (1) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 was substantially amended by Regulation (EU) No 438/2010 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals, in particular to extend the transitional regime provided for in Articles 6, 8 and 16 until 31 December 2011. In a statement annexed to Regulation (EU) No 438/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, the Commission undertook to propose a revision of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 in its entirety, and, in particular, the aspects of delegated and implementing acts. Therefore, due to the entry into force of the Treaty, the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 need to be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 of that Treaty. (2) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 also provides that as of 3 July 2011, i.e. the end of the eight-year transitional period provided for in Article 4(1) thereof, electronic identification is the only means of identifying a pet dog, cat or ferret. However, an animal bearing a clearly readable tattoo applied before that date continues to be considered identified in accordance with the Regulation. Because of the expiry of the aforementioned transitional regime and period and the need to make a number of amendments bringing the animal health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 into line with the TFEU in a sufficiently clear and accessible manner for the ordinary citizen, that Regulation should be repealed and replaced by this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and the introductory phrase and point (b) of Article 168(4) of the Treaty of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of the proposal is to repeal and replace Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by the proposed Regulation, which: aligns the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU; clarifies for the ordinary citizen the regime that will apply after the end of the transitional regime provided for in Articles 6, 8 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 and of the transitional period provided for in Article 4(1). This proposal and the proposal amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC which relates to trade in and imports of dogs, cats and ferrets should be presented together in order to be adopted simultaneously. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to amend Council Directive 92/65/EEC laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC. (1) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down inter alia the animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Union of dogs, cats and ferrets. Those requirements refer to the relevant animal health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC. The repeal of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by a new Regulation on the non-commercial movement of pet animals makes it necessary to amend Directive 92/65/EEC in order to delete and replace the references to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by references to the new Regulation. (2) In addition, Directive 92/65/EEC should also be amended to take account of the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97, which applies to the transport of dogs, cats and ferrets carried out within the Union. Moreover, experience in the application of Directive 92/65/EEC has shown that operators find it difficult to comply with the requirement laid down in that Directive that a clinical examination is carried out on animals 24 hours before their dispatch. The recommendations of the World Organisation for Animal Health for imports of dogs and cats provide for a clinical examination to be carried out 48 hours before shipment of the animals. It is therefore appropriate to extend the time limit laid down in Directive 92/65/EEC to 48 hours and to amend that Directive accordingly. This proposal and the proposal replacing and repealing Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 are presented together in order to be adopted simultaneously. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: · powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) TFEU (delegated acts); · and on the other hand, powers conferred on the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts, as laid down in Article 291(2) TFEU (implementing acts). Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 stipulates that if it appears in the light of scientific advice that the fishing mortality rates and associated spawning stock biomass levels used for the purposes of the plan are no longer appropriate, the Council must revise such parameters so as to ensure that the plan can attain its management objectives. The Regulation currently in force confers the power to amend these non-essential elements of the plan on the Council. Such a decision-making procedure is no longer possible under the TFEU. The powers conferred on the Commission by Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 must therefore be classified as delegated or implementing measures. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for interested parties to be consulted or for an impact assessment to be carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the main thrust of the proposal is to identify the powers conferred on the Commission by Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and to classify them as delegated or implementing powers. In order to amend or supplement non-essential elements of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty is delegated to the Commission in respect of the following: · changes to the established values for the maximum fishing mortality rates and associated spawning stock biomass levels, when the target fishing mortality rate has been reached; · the rules concerning: (i) the adjustment of the fishing effort where a group of vessels is excluded from or re-included in the effort regime; (ii) the method for calculating the fishing capacity and the adjustment of the maximum capacity levels due to permanent cessation of fishing activities and capacity transfers; (iii) the calculation method for adapting the maximum allowable fishing effort; and (iv) changes to the composition of the geographical areas and gear groupings. Furthermore, implementing powers are conferred on the Commission in respect of detailed rules on the procedure and format for transmitting the information required to the Commission, and the format of the special fishing permit and of the list of vessels holding such special permit. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the aim of this proposal is to amend Directive 2004/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields). In 2006, the medical community informed the Commission of its concerns regarding the implementation of this Directive, claiming that the exposure limit values laid down therein would limit to a disproportionate extent the use and development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), considered today to be a vital tool for the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases. Subsequently, other industrial sectors also expressed their concerns about the impact of the Directive on their activities. In response to these concerns, the Commission has taken a number of measures. In particular, it asked the Member States to inform it of any difficulties associated with implementation of the Directive and launched a study to assess the actual impact of the Directive on medical procedures using MRI. Meanwhile, in order to: allow a full analysis of the studies; take into account the results of the review of the new International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) recommendations and finally, conduct an in-depth impact analysis of the Directive’s provisions, the deadline for transposition was put back from 30 April 2008 to 30 April 2012. MRI issue : during the discussions preceding its adoption, the specific case of medical resonance imaging was discussed in detail by both the Council and the European Parliament. In the absence of any evidence of an undesirable impact, the joint legislators adopted the Directive, with certain amendments to the values originally proposed by the Commission, in particular not setting an exposure limit value for static magnetic fields, an essential component of MRI, because this value was being amended in the light of the latest scientific findings, which appeared as the Directive was being adopted. This proposal maintains a number of important principles and provisions in the present Directive, such as: the exposure limit values and action values for electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 300 GHz; provisions aimed at avoiding or reducing risk; medical surveillance, etc. The most important changes introduced by the proposal, taking into account the latest scientific findings in this area, are the following: clearer definitions, in particular for adverse health effects (Article 2 of Directive 2004/40/EC); inclusion of a revised system for limit and reference values different from the current limit values and action values for the range from 0 to 100 kHz (this will affect Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2004/40/EC plus its annex); introduction of indicators to facilitate measurements and calculations; introduction of limited but appropriate flexibility by proposing a controlled framework for limited derogations for industry; special attention to the specific case of medical applications using magnetic resonance and related activities. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: from discussions and consultations with stakeholders, the following options emerged: Policy option A: ‘Do nothing’ . Policy option B: ‘New Directive with revised exposure limits’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by a new Directive with revised exposure limit values that are higher than the previous ones, but are in line with scientific evidence. Policy option C1: ‘New Directive with revised exposure limits and partial exemptions’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by a new Directive with revised exposure limit values higher than the previous ones, but in line with scientific evidence (as in option B). In addition, conditional exemptions are provided for MRI, which will however remain subject to the general EMF risk management requirements and covered by the new Directive. Policy option C2: ‘New Directive with revised exposure limits and complete exemption for MRI’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by a new Directive with revised exposure limit values higher than the previous ones, but in line with scientific evidence (as in option B). Medical MRI will be exempted entirely from all the requirements of the EMF Directive. Policy option D1: ‘Replacement of the Directive by a Recommendation’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by non-binding occupational EMF exposure recommendations, based on the latest international recommendations. The form of these recommendations would be similar to the Council Recommendation on EMF exposure of the general public (1999/519/EEC). Policy option D2: ‘Voluntary agreements between the social partners’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by voluntary agreements at European or sectoral level between social partners in accordance with Article 154(4) TFEU. Policy option E: ‘No EU legislation’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is repealed while Directive 89/391/EEC (Framework Directive) and existing national regulatory provisions on the subject remain in force. The absence of national regulations in some Member States will allow unregulated occupational EMF exposures. For this option, it may be assumed that for example those countries which have already (partially) implemented the EMF Directive would not repeal their EMF legislation. The current proposal is in line with Option C1. C1 is also acceptable for a large majority of stakeholders. The compliance costs are higher than for option E but lower than for option A, which will be the situation as from 1 May 2012 if Directive 2004/40/EC remains in force. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends the relevant articles and annexes of Directive 2004/40/EC in order to achieve a clear, simple and precise text, which is transparent and readily understandable to the public and economic operators. This proposal maintains a number of important principles and provisions in the present Directive, such as: coverage of all sectors of activity , exposure limit values and action values for electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 300 GHz, provisions aimed at avoiding or reducing risk, information and training of workers, consultation and participation of workers, The most important changes introduced by the proposal, taking into account the latest scientific findings in this area, are the following: Clearer definitions, in particular for adverse health effects : a new Article 2 defines ‘electromagnetic fields’, ‘exposure limit values’ and ‘action values’, as was the case in Directive 2004/40/EC. The new article also defines the ‘orientation values’ introduced in the proposal and ‘adverse health effects’ and 'adverse safety effects' for the sake of clarification. Revised system for limit and reference values : the new Directive shall include a revised system for limit and reference values different from the current limit values and action values for the range from 0 to 100 kHz. In addition: Article 3 refers to the exposure limit values and action values as in Directive 2004/40/EC. However, paragraph 1 briefly sets out the roles of the new orientation and action values in order to achieve the proportionality required by stakeholders. This applies to the frequency range from 0 Hz to 100 kHz. From 100 kHz to 300GHz, the levels remain the same as in Directive 2004/40/EC, as no new recommendations have been published since 1998. Paragraph 3 is similar to the corresponding paragraph of Directive 2004/40/EC but has been adapted to limit extensive measurements to cases where they are really necessary. This will in practice simplify the carrying out of the risk assessment for a large majority of workplaces. Paragraph 4 is new and provides an exemption from the exposure limits for the medical MRI sector and related activities, which will continue to be subject to all other obligations. Paragraph 5 is new and provides the right for the military to use a protection system adapted to its specific working situations (e.g. radars). This request was made by NATO, which uses a protection system based on recommendations proposed by IEEE. This system can be considered equivalent to the system set out in this proposal. Paragraph 6 is new and provides for temporary derogations under controlled conditions where the exposure limits are likely to be exceeded. Health surveillance : Article 8 has been amended to introduce a distinction between exposure in the low frequency range (0 Hz to 100 kHz) and exposure in the high frequency range. The change takes into account the fact, confirmed by medical experts, that effects induced by low frequency fields cannot be observed once the worker has left the area of undesired exposure. Any health damage resulting from such exposure therefore cannot be determined by a medical examination. Technical amendments : compared with the same article (Article 10) in Directive 2004/40/EC, significant changes have been introduced. The first paragraph, containing a reference to the legislative procedure laid down in Article 153(2) with regard to the adoption of modifications of the exposure limit values, has been deleted since the proposal itself is based on Article 153(2) of the Treaty and it is not necessary to refer to it again in the enacting terms. The European Parliament and the Council do not empower the Commission to modify the exposure limit values. Any such modifications would therefore not be introduced by the Commission delegated acts but by amendments of the Directive according to the procedure laid down in Article 153(2) TFEU. However, the actual directly measurable reference levels, i.e. the orientation and action values, are considered as amendments of a strictly technical nature. In the light of the new ‘comitology’ rules introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, the purely technical amendments to Annexes referred to in Article 10 are measures of general scope that are designed to amend non-essential elements of the Directive. They thus come under ‘delegated acts’ within the meaning of Article 290 TFEU, and the procedure laid down in that Article (on delegating powers) should be used to adopt those technical amendments. Provision for complementary non-binding measures such as a non-binding practical guide : Article 13 is new and refers to the need to establish a practical guide in order to facilitate implementation of the Directive. Other measures : the proposed revised Directive aims to: introduce some guidance to ensure simplified but more efficient risk assessments in order to facilitate the evaluation work and also to limit the burden on SMEs, introduce limited but appropriate flexibility by proposing a controlled framework for limited derogations for industry. Annexes : Annex I introduces a number of physical quantities not included in the main text (Article 2). This option is considered preferable for better coherence of the text of the proposal. Annex II is an important part of the proposal because it sets out all the elements required to ensure more flexibility and proportionality in the frequency range from 0 Hz to 100 kHz. It introduces in practice the ‘zoning’ system supported by most stakeholders together with measures to facilitate risk assessment procedures whenever possible. Annex III covers the higher end of the frequency spectrum. As there have been no new international recommendations over recent years in this area, the changes are limited to a different presentation and some elements to facilitate the work of employers. Annex IV is specific to medical magnetic resonance (MR). It is designed to ensure the smooth and harmonised application of appropriate qualitative protection measures in a controlled environment. Annex V includes a list of legislative acts amending Directive 2004/40/EC (referred to in Article 15) and a correlation table between the provisions of Directive 2004/40/EC, as amended, and this proposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget except for the meetings of the proposed committees. The appropriations will be taken from the existing budget lines as is usually done for the functioning of the Advisory Committee for Safety and Health at Work (PROGRESS administrative line) and for the invitation of experts (general line). DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in order to empower it to make purely technical amendments of the Annexes to this Directive, in line with the adoption of directives in the field of technical harmonisation and standardisation and as a result of the technical progress, changes in the most relevant harmonised European standards or specifications and new scientific findings concerning electromagnetic fields, as well as to adjust the orientation and action values and the related lists of activities, workplaces and types of equipments. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. In exceptional cases, where imperative grounds of urgency so require, such as possible imminent risks to workers' health and safety arising from their exposure to electromagnetic fields, the possibility should be given to apply the urgency procedure to delegated acts adopted by the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: the scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008, carried out in 2011, stated that the cod plan has not achieved its objectives and that they are unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Furthermore, the report revealed that there are flaws in the design of the Regulation and problems with its implementation. The Commission is proposing an amendment to the Regulation in the light of this advice and of the opinions received from Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and the Member States. The proposal for the amendment of the Regulation does not cover all the problems identified since this amendment is intended as an interim solution pending the development and implementation of a mixed-fishery plan for North Sea fisheries as anticipated in the reform. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal was drawn up on the basis of consultations with the Member States and stakeholders. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENTS: the main legal action is as far as possible to improve and clarify the provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 that were identified in the evaluation as problematic, in particular: ·  the changes to Article 4 (Calculation of fishing effort) aim at closing the unintended possibility for Member States to deploy higher levels of effort than the plan was meant to allow simply by changing the methods used for the calculation of effort when establishing the baselines and when calculating usage; ·  Article 9 (Special procedure for setting TACs) defines a procedure for TAC setting in the absence of the necessary information to apply Article 7 or 8. Instead of automatic reductions of 25% it is proposed to take a case-by-case, and therefore a more flexible, approach though remaining firmly based on available scientific advice; ·  instead of exempting groups of vessels specified by each Member State, exemptions are now based on criteria that would be generally applicable for any vessels that meet them, regardless of the Member State to which they belong. The amended Article also avoids the need for constant adjustments of the baseline by Council; ·  transitional measures will ensure that vessels groups already excluded will be subject to the criteria in force at the time of exclusion; ·  vessels involved in the fully documented fishery trials , where all catches are counted against quota, are exempted from fishing effort regime; ·  a new proposal foresees the possibility for the Council to decide not to apply further fishing effort reductions, once the fishing-effort ceiling has been reduced for four consecutive years; ·  it is now made clear that the condition that cod catch are less than 5 % of the total refers to the catch composition over the management period, not per trip; ·  in Article 14, the Member State obligation to address the discard issue is strengthened since it is not the case under the current ruling, and level of control and monitoring is specified according to risk-based management; ·  the Committee procedure is brought into line with the rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: as announced in the Policy Plan on Asylum, this proposal is part of a first package of proposals which aim to ensure a higher degree of harmonisation and better standards of protection for the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). It is adopted at the same time as the recast of the Dublin Regulation and the Reception Conditions Directive. EURODAC, a Community-wide information technology system, was created to facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention. The Convention was replaced by a Community law instrument Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (""the Dublin Regulation""). EURODAC allows Member States to determine whether an asylum applicant or a foreign national illegally present in a Member State has previously applied for asylum in another Member State . Among other criteria, the Dublin Regulation allocates responsibility for the assessment of an asylum claim on the basis of which Member State allowed the applicant to the territory of the Member States. EURODAC allows Member States to verify whether the asylum-seeker was previously apprehended when crossing irregularly the border of a Member State coming from a third country. The EURODAC Regulation lays down strictly defined and harmonised rules regarding the storage, comparison and erasure of fingerprints, while it also provides for data protection and data security safeguards. It provides for the implementation of a Central Unit (CU) managed by the European Commission containing an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). Fingerprints taken by Member States are sent to this system which indicates whether the same fingerprints are already stored in the database and if this is the case, which Member State sent them in. In addition to fingerprints, the central database also keeps record of the place and date of the application for asylum, the Member State which entered the data and its reference number, the gender of the applicant, the date on which the fingerprints were taken and when they were transmitted to the CU. These data are collected for any asylum applicant and any third country national or stateless person apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border at least 14 years of age. The data can be kept for up to 10 years and up to 2 years respectively, unless the individual obtains the citizenship of one of the Member States, receives a residence permit or leaves the territory of the Member States (at which point the data is erased). In its evaluation report, the Commission acknowledged that the Regulation is applied in a generally satisfactory way, but identified certain issues related to the efficiency of the current legislative provisions which have to be tackled in order to improve EURODAC's support of the Dublin Regulation. These include the continuing late transmission of fingerprints by a number of Member States; inefficient management of data deletions; unclear specification of national authorities having access to EURODAC, which hinders the monitoring role of the Commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS); and the fact that that some persons already granted asylum in a Member State nevertheless apply again in another. Regarding the more efficient use of the EURODAC database, the proposal aims to: establish rules to ensure truly prompt transmission of fingerprints to the Central Unit of EURODAC in order to ensure that the Member State responsible under the Dublin Regulation for examining the application is correctly identified; update and clarify definitions of the different stages of management of the database, also in line with the objective to house all large-scale IT systems under Title IV of the TEC in one location under one management and running on the same platform (enabling to improve productivity and reduce operational costs); to unblock data on recognised refugees and to make them searchable by national asylum authorities, in order to avoid a situation where recognised refugee in one Member State applies for protection in another Member State . Regarding data protection concerns, the proposal aims to: establish technical rules to ensure that Member States delete data which is no longer necessary for the purpose for which were collected and to ensure that Commission can better monitor the respect of the data protection principles; clarify the provisions ensuring effective monitoring by the Commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) of access to data in EURODAC by national authorities. Since it has not been used, the Commission proposes to abolish the committee provided for by the Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : the European Council of 23-24 June requested a mechanism to respond to truly critical situations regarding Member States’ borders. This requires the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code established by Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 which lays down, on the one hand, the rules on border control at the external borders and, on the other hand, provides for the abolition of border control at internal borders and the possibility for its reintroduction in limited cases. Since the free movement of persons within the area without internal borders is a key Union achievement, the benefits of which are enjoyed by all the persons living in this area, it should require a decision to be taken at the Union level if this free movement is liable to be affected by a unilateral and sometimes opaque national decision. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 77 (1) and (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : this proposal amends Regulation (EC) No 562/2006, and sets out the general framework for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders as well as the criteria for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: General framework for reintroduction of border controls : where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, border control at internal borders may exceptionally be reintroduced at all or specific parts of the internal borders of one or several Member States for a limited period of no more than 30 days or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat if its duration exceeds the period of 30 days. This period may be extended under certain conditions, but shall not exceed six months. However, in cases of persistent serious deficiencies related to external border control or return procedures, the Commission can decide to extend this period. Criteria for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders: when making a decision on such a reintroduction, the Commission or the Member State concerned shall assess the extent to which such a measure is likely adequately to remedy the threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, and shall assess the proportionality of the measure to that threat. In making such an assessment, the following considerations shall in particular be taken into account: the likely impact of any threats to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, including following terrorist incidents or threats as well as threats posed by organised crime; the availability of technical or financial support measures which could be or have been resorted to at the national and/or European level, including assistance by Union bodies such as Frontex, the EASO or Europol, and the extent to which such measures are likely to adequately remedy the threats to public policy or internal security; the impact of any serious deficiencies related to external border control or return procedures identified by Schengen evaluations in accordance with the Regulation on the establishment of an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis; the likely impact of such a measure on free movement within the area without internal border controls. Before taking a decision, the Commission may request further information from Member States, Frontex, Europol, Eurojust, the Fundamental Rights Agency or any other Union body, and may also carry out inspection visits. Procedure for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders: the Member State concerned shall submit a request to the Commission at the latest six weeks before the planned reintroduction, or within a shorter period where the circumstances giving rise to the need to reintroduce border control at internal borders do not become known until less than six weeks before the planned reintroduction, and shall supply the following information to the Commission, Member States and the European Parliament: the reasons for the proposed reintroduction, including all relevant data detailing the events that constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level; the scope of the proposed reintroduction, specifying at which part of the internal borders border control is to be reintroduced; the names of the authorised crossing-points; the date and duration of the proposed reintroduction; where appropriate, the measures to be taken by the other Member States. Such a request could also be submitted jointly by two or more Member States. The Commission shall decide on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders through implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure and will also decide on their prolongation. Specific procedure for cases requiring immediate action : where a serious threat to public policy or internal security in a Member State demands immediate action, the Member State concerned may exceptionally and immediately reintroduce border control at internal borders, for a limited period of no more than five days, andnotify the other Member States and the Commission accordingly, supplying the necessary information and the reasons that justify the use of this procedure. If the serious threat to public policy or internal national security persists beyond 5 days, the Commission shall decide on the prolongation of the border control at internal borders. Specific procedure for cases of persistent serious deficiencies : where the Commission finds that there are persistent serious deficiencies related to external border control or return procedures and insofar as these deficiencies constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, border control at internal borders may be reintroduced for a period of no more than six months, which may be prolonged by a further period of no more than six months if the serious deficiencies are not remedied, up to three such prolongations. The Commission shall decide on the re-introduction of border control at internal borders, as well as any prolongation, The Commission and the Member State(s) concerned shall inform the European Parliament and the Council as soon as possible of any reasons which might trigger the application of these provisions. Report : at the latest four weeks after the lifting of border control at internal borders, the Member State which has carried out border control at internal borders shall present a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders, outlining, in particular, the operation of the checks and the effectiveness of the reintroduction of border control at internal borders. Informing the public : the Commission shall inform the public on a decision to reintroduce border control at internal borders and indicate in particular the start and end date of such a measure, unless there are overriding security reasons for not doing so."" BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the preparation of financial statements has been identified as one of the most burdensome regulatory obligations for companies. Small companies face proportionally higher administrative burdens in comparison to medium-sized/large companies. On 18 December 2008, the European Parliament adopted a non-legislative Resolution on accounting requirements as regards small and medium-sized companies, particularly micro-entities, stating that Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (‘the Accounting Directives’) are often very burdensome for small and medium-sized companies, and in particular for micro-entities, and asking the Commission to continue its efforts to review those Directives. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish at a Union level minimum equivalent legal requirements as regards the extent of the financial information that should be made available to the public by undertakings that are in competition with one another. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : broadly, the Impact Assessment looked at two issues: Financial Statements : five broad policy options were examined, starting from the baseline scenario. The broad option of revising and modernising selected requirements currently in the Accounting Directives was finally retained as the preferred option. After examining more detailed options, it appeared that a ""mini-regime"" specific to small companies would be the best policy choice. The potential for administrative burden reduction of this policy amounts to EUR 1.5 bn which arises from reduced reporting requirements in the notes, further relaxation of statutory audit and the exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements for small groups. A second detailed option concerned the increase of the thresholds for small and medium-sized companies. The burden reduction potential of this proposal amounts to around EUR 0.2 billion. The estimated potential for savings is therefore estimated at EUR 1.7 bn overall. Micro-companies will in any event benefit from the simplified regime offered to small companies. However, the impact on micro-entities of the above policy choices has been disregarded as the proposal for a Directive on micro-entities that is pending before the European Parliament and the Council specifically addresses these. Reporting of payments to governments : the Impact Assessment analysed five broad policy options starting from the baseline scenario (policy option 0), next examining possible schemes that would result in a global agreement for country-by-country reporting for EU and non-EU MNCs (policy option 1), and lastly assessing several policy options that would oblige only EU companies to disclose country by country information (policy options 2 to 4). Whilst policy option 2 requires the disclosure of payments to governments on a country basis from the extractive industry and the loggers of primary forests, policy option 3 requires the disclosure of such information on a country- and project- basis. In addition to a report on payments to government, policy option 4 would require a complete set of country-by-country accounts to be prepared by companies active in the extractive industry and loggers of primary forests. The option of requiring country-by-country reporting (CBCR) of payments to government on a country-and-project basis by EU Multinational Companies (MNCs) in the extractive industry and logging of primary forests (policy option 3) was retained. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50(1) TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal introduces certain key provisions. A specific regime for small companies : this will considerably reduce the administrative burden currently borne by small companies when they prepare their financial statements. It will limit disclosures by way of notes to the accounts to (i) accounting policies; (ii) guarantees, commitments, contingencies and arrangements that are not recognised in the balance sheet; (iii) post-balance sheet events not recognised in the balance sheet; (iv) long-term and secured debts; and (v) related party transactions. It should be noted that mandating the disclosure of items (iii) and (v) will result in new obligations imposed for small companies, as a majority of Member States have provided for exemptions from these disclosures for such companies. Harmonise thresholds : the proposal also seeks to harmonise thresholds to ensure that the administrative burden reduction actually reaches all small companies in the EU. Currently many companies that are small under EU definitions enter the medium-sized or large company category because the definitions in the Directives are lower when transposed at Member State level. Small companies : the main measures are as follows: ·  maximum harmonisation will ensure that companies of the same size benefit from a level playing field across the EU; ·  notes to the accounts will be limited to only five key areas; ·  no requirement for a statutory audit; ·  small groups will be exempt from preparing consolidated financial statements Medium and large companies : the proposal seeks to improve the comparability and clarity of financial statements prepared by medium-sized and large companies, and by small companies to a limited extent. To this end, it seeks to reduce the number of options currently available to Member States, insofar as these options are detrimental to the comparability of the financial statements. General principles such as ""substance over form"" will become mandatory so as to increase the clarity of financial statements. Reporting of payments to governments : in order to promote governments' accountability and good governance, the proposal introduces new reporting requirements for companies active in the extractive industry or in the logging of primary forests. It is proposed that companies shall disclose the payments they make to governments in each country where they operate and for each project, where the payment has been attributed to a certain project and when material to the recipient government. In line with the overall objective and in order to limit the additional administrative burden, the new requirement is limited to large companies and public interest entities. Proposed Directive and repeal of existing legislation : the proposal will repeal the Accounting Directives. Micro-entities : it should be noted that the proposal complements the proposal for a Directive on the financial statements of micro-entities which is currently still being negotiated by the EU co-legislators. Given that the Council and the Parliament have now both agreed to the principle of a micro entity regime, the current proposal does not contain any new policy proposal regarding micro companies as assessed in the Impact Assessment. The Commission is willing to consider, together with the EU co-legislators, how best to integrate into the current proposal the final inter-institutional agreement on the Directive of 2009. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission’s report on the operation of the Transparency Directive shows that the transparency requirements of the Directive are considered to be useful for the proper and efficient functioning of the market by a majority of stakeholders. However, the review of the operation of the Transparency Directive also showed that there are areas where the regime it created could be improved. In particular, Improvement of the regulatory environment for small and medium-sized issuers and their access to capital are high political priorities for the Commission, as noted in the Single Market Act Communication of April 2011. It is thus desirable to provide for the simplification of certain issuers' obligations with a view to making regulated markets more attractive for small and medium-sized issuers raising capital in Europe. Additionally, the legal clarity and effectiveness of the existing transparency regime needs to be increased, notably with respect to the disclosure of corporate ownership. Lastly, the Commission Communication on reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial services sector envisages EU legislative action to set minimum common standards on certain key issues of sanctioning regimes, to be adapted to the specifics of the different sectors. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. It sets out the best policy options which were retained in the proposal: (i) allow for more flexibility regarding the frequency and timing of publication of periodical financial information, in particular for small and medium-sized issuers : abolish the obligation to present quarterly financial reports for all listed companies. Introducing differentiated disclosure regimes for companies listed on a regulated market according to their size was considered undesirable as such a regime would introduce double standards for the same market segment and would therefore be confusing for investors. The preferred policy option reduces compliance costs for all companies listed on regulated markets but should in particular benefit the smaller ones, reducing considerably the administrative burden linked to the publication and preparation of quarterly information. This option: ·  enables the small and medium-sized issuers to redirect their resources to publish the kind of information that suits best their investors;  should reduce short term pressure on issuers and incentivise investors to adopt a longer term vision. It should not have negative impact on investor protection, which is already sufficiently guaranteed through the mandatory disclosure of half yearly and yearly financial results, as well as through the disclosures required by the Market Abuse and Prospectus Directives; (ii) simplify the narrative parts of financial reports for small and medium-sized issuers : require ESMA to prepare non binding guidance (templates) on narrative content of the financial reports for all listed companies. This option allows for cost savings and improves comparability of information for investors. It also increases the cross-border visibility of the small and medium-sized issuers; (iii) eliminate the gaps in requirements for notification concerning major holdings of voting rights: extend the disclosure regime to all instruments of similar economic effect to holding of shares and entitlements to acquire shares. This option captures cash settled derivatives as well as any future similar financial instruments and closes a gap in the existing disclosure regime. It has a strong positive impact on investor protection and market confidence as it discourages secret stock building in listed companies; (iv) eliminate divergences in notification requirements for major holdings : harmonise the regime for the disclosure of major holdings of voting rights by requiring the aggregation of holdings of shares with those of financial instruments giving access to shares (including the cash settled derivatives). This option creates a uniform approach, reduces legal uncertainty, enhances transparency, simplifies cross-border investments and reduces its costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 and Article 114. CONTENT: the proposal contains the following provisions: Choice of the home Member State for third country issuers : the Transparency Directive is currently unclear with regard to which country is the home Member State for issuers who have to choose their home Member State but who have not done so. It is important that the Transparency Directive does not provide for any possibility to implement the rules in such a way that a listed company can operate without being under the supervision of any Member State. Therefore, a default home Member State is established for third country issuers who have not chosen their home Member State in accordance with Article 2(1) (i) during a period of three months. The requirement to publish interim management statements and/ or quarterly reports is abolished for all listed companies . The publication of such information is not considered necessary for investor protection and should therefore be left to the market in order to eliminate unnecessary administrative burden. For the sake of efficiency and in order to provide for a harmonised regime for disclosure, Member States should not continue to impose such an obligation in their national legislation. Currently, many Member States impose stricter disclosure requirements than the minimum foreseen in the Directive. In order to ensure that all listed companies in the EU benefit from equal treatment and that the administrative burden is effectively reduced, Member States should be prevented from gold plating and should not require more than what is necessary for investor protection. Broad definition of financial instruments subject to notification requirement . In order to take account of financial innovation and ensure that issuers and investors have full knowledge of the structure of corporate ownership, the definition of financial instrument should be broadened to cover all instruments of similar economic effect to holdings of shares and entitlements to acquire shares, whether giving right to a physical settlement or not. Currently, the Transparency Directive does not require notification of certain types of financial instruments that do not give the right to acquire voting rights, but which can be used to build secret stakes in listed companies without being disclosed to the market. Greater harmonisation for notification of major holdings - aggregation of holdings of shares with holdings of financial instruments . The Transparency Directive does not require aggregation of holdings of voting rights with holdings of financial instruments to calculate the thresholds for notification of major holdings. Member States have adopted different approaches in this field, resulting in a fragmented market and additional costs for cross-border investors. Holdings of shares need to be aggregated with the holdings of financial instruments for the calculation of notification thresholds. Netting of long and short positions should not be allowed. The notification should include the breakdown by type of financial instruments held to provide the market with detailed information on the nature of the holdings. However, in order to take into account the differences in ownership concentration, Member States should continue to be allowed to set lower national thresholds for notification of major holdings than those provided in the Transparency Directive where this is necessary to ensure appropriate transparency of holdings. Storage of regulated information : access to financial information on listed companies on a pan-European basis is currently burdensome. Interested parties need to go through 27 different national databases in order to search for information. In order to facilitate cross-border access to regulated information, the current network of officially appointed storage mechanisms should be enhanced. It is proposed that the Commission receives further delegated powers in this respect, in particular regarding the access to regulated information at the Union level. ESMA should assist the European Commission by developing draft regulatory technical standards concerning, for example, the operation of a central access point for the search of regulated information at the Union level. These measures should also be used to prepare the possible future creation of a single European storage mechanism ensuring storage of regulated information at the Union level. Reporting of payments to governments : the Commission has publicly expressed support for the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), and envisaged willingness to present legislation mandating disclosure requirements for extractive industry companies. Furthermore, the European Parliament has adopted a Resolution reiterating its support for country-by-country reporting requirements, in particular for the extractive industries. EU legislation does not currently require issuers to disclose, on a country basis, payments to governments made in countries where they operate. In order to make governments accountable for the use of these resources and promote good governance, it is proposed to require the disclosure of payments to governments at the individual or consolidated level of a company. The Transparency Directive requires issuers to disclose payments to governments by referring to the relevant provisions of Directive 2011/../EU Council on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings which provides for the detailed requirements in this respect. This proposal is comparable to the US Dodd-Frank Act, which was adopted in July 2010, and requires extractive industry companies (oil, gas and mining companies) registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to publicly report payments to government son a country- and project-specific basis. Sanctions and investigation : the sanctioning powers of competent authorities are enhanced. In particular, the publication of sanctions is important to improve transparency and to maintain confidence in the financial markets. Sanctions should normally be published, except in certain well-defined circumstances. In addition, the competent authorities in the Member States should have the power to suspend the exercise of voting rights of the issuer who had breached the notification rules on major holdings, as this is the most efficient sanction to prevent a breach of these rules. In order to ensure consistent application of sanctions, uniform criteria should be set for determining the actual sanction applicable to a person or a company. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure for the 2014 draft budget showed the need to reduce the total amount of direct payments that can be granted to farmers in respect of calendar year 2013 by EUR 1 471.4 million through financial discipline, in order to respect the EAGF net ceiling for financial year 2014 and establish the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector (EUR 424.5 million). As a consequence, the level of direct payments should be reduced in order to comply with the ceiling. On this basis, the Commission presents a proposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013, which must be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2013 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. However, if this adjustment rate has not been set by 30 June 2013, the Commission will set that rate pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal implements the rules provided for in Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. Prior consultation with the interested parties and the preparation of an impact assessment were not needed. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT : the draft regulation provides that the amounts of direct payments within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 5000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2013 shall be reduced by 4.981759 %. The reduction provided for shall not apply in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. The unequal distribution of direct payments between small and large beneficiaries remains a cause for concern for the Common Agricultural Policy. The draft regulation proposes to apply the financial discipline adjustment rate to amounts in excess of EUR 5000 in order to contribute to achieving the objective of a more balanced distribution of payments. This is in line with what is proposed on financial discipline in the context of the CAP reform, presented by the Commission in its proposal for a regulation establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial discipline adjustment rate of 4.981759 % has been calculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts in excess of EUR 5000 and not in all Member States. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2013 (financial year 2014). The total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 1471.4 million. The adjustment rate has been calculated taking into account the estimated share of direct payments to be granted to farmers below EUR 5000 for each direct payment scheme subject to financial discipline and for each Member State, except Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. Since direct payments in Bulgaria, Romania and in Croatia, subject to accession, are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2013, the financial discipline will not apply to them as a consequence. It should be noted that the final calculation of the financial discipline rate will depend on the sub-ceiling under Heading 2 set by the Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 and the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 October 2006, Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) entered into force. After four years of practical application, the need for a number of limited technical amendments has emerged. The main sources for these amendments are: practical experiences of the Member States and the Commission in the application of the Schengen Borders Code, including the results of Schengen evaluations and the reports and requests submitted by Member States; the Commission reporton the operation of the provisions on stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of the Schengen Borders Code and Commission report on the application of Title III (Internal Borders) of the Schengen Borders Code; consistency considerations linked to other recently adopted legislation, in particular the Visa Code (Regulation (EC) No 810/2009) and the Return Directive (Directive 2008/115/EC). This proposal contains amendments that improve clarity and narrow the scope for divergent interpretations of the existing text as well as amendments responding to practical problems that have arisen during the first years of the Schengen Borders Code. Furthermore it provides for an explicit legal framework for bilateral agreements related to joint border checks on road traffic. New policy initiatives, such as the creation of an EU Entry/Exit System and an EU Registered Traveller Programme, will be the subject of specific proposals to be discussed separately. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77(1) and 77(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The main proposed amendments concern the following issues: Definitions : the proposal provides a clear definition of the method for calculating ‘stays not exceeding three months per six month period’ (Article 5). Following the judgment delivered by the ECJ on 3 October 2006 in Case C-241/05, Bot, and the adoption of a related parallel provision in Article 2(2)(a) of the Visa Code, clarified and authentic legislative guidance on this issue is needed for the Schengen Borders Code. The definition of residence permit is also reshaped. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, it is made clear that visas (both long-stay and short-stay) can never be considered as ‘residence permits’ within the meaning of point 15(b). Duration of the validity of certain travel documents : a clarification is made concerning the required period of validity of travel documents of non-visa holders (Article 5), in response to practical needs and in order to align the text with Article 12 of the Visa Code. Creating separate lanes for certain travellers : the proposal foresees the possibility to create separate lanes for visa-free travellers (Article 9) in order to provide additional flexibility and speed up border control in accordance with practical needs. Stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals : the situation of train crews on international connections is comparable to pilots or seamen as these trains follow a fixed schedule. The Commission already announced that it would introduce an exemption from stamping for this category of persons. Border guard training : the proposal provides measures to improve training of border guards in order to detect situations of particular vulnerability involving unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking (Article 15). Rescue services : in order to allow for derogations related to the entry and exit of members of rescue services, police and fire brigades acting in emergency situations an express legal framework is required (addition of a new category in Article 19, accompanied by related provisions in Annex VII) including the possibility to conclude bilateral agreements on this issue. In addition, a special exemption is made for offshore workers (such as workers on oil-platforms or on maritime windparks) in Annex VII, point 8, providing for rules comparable to coastal fishing. Checks within the territory : many Member States do not implement Article 22 of the Schengen implementing Convention (reporting obligation for legally staying third-country nationals entering other Member States). Practical difficulties in verifying compliance with this general reporting obligation are broadly acknowledged and no convincing cost/benefit argument could be made to show that this rule has a significant impact on identifying illegally staying immigrants. The recent Commission report on the application of Title III (Internal Borders) of the Schengen Borders Code therefore proposed repealing Article 22 Schengen implementing Convention as well as the corresponding reference to it in Article 21(d) Schengen Borders Code. The proposed amendment does not affect the right of Member States to provide for targeted checks to fight illegal immigration in their territory. Delegated acts : in order to align the provisions of the Schengen Borders with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of additional measures governing surveillance as well as amendments to the annexes. Reporting obligations : alignment of reporting obligations, expressly obliging Member States to inform the Commission of all bilateral agreements authorised by the Schengen Borders Code. An explicit legal framework for joint border crossings (Annex VI) : in order to enable bilateral agreements to be concluded between Member States and neighbouring third countries on cooperation in border control with joint border crossing points, Annex VI of the Schengen Borders Code needs to be amended to expressly permit bilateral agreements for joint border checks on road traffic and to provide a legal framework on certain key issues, such as the situation of persons requesting international protection. Amendments to the Annexes : a number of technical amendments have been made to the Annexes. Repealing certain articles of the Convention : the rules relating to border checks have been harmonised by EU law. This affects the power of Member States to conclude treaties in this field. The conclusion of bilateral agreements between a Member State and a third country on border checks without specific permission to do so in the Schengen Borders Code would affect EU law within the meaning of Article 3(2) TFEU and Article 2(1) TFEU. Article 136 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement is incompatible with this principle. It should therefore be repealed It should be noted that throughout the text, a certain number of changes resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty are proposed (‘EU’ instead of ‘EC’). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: European Council Decision. BACKGROUND: Article 2(1) and (2) of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions will expire at the end of the 2009-2014 parliamentary term. It is necessary to comply without delay with the provisions of Article 2(3) of Protocol No 36 and therefore to adopt the decision provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union, in order to enable Member States to enact in good time the necessary domestic measures for organising the elections to the European Parliament for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term. The first subparagraph of Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union lays down the criteria for the composition of the European Parliament, namely: (i) that representatives of the Union's citizens are not to exceed 750, plus the President, (ii) that representation is to be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of 6 members per Member State, and (iii) that no Member State is to be allocated more than 96 seats. LEGAL BASIS: Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). CONTENT: by applying the principle of degressive proportionality provided for by the Treaty on European Union, it is proposed to establish the number of representatives in the European Parliament elected in each Member States for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term as follows: Belgium : 21 Bulgaria : 17 Czech Republic : 21 Denmark : 13 Germany : 96 Estonia : 6 Ireland : 11 Greece : 21 Spain : 54 France : 74 Croatia : 11 Italy : 73 Cyprus : 6 Latvia : 8 Lithuania : 11 Luxembourg : 6 Hungary : 21 Malta : 6 Netherlands : 26 Austria : 18 Poland : 51 Portugal : 21 Romania : 32 Slovenia : 8 Slovakia : 13 Finland : 13 Sweden : 20 United Kingdom : 73. It is proposed that this Decision shall be revised sufficiently far in advance of the beginning of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term on the basis of an initiative of the European Parliament presented before the end of 2016 with the aim of establishing a system which in future will make it possible, before each fresh election to the European Parliament, to allocate the seats between Member States in an objective, fair, durable and transparent way. The allocation should respect the principle of degressive proportionality, taking account of any change in their number and demographic trends in their population, as duly ascertained thus respecting the overall balance of the institutional system."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: public sector information is an important primary material for digital content products and services with a large hitherto unexploited potential. The economic importance of opening data resources, including public data, is now widely recognised. A recent study estimates the total market for public sector information in 2008 at € 28 billion across the Union. The same study indicates that the overall economic gains from further opening up public sector information by allowing easy access are around €40 billion a year for the EU27. The total direct and indirect economic gains from PSI applications and use across the whole EU27 economy would be in the order of €140 billion annually Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on the re-use of public sector information aims to facilitate the re-use of PSI throughout the Union by harmonising the basic conditions for reuse and removing major barriers to re-use in the internal market. The review was carried out by the Commission and resulted in the publication of Communication COM(2009) 212. It found that, despite the progress made, a number of barriers still persisted namely: · attempts by public sector bodies to maximise cost recovery, as opposed to benefits for the wider economy, competition between the public and the private sector; · practical issues hindering re-use, such as the lack of information on available PSI, and the mindset of public sector bodies failing to realise the economic potential. The Commission concluded that a further review should be carried out by 2012, when more evidence on the impact, effects and application of the Directive would be available. This proposal of the Commission is the result of the second review. The review of the Directive thus forms part of the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Europe 2020 strategy aiming for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined 5 options to deal with the identified problems, i.e. insufficient clarity and transparency of PSI re-use rules, locked information resources, excessive charges, lack of a level playing field, insufficient enforcement of re-use provisions, and inconsistent approaches adopted by individual Member States. Option 1: No policy change : no changes to the Directive (baseline); Option 2: Discontinuing existing Union action : repeal of the PSI Directive; Option 3: Soft law measures (e.g. Commission guidelines or recommendations); Option 4: Legislative amendments (amending the substance of the Directive, i.e. the rights and obligations established by its provisions); Option 5: Packaged solution combining substantive changes to the re-use framework (Option 4) with additional guidance on the principles to be applied by national authorities when they implement it at national level (Option 3). The Commission considers that combining legislative amendments with soft law measures (option 5) combines the benefits of option 3 and 4. This will hence ensure the convergence of national re-use friendly regulatory approaches throughout the internal market, thereby enhancing legal certainty, increasing incentives and lowering barriers to PSI re-use. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the overall aim of this revision is to eliminate persisting and emerging differences between Member States in the exploitation of public sector information, which hamper realisation of the full economic potential of this resource. Specific aims are to facilitate the creation of Union-wide products and services based on PSI, to ensure the effective cross-border use of PSI for value-added products and services, to limit distortions of competition on the Union market, and to prevent the deepening of disparities among Member States in dealing with reuse of PSI. The content of the proposal corresponds to those aims. This includes: extension of the scope of the Directive to currently excluded sectors (cultural, educational and research establishments as well as public service broadcasters); establishing a rule for charging based on marginal costs, possibly with exceptions; amending the general principle to make accessible documents re-usable; imposing a requirement to publish data in machine-readable formats; imposing a requirement to appoint an independent regulator and to provide for an effective and efficient redress mechanism; reversing the burden of proof of compliance with charging requirements; imposing a requirement to define the scope of ‘public task’ by legislative means only. The Commission should assist the Member States in implementing the Directive in a consistent way by giving guidance, particularly on charging and calculation of costs, on recommended licensing conditions and on formats, after consulting interested parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Staff Regulations constitute the legal framework for employment and working conditions for the approximately 55 000 officials and other agents employed by more than fifty institutions and agencies located in different places of employment in the European Union and in third countries. Recent events in the global economy as well as the subsequent need to consolidate public finances cannot fail to have an impact on the European civil service and the administrations of all EU institutions, bodies and agencies. In this context, it is important to take account of a certain number of elements weighing on the administrative budget, in particular: the upcoming retirements in EU institutions, which will mainly affect staff from the 15 Member States of the Union before 2004, it will be a particular challenge to maintain the geographical balance of all Member States among staff; the demographic changes in Europe, attracting and retaining excellent staff from all Member States will be even more difficult in the future. The main amendments concern in particular the method of calculation of pensions, given that the current system weighs heavily on the administrative budget. The Commission proposal strikes the balance between cost-efficiency and the needs of the institutions in the field of human resource management. The European Commission considers that, if this proposal is adopted, the EU institutions will continue to be assisted by an independent, efficient and modern European civil service that will allow them to fulfil the tasks which they have been entrusted with by the treaties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 336 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 12 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union. CONTENT: the main elements of the proposal are as follows : - reducing staff by 5% : it is proposed to reduce the staff of each institution and agency by 5%, and this would be done by not replacing a certain number of departures, i.e. those who retire and those whose contracts come to an end; - method for adjusting salaries and pensions : the new method would preserve the principle of parallelism between the evolution of salaries of national officials and that of the EU officials, and would address the shortcomings of the current method: the new method would reflect nominal salary changes (instead of real salary changes) in all Member States. In this way the method will precisely follow salary changes in all Member States of the European Union and not only in a limited sample; in order to reduce the time lag in an extraordinary situation, the new exception clause would be automatically applied in case two conditions are met: 1) a decrease in the EU's GDP, and 2) the gap between the adjustment value of the remuneration and pensions of EU staff and the change in the EU's GDP exceeds two percentage points. If both conditions are fulfilled, half of the adjustment value would be postponed to the next year. For instance, this clause would have been triggered in 2009; the Brussels International Index would be suppressed. The differences in the increase in the cost of living between each place of employment and that of the Member States would be calculated and reflected in correction coefficients. A new joint correction coefficient would be introduced for Belgium and Luxemburg, considering these Member States as a single place of employment. It will be fixed at 100 for the first year. - solidarity levy : since 1982, the method has been linked to an additional tax on salaries, due to the effects of the oil crisis. Despite the improvement in the economic situation, this additional tax has not been phased out, but has become a measure linked to the automatic application of the method. It is suggested that, for the duration of the proposed method, the solidarity levy be increased at the rate of 6%; - modifications to the pension system in order to keep pace with demographic developments : increasing the normal retirement age to 65 years : currently, the normal retirement age is 63 years for officials recruited after 1 May 2004. Officials recruited before 1 May 2004 are subject to transitional provisions according to which the retirement age varies from 60 years to 63 years. It is proposed to increase the normal retirement age for officials recruited as of 1 January 2013 at 65 years. Similar transitional rules as those applied in 2004 would be implemented, i.e. the retirement age of officials recruited before 1 May 2013 would vary from 60 to 65 years. Furthermore, it will no longer be only on an exceptional basis that the possibility to continue working until 67 years would be granted; raising the age for early retirement to 58 years and reducing the number of officials benefiting from early retirement : currently, the minimum early retirement age is set at 55 years. Under the new proposal, the minimum early retirement age would be set at 58 years. In addition, the maximum number of officials retiring in a given year without a reduction of their pension rights would be fixed at 5% of the officials in all institutions who retired during the previous year (as opposed to 10% in the current system). This scheme is maintained since it has proven useful for all institutions as a HR management tool in the course of the last enlargement exercise; aligning the methodology for calculating the pension contribution rate to international actuarial practice : the computation system for the pension contribution rate expires on 30 June 2013. It is proposed to keep the same methodology, but to increase the moving average for interest rates and salary growth to 30 years. A transitional period of eight years would apply. - adapting the conditions of employment : it is proposed to: introducing a minimum number of weekly working hours : the 5% staff cut would require that every staff member take a share of the additional work burden, if the same policy objectives are to be achieved. It is therefore proposed to introduce in the Staff Regulations a minimum number of working hours per week, i.e. 40. maintaining flexitime working-time arrangements : flexible working-time arrangements allow reconciling work and private life and facilitate suitable gender balance within the Institutions while respecting the mandatory working time obligations. It is therefore appropriate to introduce a clear reference to these arrangements in the Staff Regulations. - allowances and entitlements : staff members are currently entitled to a maximum of six days per year of travelling time to their place of origin. It is proposed to limit the annual travelling time to a maximum of three days. The annual travel allowance is based on kilometric distance by railway, which is often not the most habitual route to travel to the place of origin. Therefore, the distance would be calculated as a great circle distance, which would have an effect of decreasing individual allowances. Furthermore, the payment of annual travel expenses would be limited to territories of the Member States of the EU. In order to reduce the administrative burden both for the staff members concerned and the administration, the rules on the reimbursement of removal costs should be simplified. It is therefore proposed to introduce cost ceilings which take account of the official's or agent's family situation and of the average cost of removal and associated insurance. The rules on mission should be adapted in order to take account of the specific need of an institution whose staff members must frequently go on mission to the principal places of work of their institution. It is proposed to allow in such cases the reimbursement of accommodation costs on the basis of a flat-rate sum; - transparency measures for Institutions and agencies : the Staff Regulations are implemented through a series of measures adopted by the Institutions and agencies. In order to ensure coherent and harmonised implementation of the Staff Regulations and for reasons of simplification, the Commission implementing rules would apply by analogy to agencies. However, in order to take account of the specific situation of agencies, they will be able, after receiving an authorisation from the Commission. - career of assistants, new career stream for secretaries and more flexibility in recruiting contract staff : reserving the highest grades for staff with the high level of responsibilities : in order to establish a clear link between responsibilities and grade, the career stream in the assistants' function group would be restructured in such a way to reserve the two highest grades (AST 10 and 11) only for officials and temporary agents who exercise significant responsibilities for staff management, budget implementation and/or coordination. new function group ""AST/SC"" for secretaries and clerical staff : a new function group ""AST/SC"" for secretarial and clerical staff should be introduced. Salaries and promotion rates proposed for this new function group establish a suitable correspondence between the level of responsibility and the level of remuneration. In this way it will be possible to preserve a stable, comprehensive and well-balanced European civil service, as considered necessary by many institutions. recruitment of contract staff : in order to give more flexibility to the institutions, the maximum length of contracts for auxiliary contract staff would be extended from 3 to 6 years. In addition, while the vast majority of officials will continue to be recruited on the basis of open competitions, the institutions would be authorised to organise internal competitions which are also open to contract staff. addressing unjustified geographical imbalances : the Staff Regulations stipulate that European Union officials are to be recruited on the broadest possible geographical basis. However, the statistical data show that, while some nationalities are overrepresented in comparison with the relative weight of their population in the European Union, others are largely under-represented. These imbalances are particularly noticeable in certain grades. Therefore, Article 27 of the Staff Regulations should be amended in order to allow the institutions to take measures correcting long lasting and significant geographical imbalances, while preserving the principle of recruitment based upon the highest standard of ability, efficiency and integrity. This measure shall be adopted by way of general implementing measures and shall be subject to a report after five years. - increasing efficiency in staff management for the agencies : t oday there are 45 structures (32 regulatory agencies, 7 joint undertakings and 6 executive agencies). In total, they employ almost 8 000 members of staff, mostly engaged as temporary agents. However, the provisions of the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants are not fully adapted to the needs of small structures such as agencies. For this reason the Commission suggests introducing a new category of temporary staff for agencies. They would be recruited following a transparent and objective selection procedure and could be engaged for an indefinite period of time. If necessary, agencies would be able to second them in the interests of the service. Also, temporary staff in agencies could take unpaid leave up to a maximum of 15 years throughout their entire career. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal would have a budgetary impact on the expenditure and revenue of the European Union. Due to transitional provisions, the financial impact of certain provisions would gradually increase and would reach its full effect only in the long term. The savings over the next multiannual financial framework are estimated to exceed EUR 1 billion. In the long run, the savings from the proposed amendments would be 1 billion Euros per year. More details are provided in the financial statement, which is annexed to this proposal."

The MLC, adopted in 2006, provides comprehensive rights and protection at work for all seafarers regardless of their nationality and the flag of the ship. It aims to both achieve decent working conditions for seafarers and secure fair competition for quality shipowners. It sets out seafarers' rights to decent conditions of work on a wide range of subjects, and has been designed to be globally applicable, easily understandable, updatable and uniformly enforced. Council Decision 2007/431/EC has authorised the Member States to ratify the Convention. Member States should ratify it as soon as possible. Port State control is regulated at EU level by Directive 2009/16/EC, which aims at helping to drastically reduce substandard shipping. In addition, Directive 2009/13/EC implements certain standards of the MLC within Union law. While Directive 2009/16/EC already refers to the MLC and to ILO standards, it needs to be updated to take into account the new documents and arrangements brought in by the MLC. This initiative is part of the EU policy on the maritime professions. It follows from the Communication entitled “Strategic goals and recommendations for the EU's maritime transport policy until 2018”, and the White Paper on the Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system, which highlights the importance of a social agenda for the maritime transport. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a directive concerning the flag State responsibilities for the enforcement of Directive 2009/13/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a full public consultation offered an opportunity for Member States and stakeholders to express their views in June 2011. There was a general consensus on the need for updating the legislation related to flag State and port State in order to enforce the MLC requirements. The specific positive effects which were underlined consisted of reinforcing maritime safety, improving quality shipping, making the conditions of competition fairer between EU and non EU operators and between EU and non EU flags. Stakeholders also mentioned the better job quality for all seafarers. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) TFEU. CONTENT : the proposal aims to amend the port State control Directive in order to: include the maritime labour certificate and the declaration of maritime labour compliance among the documents to be checked by inspectors; extend the scope of inspections to new items (for ex, the existence of an adequate labour contract signed by both parties for each seafarer with the required clauses in the contract); extend the scope of investigation in case of complaints and provide the adequate procedure. Further to Joint Political Declarations, the Commission is now considering the need for explanatory documents on a case by case basis. By virtue of the principle of proportionality, explanatory documents have not been deemed justified in the present proposal since it modifies only a limited number of legal obligations of an existing directive. Thus, the proposal does not include the recital on explanatory documents. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this Commission proposal concerns the review of the list of priority substances (PS) in the field of water policy, i.e. the chemicals identified among those presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment at EU level which are listed in Annex X to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC. The revision takes place following the review of priority substances required by both the WFD and the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (EQSD) 2008/105/EC. In the course of reviewing the priority substances list, improvements in the functioning of the EQSD were identified, as well as a mechanism for improving the identification of additional priority substances in future reviews. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t echnical work on the review of the PS list began in 2007 and was supported by an extensive consultation with experts from the Commission services, Member States, stakeholders and the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER). As the technical work was in its final stages in 2010, work on the impact assessment began with the commencement of a study by the consultancy Entec. The Impact Assessment Board discussed the Impact Assessment report at its meeting on 22 June 2011. The comments made were addressed in the accompanying Impact Assessment report. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal is limited to the identification of priority substances and to establishing EQS at EU level. The main amendments are as follows: Amendments to Annex X of the WFD : the updated Annex X includes the newly proposed priority substances and identifies two existing priority substances as priority hazardous substances. The new list is comprised of the following: Plant protection product substances: Aclonifen, Bifenox, Cypermethrin, Dicofol, Heptachlor, Quinoxyfen Substances used in biocidal products: Cybutryne, Dichlorvos, Terbutryn Industrial chemicals: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) Combustion by-products: Dioxin and Dioxin-Like PCBs Pharmaceutical substances: 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), Diclofenac. Amendments to EQSD : the main amendments are as follows: New Annex for priority substances and biota : Part A of Annex I is replaced by Annex II to this Directive. The latter introduces the newly proposed priority substances, amends the EQS for some of the existing priority substances and introduces a column for biota standards. This latter column includes the three biota standards that were already established by EQSD as well as biota standards for some other existing priority substances and some new priority substances. Listing the biota standards in Annex I of the EQSD simplifies presentation and improves clarity. Matrix : a definition of “matrix” is introduced i.e. the environmental compartment to which the EQS apply and in which the concentrations of priority substances and priority hazard substances are therefore to be monitored: usually water, sediment or biota (fish unless otherwise stated). The text is amended to make it coherent with the new structure of Part A of Annex I (in particular with the inclusion of biota standards in the Annex), and to amend the obligations of Member States as regards the selection of the matrix for monitoring. A default monitoring matrix is specified for each substance, on the basis of its intrinsic properties. The existing flexibility for Member States to choose an alternative matrix is retained, but it is now conditional on the fulfilment of the minimum analytical performance criteria in Article 4 of Commission Directive 2009/90/EC11. Notification : the notification obligations set out in the EQSD are integrated into the reporting of the river basin management plans under the WFD. Comitology : the comitology mandate to amend paragraph 3 of Part B of Annex I is aligned to the new delegated powers under Article 290 of the Treaty. Furthermore, changes are made to the text to align it with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on Commission implementing powers. PBT substances : persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs) and other substances that behave like PBTs may be found for decades in the aquatic environment at levels posing a significant risk, even if extensive measures to reduce or eliminate emissions have already been taken. A new provision is inserted that makes specific provision for substances behaving as ubiquitous persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances. Watch list : a new provision is inserted to establish a watch list for the targeted collection of monitoring data to support future reviews of the priority substances list. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal contains no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: many activities related to preparedness and response planning and risk assessment for communicable diseases but also for chemical threats to health and events caused by climate change have been supported at European level, in particular the current Community network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases (see Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community). The EU already has policies, mechanisms and instruments in place for the prevention and control of serious cross-border threats and for the development of capacities to manage crises. A non-exhaustive list includes the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the Cohesion and Solidarity Funds, the EU action plan on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security, and European alert networks, such as ECURIE. In order to avoid overlaps with these areas and duplicating existing disaster prevention and control structures, a gap analysis has been carried out to assess how far these existing systems cover the monitoring of threats to health, their notification, risk assessment and crisis management capacities and structures from the public health perspective. This gap analysis revealed that the existing structures and mechanisms at EU level do not address these threats sufficiently as far as public health is concerned. The lack of public health risk assessment at EU level leads to discrepancies in evaluating the danger of a given threat, duplication of assessments between Member States and inconsistent measures at EU level. Such a situation can also lead to inefficient use of the limited resources currently available. Although the Member States have the responsibility to manage public health crises at national level, no country can tackle a cross border public health crisis on its own. At EU level, the legal basis for addressing serious cross-border health threats has been reinforced with the Lisbon Treaty. The EU can now take action in this field that complement and support national policies and encourage cooperation between Member States. This is the reason why it is proposed to create a new instrument to step up cooperation and strengthen coordination in the area of the notification and risk assessment. The aim is to streamline and strengthen European Union capacities and structures for effectively responding to serious cross-border health threats. These threats can be events caused by communicable diseases, biological agents responsible for non-communicable diseases, and threats of chemical, environmental, or unknown origin, as well as threats deriving from the effects of climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: The Commission has carried out detailed analysis of three options: Option 1 : status quo: maintaining the current level of activities; Option 2: separate and different handling of serious cross-border threats to health - enhanced EU cooperation through the use of soft instruments based on a voluntary approach; Option 3 : establishing a common EU legal framework covering all serious cross-border threats to health through improved cooperation and legally binding measures. The results of the analysis led to the conclusion that option 3 has the strongest positive health impacts as it improves the protection of citizens against serious cross-border threats to health. LEGAL BASIS: Article 168, paragraphs (4)(c) and (5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal lays down the rules on monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health, as well as on preparedness and response planning related to those activities. It aims to support the prevention and control of the spread of severe human diseases across the borders of the Member States, and to obviate other major sources of serious cross-border threat to health in order to contribute to a high level of public health protection in the Union. Scope : the proposal applies in case of serious cross-border threats to health falling within the following categories: threats of biological origin, consisting of: (i) communicable diseases; (ii) antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections related to communicable diseases; (iii) biotoxins or other toxic biological agents not related to communicable diseases; threats of chemical origin with the exception of threats arising from ionizing radiation; threats of environmental origin, including threats deriving from the effects of climate change; threats of unknown origin; events which may constitute public health emergencies of international concern determined pursuant to the International Health Regulations (2005). General structure : the monitoring system revolves around the following four fields: 1) preparedness and response planning : the proposal provides for the coordination of the efforts of the Member States in terms of improved preparedness and capacity building. To this end, the Commission will ensure coordination between national planning and between key sectors such as transport, energy and civil protection, and will support Member States in setting up a joint procurement mechanism for medical countermeasures, e.g. vaccines against influenza, which would enable the EU to be better prepared for future pandemics; 2) establishment of an epidemiological monitoring network: to provide the relevant information and data for risk assessment and monitoring of emerging threats, an ad hoc network will be set up in situations where a Member State has raised an alert on a serious threat other than a communicable disease. Communicable diseases will continue to be monitored as they are today; 3) the use of the existing Early Warning and Response System to cover all serious threats to health, and not only communicable diseases as is the case today; 4) coordinated development of national or European public health risk assessments for threats of biological, chemical, environmental or unknown origin in a crisis situation. EU response to a public health crisis: the proposal sets up a coherent framework for the EU response to a public health crisis. In concrete terms, by formalising the existing Health Security Committee, the EU will be in a better position to coordinate national crisis responses in a public health emergency. A procedure for the mobilisation and coordination of the European response to a serious cross-border risk is proposed. Thus, if a Member State intends to adopt public health measures to combat a serious cross-border health risk, it shall, before adopting any measures consult the other Member States and the Commission on the nature, purpose and scope of the measures. The measures taken shall be decided by means of implementing acts. Provision is also made for the following specific measures: Common temporary public health measures to control the spread of a serious cross-border threat to health between the Member States or to the Union as a whole; Emergency and pandemic influenza situations at the Union level ; International agreements with third countries or international organisations. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this legal proposal does not impact on decentralised agencies. In addition, the current EU health programme already covers some activities in relation to monitoring, alerting and risk assessment of some health threats. After 2013, the Commission intends to cover these activities under the proposed Health for growth programme 2014-2020. The cost is included in the proposed envelope of the new programme. DELEGATED ACTS: in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of measures needed to complement the action of the Member States, in very specific and urgent situations, for the transnational aspects of the control of serious cross-border threats to health. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts in relation to: the procedures for the coordination, the exchange of information and the mutual consultation on preparedness and response planning; the adoption of a list of communicable diseases subject to the network of epidemiological surveillance and the procedures for the operation of such a network; the setting up and termination of ad hoc monitoring networks and the procedures for the operation of such networks; the adoption of case definitions for serious cross-border threats to health; the procedures for the operation of the Early Warning and Response System; the procedures for the coordination of the responses of the Member States; the recognition of situations of emergency at Union level or of pre-pandemic situations with respect to human influenza at Union level."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: The EU completed in early August 2010 the disbursement of a EUR 46 million macrofinancial assistance (MFA) operation to Georgia approved by the Council in November 2009. The assistance, which was provided in the form of grants, was part of a pledge of two possible MFA operations of the same amount made by the European Commission at the International Donors' Conference of October 2008. The approval of the second MFA was conditional on the continued existence of external financing needs over and above those covered by the IMF arrangement. In a letter from 10 May 2010, the Georgian Minister of Finance requested the activation of the second part of the Commission pledge of EU funds, amounting to EUR 46 million, which is the subject of this proposal. The Commission considers that the activation of the second part of the MFA pledged in 2008 is warranted. Although the Georgian economy is recovering (following the double shock caused by the military conflict with Russia of August 2008 and the global financial crisis), the balance of payments and budgetary position remain weak and vulnerable. The new MFA would contribute to help Georgia to address the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis. The new MFA will support the economic reform agenda of the government. It would reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance would also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management, as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the MFA and the economic adjustment and reform programme attached to it will help alleviate Georgia's short-term financing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening medium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability, raising sustainable growth and promoting economic integration and regulatory convergence with the EU. It will also help improve the efficiency and transparency of public finance management, building on the positive impact of the previous MFA operation in the country. MFA will also support the macroeconomic stabilisation and structural policies of the programme agreed with the IMF. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the EU shall make the MFA available to Georgia for a total maximum amount of EUR 46 million, half of which will be provided as grants and half as loans. The assistance will contribute to cover Georgia's residual external financing needs in 2009-2011, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance will be disbursed in 2011 in two equal instalments, each of them consisting of a grant and a loan element. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be taken into account. The main points are as follows: the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2011; the second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the third quarter of 2011; as is usual with the MFA instrument, the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement; in addition, the Commission and the Georgian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. In the context of the previous MFA operations, the Commission services have worked closely with the Georgian authorities on public finance management (PFM) reforms that aim at establishing a more transparent, coherent and accountable PFM system; in the new MFA operation, the scope of the policy conditionality would be enlarged, notably to measures aimed at fostering the economic and financial integration as well as regulatory harmonisation with the EU in selected areas, under the ENP Action Plan and taking into account the new context created by the plan to conclude an Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia; the new MFA would be exceptional and limited in time and is intended to run in parallel to the SBA. It will complement support from international and bilateral donors; the proposal includes a sunset clause. The proposed MFA would be made available for 2.5 years starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Following the successful implementation of the last MFA, in which the Georgian authorities demonstrated the political will and the capacity to implement structural reforms, the Commission believes that also this second MFA operation would contribute to the implementation of the government's agenda of structural reforms. The conditions will be consistent with the priorities of the EU-Georgia ENP Action Plan. The decision to disburse half of the proposed assistance in grants and the other half in loans is justified by Georgia’s level of development (as measured by its per capital income) and debt indicators, and the recent improvement in the country's economic situation. The full use of grants in the previous operation had to be understood as an exceptional decision justified by the very difficult circumstances Georgia found itself in late 2008. The blend of grants and loans is also consistent with the fact that Georgia has been a blend country for the World Bank since January 2009. For the forthcoming World Bank operations, the country is expected to receive one third of the World Bank assistance in the form of the IDA lending, while two thirds of the assistance are expected to be provided on IBRD terms. The new MFA will reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance will also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management (building on those of the previous operation and of the EU's sectoral budgetary support operation), as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the grant element of the assistance of EUR 23 million would be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2011 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), with payments taking place in 2011. In line with the Guarantee Fund Regulation, the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund is expected to take place in 2013 and to amount to a maximum of EUR 2.1 million. This corresponds to 9% of the EUR 23 million loan expected to be disbursed in 2011."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in recent years, the number of attacks against IT systems has risen steadily in Europe. Moreover, previously unknown large-scale and dangerous attacks against the information systems of companies, such as banks, the public sector and even the military, have been observed in the Member States and other countries. New concerns, such as the massive spread of malicious software creating 'botnets' - networks of infected computers that can be remotely controlled to stage large-scale, coordinated attacks - have emerged. Such network of compromised computers ('zombies') may be activated to perform specific actions such as attacks against information systems (cyber attacks). These 'zombies' can be controlled – often without the knowledge of the users of the compromised computers – by another computer. This 'controlling' computer is also known as the 'command-and-control centre'. The people who control this centre are among the offenders, as they use the compromised computers to launch attacks against information systems. With regard to cybercrime, the main cause of this phenomenon is vulnerability resulting from a variety of factors. Insufficient response by law enforcement mechanisms contributes to the prevalence of these phenomena, and exacerbates the difficulties, as certain types of offences go beyond national borders. Variations i n national criminal law and procedure may give rise to differences in investigation and prosecution, leading to differences in how these crimes are dealt with. Developments in information technology have exacerbated these problems by making it easier to produce and distribute tools ('malware' and 'botnets'), while offering offenders anonymity and dispersing responsibility across jurisdictions. Given the difficulties of bringing a prosecution, organised crime is able to make considerable profits with little risk. On 24 February 2005, EU Member States agreed a Council Framework Decision (2005/222/JHA) that addresses the most significant forms of criminal activity against information systems, such as hacking, viruses and denial of service attacks. The Framework Decision seeks to approximate criminal law across the EU to ensure that Europe's law enforcement and judicial authorities can take action against this form of crime. Member States were required to take the necessary measures to comply with the provisions of the Framework Decision by 16 March 2007. On 14 July 2008, the Commission published a report on the implementation of the Framework Decision. It was noted that several emerging threats had been highlighted by recent attacks across Europe since adoption of the Framework Decision, in particular the emergence of large-scale simultaneous attacks against information systems and increased criminal use of so-called 'botnets'."" These attacks were not the centre of attention when the Framework Decision was adopted. In response to these developments, the Commission presents this proposal which aims to consider recent technical advances and the new modi operandi found in today's cyber attacks as devise better responses to the threat. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: various policy options have been examined as a means of achieving the objective. Option 1: Status Quo / No new EU action . Option 2: Development of a programme to strengthen the efforts to counter attacks against information systems by means of non-legislative measures : these measures would, in addition to the programme for critical information infrastructure protection, focus on cross-border law enforcement and public-private cooperation. These soft-law instruments should aim to promote further coordinated action at EU level, including strengthening of the existing 24/7 network of contact points for law enforcement agencies; establishment of an EU network of public-private contact points involving cybercrime experts and law enforcement agencies; elaboration of a standard EU service level agreement for law enforcement cooperation with private sector operators; and support for the organisation of training programmes for law enforcement agencies on the investigation of cybercrime. Option 3: Targeted update of the rules of the Framework Decision (new Directive replacing the current Framework Decision) to address the threat from large-scale attacks against information systems (botnets) and, when committed by concealing the real identity of the perpetrator and causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner, the efficiency of Member States' law enforcement contact points, and the lack of statistical data on cyber attacks. Option 4: Introduction of comprehensive EU legislation against cybercrime : this option would entail new comprehensive EU legislation. In addition to introducing the soft-law measures in policy option 2 and the update in policy option 3, it would also tackle other legal problems related to Internet use (such as financial cybercrime, illegal Internet content, the collection/storage/transfer of electronic evidence…) Option 5: Update of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime : this option would require substantial renegotiation of the current Convention, which is a lengthy process and doesn’t seem realistic as there seems to be no international willingness to renegotiate the Convention. The preferred policy option is a combination of non-legislative measures (option 2) with a targeted update of the Framework Decision (option 3). LEGAL BASE: Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Directive, while repealing Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA, will retain its current provisions and include the following new elements: On substantive criminal law in general , the proposed Directive: 1) Penalises the production, sale, procurement for use, import, distribution or otherwise making available of devices/tools used for committing the offences. 2) Includes aggravating circumstances: the large-scale aspect of the attacks - botnets or similar tools would be addressed by introducing a new aggravating circumstance, in the sense that the act of putting in place a botnet or a similar tool would be an aggravating factor when crimes listed in the existing Framework Decision are committed; when such attacks are committed by concealing the real identity of the perpetrator and causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner. Any such rules would need to comply with the principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties and be consistent with existing legislation on the protection of personal data . 3) Introduces ‘illegal interception’ as a criminal offence. 4) Introduces measures to improve European criminal justice cooperation by strengthening the existing structure of 24/7 contact points: an obligation to comply with a request for assistance by the operational contact points (set out in Article 14 of the Directive) within a certain time limit is proposed. The Cybercrime Convention does not specify a binding provision of this kind. The aim of this measure is to ensure that the contact points indicate within a specified time whether they are able to provide a solution to the request for assistance, and by when the requesting point of contact can expect such a solution to be found. The actual content of the solutions is not specified. 5) Addresses the need to provide statistical data on cybercrimes by making it obligatory for the Member States to ensure that an adequate system is in place for the recording, production and provision of statistical data on the offences referred to in the existing Framework Decision and the newly added ‘illegal interception’. Taking account of gravity of the crimes : the Directive contains in the definitions of criminal offences listed in articles 3, 4, 5 (illegal access to information systems, illegal systems interference and illegal interference) a provision allowing to criminalise only 'cases which are not minor' in the process of transposition of the directive into national law. This element of flexibility is intended to allow Member States not to cover cases that would in abstracto be covered by the basic definition but are considered not to harm the protected legal interest, e.g. in particular acts by young people who attempt to prove their expertise in information technology. This possibility to limit the scope of criminalisation should not however lead to the introduction of additional constitutive elements of offences beyond those that are already included in the Directive, because this would lead to the situation that only offences committed with the presence of aggravating circumstances are covered. In the process of transposition, Member States should refrain in particular from adding additional constitutive elements to the basic offences such as e.g. a special intention to derive illicit proceeds from crime or the presence of a specific effect such as causing a considerable damage. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the implications of the proposal for the Union budget are small. More than 90% of the estimated cost of EUR 5 913 000 would be borne by the Member States and there is the possibility of applying for EU funding to reduce the cost."

(2) Likewise, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts concerning: technical rules for measuring mesh sizes; square-meshed netting and twine thickness; technical rules related to the construction of netting materials; listing of devices that may obstruct or otherwise diminish the effective mesh opening in a fishing net; transmission of lists of vessels to which a special fishing permit to use beam trawls has been issued; technical rules related to measuring engine power and gear dimensions; the obligation of Member States to ensure that levels of fishing effort are not exceeded in certain areas of ICES Division IXa, and temporary measures where the conservation of stocks of marine organisms calls for immediate action. The implementing powers conferred upon the Commission, except those concerning the obligation of Member States to ensure that levels of fishing effort are not exceeded in certain areas of ICES Division IXa, should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union stipulates the right to a fair trial. The right of access to a lawyer is enshrined in Article 6 of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and in Article 14(2) of the ICCPR. The right to communicate with a third party is one of the important safeguards against ill treatment prohibited by Article 3 ECHR and the right to have one’s consulate informed of detention builds upon the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The European Court of Human Rights has consistently held that the suspect or accused person should have access to a lawyer at the initial stages of police questioning, and in any event from the start of detention, to protect the right to a fair trial, and in particular the privilege against self-incrimination and to avoid ill treatment. Derogations from the right of access to a lawyer and the right to communicate upon arrest should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. The Council recognised that to date, not enough had been done at European level to safeguard the fundamental rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The proposal is the next step in the series of measures laid down in the Resolution of the Council of 30 November 2009 on a Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings, appended to the Stockholm Programme approved by the European Council of 10-11 December 2010. The Roadmap invites the Commission to put forward proposals on a ‘step-by-step’ basis. The proposal is the next step in the series of measures laid down in a Resolution of the Council of 30 November 2009 on a Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings, appended to the Stockholm Programme approved by the European Council of 10-11 December 2010. The Roadmap invites the Commission to put forward proposals on a ‘step-by-step’ basis. This proposal should therefore be considered as part of a comprehensive package of legislation to be presented over the next few years, which will provide a minimum set of procedural rights in criminal proceedings in the European Union. The issue of legal aid, which was conflated with that of access to a lawyer in the Roadmap, warrants a separate proposal owing to the specificity and complexity of the subject. the first step is Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation; the second step will be a Directive, currently under negotiation on the basis of a Commission proposal, on the right to information, which will set out minimum rules on the right to receive information on one’s rights, and on the charges, as well as on the right of access to the case file. Having common minimum standards governing these rights should boost mutual trust between judicial authorities and thus facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the Directive is to lay down rules governing the rights of suspected and accused persons and persons subject to an European Arrest warrant to have access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings against them, and rules governing the right of suspects and accused persons who are deprived of their liberty to communicate upon arrest with a third party, such as a relative, employer or consular authority. The Directive applies from the time that a person is made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State, by official notification or otherwise, that he is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings (including any appeal). The main elements of this proposal are the following: The right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings : the proposal lays down the general principle that all suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings should have access to a lawyer as soon as possible, in time and in a manner that allows them to exercise their defence rights. Access to a lawyer must be granted at the latest upon deprivation of liberty, as soon as possible in the light of the circumstances of each case. Irrespective of any deprivation of liberty, access to a lawyer must be granted upon questioning. Content of the right of access to a lawyer : the proposal sets out the activities that a lawyer representing an accused or suspected person must be entitled to carry out to ensure effective exercise of defence rights, including meeting with the suspect or accused person for an adequate duration and frequency to ensure the effective exercise of the rights of defence; attending any questioning or hearing. The right to communicate upon arrest : the proposal provides for the right of persons deprived of their liberty in criminal proceedings to communicate as soon as possible upon arrest with one person nominated by them, which is most likely to be a relative or employer, so as to inform him of the detention. Legal representatives of children deprived of their liberty should be notified as soon as possible of the child’s custody and the reasons pertaining thereto, unless it is against the best interests of the child. Where it is not possible to communicate with or notify the person designated by the detained person despite best endeavours to do so, the detained person is to be informed of the fact that the notification did not occur. Any consequences are left to national law. The right to communicate with consular or diplomatic authorities : this provision confirms the right to communicate with consular authorities. It places a duty on Member States to ensure that all foreign detainees are able to have the consular authorities of their State of nationality informed of the detention if they so wish. Confidentiality : d efence rights are protected by the obligation to ensure that all communications, in whatever form they take, between a suspected and accused person and his lawyer are entirely confidential, with no scope for derogations. Derogations : given the paramount importance of the rights enshrined in this Directive suggests that derogations for Member States should not be possible, in principle. Limited scope for derogations, however, is admitted by the ECtHR jurisprudence as concerns the initial stages of criminal proceedings. Member States may be allowed to derogate from the right of access to a lawyer only in exceptional circumstances, subject to necessity and to procedural safeguards. Any derogation must be justified by compelling reasons pertaining to the urgent need to avert danger for the life or physical integrity of one or more people. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: market abuse harms the integrity of financial markets and public confidence in securities and derivatives. Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) completed and updated the Union's legal framework to protect market integrity. The European Commission has assessed the application of the Directive and has identified a number of problems which have negative impacts in terms of market integrity and investor protection, lead to an uneven playing field and result in compliance costs and disincentives for issuers, whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on SME growth markets, to raise capital. The main problems are as follows: market and technological developments , gaps in the regulation of new markets, platforms and over the counter instruments have emerged. Similarly, these same factors have led to gaps in the regulation of commodities and related derivatives. regulators lack certain information and powers , and sanctions are either lacking or insufficiently dissuasive, which mean that regulators cannot effectively enforce the Directive; lastly, the existence of numerous options and discretions in the Directive, as well as a lack of clarity on certain key concepts, undermines the effectiveness of the Directive. The importance of market integrity has been highlighted by the current global economic and financial crisis. In line with the G20 findings, the report by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU recommended that a sound prudential and conduct of business framework for the financial sector must rest on strong supervisory and sanctioning regimes. In its Communication on ""Ensuring efficient, safe and sound derivatives markets: Future policy actions"" the Commission undertook to extend relevant provisions of the Directive in order to cover derivatives markets in a comprehensive fashion. Furthermore, a review of existing sanctioning powers and their practical application aimed at promoting convergence of sanctions across the range of supervisory activities has been carried out in the Commission Communication on sanctions in the financial services sector. The Directive should now be replaced to ensure that it keeps pace with developments in the market, given the legislative, market and technological developments that have resulted in considerable changes to the financial landscape. The aim is to increase market integrity and investor protection, while ensuring a single rulebook and level playing field and increasing the attractiveness of securities markets for raising capital. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the initiative is the result of extensive consultations with all major stakeholders, including public authorities (governments and securities regulators), issuers, intermediaries and investors. The Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options related to: (i) regulation of new markets, platforms and OTC instruments, commodities and related derivatives; (ii) sanctions, (iii) powers of competent authorities; (iii) clarification of key concepts and (iv) reducing administrative burdens. The overall impact of all the preferred policy options will lead to considerable improvements in addressing market abuse within the EU. This will be done through: improving market integrity and investor protection by clarifying which financial instruments and markets are covered, ensuring that instruments admitted to trading only on a multilateral trading facility (MTF) and other new types of organised trading facilities (OTFs) are covered; improving protection against market abuse through commodity derivatives by improved market transparency ; ensuring better detection of market abuse by offering the necessary powers to competent authorities to perform investigations and improve the deterrence of sanctioning regimes by introducing minimum principles for administrative measures or sanctions; a more coherent approach regarding market abuse by reducing options and discretions for Member States; introducing a proportionate regime for issuers , whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on SME growth markets. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to establish a common regulatory framework on market abuse to ensure the integrity of financial markets in the Union and to enhance investor protection and confidence in those markets. Scope : the development of new platforms, new technologies such as high frequency trading and an increase in trading across different venues has made it more difficult to monitor for possible market abuse. The proposal: extends the scope of the market abuse framework applying to any financial instrument admitted to trading on a MTF or an OTF, as well as to any related financial instruments traded OTC which can have an effect on the covered underlying market; specifies further specific examples of strategies using algorithmic trading and high frequency trading, such as quote stuffing, layering and spoofing, that fall within the prohibition against market manipulation; extends the scope of the Directive so that the general definition of inside information in relation to financial markets and commodity derivatives should also apply to all information which is relevant to the related commodity; expressly prohibits attempts at market manipulation, which will enhance market integrity; reclassifies emission allowances as financial instruments as part of the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. As a result, they will also fall into the scope of the market abuse framework. Inside information : the state of contract negotiations, terms provisionally agreed in contract negotiations, the possibility of the placement of financial instruments, conditions under which financial instruments will be marketed, or provisional terms for the placement of financial instruments may be relevant information for investors. Therefore, such information should qualify as inside information. Public disclosure of inside information: in accordance with the proposal, issuers will be required to inform the competent authorities of their decision to delay the disclosure of inside information immediately after such a disclosure is made. The responsibility for assessing whether such delay is justified remains with the issuer. Competent authorities will have the power to investigate ex post whether in fact the specific conditions for the delay were met will increase investor protection and market integrity; the market abuse framework is adapted to the characteristics and needs of issuers, whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on SME growth markets. Issuers are exempt, under certain conditions, from the obligation to keep and constantly update insiders' lists, and benefit from the new threshold for the reporting of manager's transactions mentioned below. The proposal introduces a threshold of EUR 20 000, uniform in all Member States, which triggers the obligation to report such manager's transactions. ESMA and Competent Authorities: the proposed regulation allows competent authorities access to continuous data by requiring such data to be directly submitted to them in a specified format. By gaining access to spot commodity market traders' systems, competent authorities are also able to monitor real-time data flows; competent authorities will be able to require existing telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunication operator or by an investment firm, or to have access to private premises and seize documents, where a reasonable suspicion exists that such records related to the subject-matter of the inspection may be relevant to prove insider dealing or market manipulation as defined in the proposal; as market abuse can take place across borders and different markets, ESMA has a strong coordination role and competent authorities are required to cooperate and exchange information with other competent authorities and, when applicable to commodity derivatives, with the regulatory authorities responsible for the related spot markets, within the Union and in third countries. Sanctions : this Regulation introduces minimum rules for administrative measures, sanctions and fines. This does not prevent individual Member States from fixing higher standards. The proposal provides for the disgorgement of any profits where identified, including interests, and, in order to ensure an appropriate deterrent effect, it introduces fines which must exceed any profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the violation of this Regulation. Moreover, criminal sanctions have a stronger deterrent effect than administrative measures and sanctions. The proposal for a Directive on sanctions introduces the requirement for all Member States to put in place effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions for the most serious insider dealing and market manipulation offences. Protection and incentives for whistleblowers : the regulation enhances the market abuse framework in the Union introducing appropriate protection for whistleblowers reporting suspected market abuse, the possibility of financial incentives for persons who provide competent authorities with salient information that leads to a monetary sanction, and enhancements of Member States' provisions for receiving and reviewing whistleblowing notifications. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to task allocated to ESMA. Total appropriations are estimated at EUR 832 000 from 2013 to 2015. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU."

BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 for the conservation of fishery through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound confers powers upon the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts).

Delegated acts: the Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend the technical specifications of two parts of the fishing gears improving selectivity: namely the Bacoma type exit window and the netting in the cod-end and extension piece being turned 90° (T90 trawl). Implementing acts: implementing powers will be conferred on the Commission in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 as regards measures taken by Member States which apply only to fishing vessels flying their flag.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/28/EC (the ""Renewable Energy Directive"") established mandatory targets of 20% overall share of renewable energy in the EU by 2020 and a 10% share for renewable energy in the transport sector. At the same time, an amendment to Directive 98/70/EC (""the Fuel Quality Directive"") introduced a mandatory target of a 6% reduction by 2020 in the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used in road transport and non-road mobile machinery. The contribution of biofuels towards these targets is expected to be significant. Whilst both Directives include sustainability criteria including minimum greenhouse gas saving thresholds, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with changes in the carbon stock of land resulting from indirect changes in land use (ILUC) are not subject to reporting requirements under the current legislation. The Commission was invited to review the impact of indirect land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions and, if appropriate, propose ways to minimise it whilst respecting existing investments made in biofuels production. The Commission Communication of 2010 identified a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the available numerical models used to quantify indirect land-use change, whilst acknowledging that indirect land-use change can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions savings associated with biofuels and bioliquids, and as such, recommended that this issue was to be addressed under a precautionary approach. Scientific work indicates that emissions from indirect land-use change can vary substantially between feedstocks and can negate some or all of the greenhouse gas savings of individual biofuels relative to the fossil fuels they replace. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to amend the existing legislation with a view to limiting the contribution that conventional biofuels (with a risk of ILUC emissions) make towards attainment of the targets in the Renewable Energy Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this Commission proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: in order to ensure an increased use of sustainable biofuels to meet the necessary targets, the Commission is proposing to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive. 1. Introduction of limits on the contribution that conventional biofuels and bioliquids produced from food crops, such as those based on cereals and other starch rich crops, sugars and oil crops, to the Renewable Energy Directive targets to current consumption levels, without foreseeing any limits on their overall consumption. The Commission is proposing to limit to the current level of consumption, i.e. 5%, the volume of biofuels and bioliquids produced from crops used for food and feed that can be included in the EU’s 10% target for renewable energy target for 2020 for the transport sector, while maintaining the overall renewable energy and carbon intensity reduction targets. 2. An increase to 60% of the minimum greenhouse gas saving threshold for biofuels and bioliquids produced in new installations, with effect from 1st July 201,4 in order to improve the EU’s overall greenhouse gas balance, as well as discouraging further investments in installations with low greenhouse gas savings performance. 3. The introduction of the reporting of estimated emissions from carbon stock changes caused by indirect land-use change, based on the best available scientific evidence, for the purposes of the calculation of the life cycle greenhouse gas emission savings from biofuels and bioliquids, in the reports required to be provided by fuel suppliers and the Member States on greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels and bioliquids. 4. A strengthened incentive mechanism to further promote sustainable and advanced biofuels from feedstocks that do not create an additional demand for land. 5. The simplification of the calculation of greenhouse gas savings for European biofuel producers, levelling the playing field between EU producers and producers in third countries. The proposal also seeks to protect existing investments until 2020. The Commission is of the view that, in the period after 2020, biofuels which do not lead to substantial greenhouse gas savings (when emissions from indirect land-use change are included) and are produced from crops used for food and feed should not be subsidised.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between, firstly, the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts) and, secondly, the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In this context Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 needs to be aligned with the new rules of the TFEU. Powers currently conferred upon the Commission by that Regulation should be reclassified into delegated and implementing powers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: it was not necessary to carry out an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main legal action is to identify the powers conferred upon the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 and to classify these as delegated or implementing powers. The Commission should therefore be empowered to adopt delegated acts to take measures to address a significant decline of average market prices for eels used for restocking, as compared to those of eels used for other purposes. Likewise the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts concerning the approval of Eel Management Plans by the Commission on the basis of technical and scientific data. These competences should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: · powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) TFEU (delegated acts); · and on the other hand, powers conferred on the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts, as laid down in Article 291(2) TFEU (implementing acts).

The Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of : (i) the establishment of the list of divisions per Member State, (ii) the determination of the threshold for the economic size and the number of returning holdings per division, (iii) the adoption of further rules on the qualification of returning holdings, (iv) the determination of the further content of the plan for the selection of returning holdings, (v) the adoption of further rules on the activities of Member States' National Committees for the data network, (vi) the adoption of further rules on the tasks of Member States' liaison agencies, and the adoption of rules on the accountancy data to be included in the farm return. Implementing powers will be conferred on the Commission in respect of the adoption of rules on the standard fee in the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Furthermore, for the sake of simplification and in the light of the experience gained with the application of Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 some of the provisions of that Regulation will be adapted or deleted. In particular, reports based on FADN data need no longer be submitted annually to the European Parliament and the Council for the annual fixing of prices of agricultural produce. The current provision that reports shall be submitted annually to the European Parliament and the Council is therefore obsolete. However, in order to provide convenient access to the data and reports based on FADN to other institutions as well as to the public such information should be published on a public website.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since its adoption, Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 has been amended eight times. All the recent modifications of the Regulation focused on the revision of the positive and the negative visa lists annexed to the Regulation. Over the past few years, the need arose to make some further, technical modifications as well to the main text of the Regulation, e.g. strengthening legal certainty by providing rules for certain situations which were not covered yet by the Regulation and adjusting certain definitions due to recent changes brought by secondary legislation, particularly by the adoption of the Visa Code. Furthermore, ten years after the integration of the Schengen acquis into the framework of the EU and the establishment of the common visa policy, it is necessary to make progress towards further harmonisation of the EU's common visa policy with regard to certain categories listed in the Regulation and left until now to the unilateral decisions of individual Member States. Lastly, as a result of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, further modifications are required, such as the introduction of a safeguard clause and a modification of the reciprocity mechanism. This proposal aims to reconcile these objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the present modification of the Regulation aims at : (1) making provision for a visa safeguard clause allowing the rapid, temporary suspension of the visa waiver for a third country on the positive list in case of an emergency situation, where an urgent response needs to be given to solve the difficulties faced by Member States. Following the adoption of the visa waiver for Albania and Bosnia Herzegovina, certain Member States suggested the insertion of a safeguard clause into Regulation 539/2001, giving power to the Commission to decide on a temporary suspension of the visa waiver, in accordance with a comitology procedure, if certain conditions are met. The clause would be complementary to, but distinct from, the safeguard clause in Article 78(3) of the TFEU. It should be applied only as a temporary measure in clearly defined emergency situations. It should cover only a short period of time and be triggered only in case of an emergency situation, i.e. if there is a sudden change of the situation, e.g. when the relevant figures increase suddenly within a relatively short period of time, and where an urgent ""visa"" response needs to be given to solve the difficulties faced by the Member States affected. Before the safeguard clause is triggered, the Commission will have to assess the situation and there should be no automatism flowing from the notifications by Member States. The Commission will take into account the number of Member States affected by the sudden occurrence of any of the situations listed in this proposal and the overall impact of them on the migratory situation in the EU. In accordance with the comitology rules in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, under the examination procedure, the European Parliament and the Council will receive the proposal for a Commission decision suspending the visa waiver for one or more third countries. The proposal makes provisions ofr information to be available in sufficient time for the European Parliament and the Council to reject or adopt the proposal to amend the lists of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. (2) modifying the reciprocity mechanism : a suggestion has been made by a Member State to modify the current reciprocity mechanism in order to make it more efficient. According to the suggestion, the Commission would be obliged to present a proposal, within a very short period of time, for a temporary restoration of a visa requirement for nationals of a third country, which does not lift the visa obligation within a period of no longer than 12 months of its introduction for a Member State. However, such a modification of the reciprocity mechanism would infringe the exclusive right of initiative of the Commission and would not necessarily lead to adoption of the proposed retaliatory measure. The initial reciprocity mechanism of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 already contained a certain automatism: the notification of non-reciprocity cases was not mandatory; the Member State concerned was free to decide to notify or not. But if notification took place, then Member States were obliged to impose the visa requirement for nationals of the third country concerned provisionally and automatically, 30 days after the notifications, unless the Council decided otherwise. This automatism was considered to be the weakness of the initial reciprocity mechanism and thus it has been abandoned in 2005 as being counter-productive. There is no reason to believe that it would entail more efficiency now. The current reciprocity mechanism, as modified in 2005, is considered to be overall efficient, and the cases of non-reciprocity have been considerably reduced. The remaining non-reciprocity situations are mostly cases where some Member States are considered by third countries not to meet objective criteria for visa waiver set out by these third countries in their domestic legislation. Most Member States also cautioned against an ""automatic"" (re)imposition of a visa requirement for citizens of third countries due to its political implications and advocated instead a tailor-made approach and application of provisional measures in other fields. (3) ensuring compliance with the Visa Code by providing e.g. for appropriate definitions concerning short stay and visa. Accordingly, a visa is an authorisation of transit through or for an intended stay in the territory of the Member States for duration of no more than three months in any six-month period from the date of first entry in the territory of the Member States. The airport transit visa is excluded from this definition, since the visa regime applicable by Member States to third-country nationals transiting through the international airports of Member States is regulated by and contained in the Visa Code. (4) ensuring that the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country national is to be subject to or exempt from the visa requirement . Apart from aligning the definition of “visa” with that in the Visa Code, the proposal seeks to ensure legal clarity by complementing the rules applicable to refugees and stateless persons in order to clarify the applicable visa regime for those residing in the United Kingdom or in Ireland. On the basis of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland and the United Kingdom are not participating in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and its amendments. Thus, for Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 the United Kingdom and Ireland are not considered to be Member States. Consequently, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1932/2006 on the visa rules applicable for refugees and stateless persons do not apply to such persons when they are residing in the United Kingdom or in Ireland. The proposal aims at remedying this unsatisfactory situation by including a provision into the Regulation on refugees and stateless persons residing in the UK or Ireland. (5) making progress towards a full harmonisation of the common visa policy by providing for new, more harmonised rules with regard to the visa requirement or exemption applicable to various categories of third country nationals. The proposal aims at limiting the freedom of Member States to grant visa waiver or to impose a visa requirement to various categories of persons covered by Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 by establishing further common rules on the visa requirement for some of these categories. The following provisions are made: further progress towards full harmonisation with regard to the categories of Article 4(1), for which a de facto harmonisation or quasi harmonisation already exists . Civilian air crew members are exempted from the visa requirement by all Member States. As regards civilian sea crew, all Member States but two exempt such persons from the visa requirement in case of shore leave, while all Member States but two maintain the visa requirement for transit purposes. This amendment will therefore set out the general, harmonised visa exemption for the first category and visa requirement for the second one respectively. There is only one Member State exempting flight crew and attendants on emergency or rescue flights and other helpers in case of a disaster or accident from the visa requirement, therefore this Regulation would abolish this category; procedure to exempt diplomatic and service passport holders of third countries from the visa requirement after the abolition of Council Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 : the current text of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 refers to the procedure established by Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 to be followed when a Member State decides to exempt the diplomatic and/or service passport holders of a third country from the visa requirement. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 789/2001, Member States, willing to exempt holders of diplomatic and service passports of third countries whose nationals are subject to prior consultation, should have submitted a legislative initiative, on which the Council decided by qualified majority (since 2006). As regards the holders of such passports of third countries not subject to prior consultation, Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 obliged Member States simply to communicate to the Council any amendments to their visa rules (requirement or exemption). However, Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 has been repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on visas (Visa Code). It was considered that after the repeal of the above Regulation, the appropriate place to cover these ""procedural"" aspects of national decisions on visa requirement or exemption for such passport holders would be Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, if need be. Thus, in the framework of the present modification, it needs to be examined whether a specific decision-making procedure should be provided for the case when a Member State wants to abolish the visa requirement for the diplomatic and service passport holders of a third country subject to prior consultation. The Commission considers that there is no need to establish such a specific ""common decision mechanism"" for this issue, both for institutional and substantive reasons; (6) clarifying the situation and establishing the legal basis of the visa requirement or exemption for other entities subject to international law which issue diplomatic or service passport or laissez-passers to its members: there are certain entities subject to international law, which do issue diplomatic or service passports or laissez-passers. These entities are not intergovernmental organisations, thus they are not covered at this moment by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. On the other hand they are included in the Table of travel documents and Member States declared whether they recognise their travel documents or not (e.g. Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta). It is necessary to have such entities also covered by Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and Member States should decide and notify to the Commission; (7) adopting new provision in respect of obligations for certain Member States flowing from prior EU/international agreements implying the need to derogate from the common visa rules. Prior to the establishment of the EU common visa policy, the European Union and its Member States have concluded international agreements, like association agreements, with third countries dealing i.a. with the movement of persons and services, which might have an impact on the visa requirement imposed on nationals of third countries. Such international agreements concluded by the Union take primacy over provisions of secondary EU legislation, including Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. In case such international agreements contain a so-called 'standstill clause', it might entail the obligation for certain Member States to derogate from the rules of the common visa policy in accordance with their respective legislations and practices applicable/in force on the date the standstill clause entered into force for them. Therefore, the Commission proposes the introduction in Article 4 of a provision allowing Member States to exempt service providers from the visa requirement, to the extent necessary to respect international obligations concluded by the Community before the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the budget of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the establishment of the European Banking Authority (EBA) by Regulation (EU) No. 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), and of the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) already contributed to improved cooperation between national supervisors and to the development of a single rulebook for financial services in the EU. However, supervision of banks remains to a large extent within national boundaries and thereby fails to keep up with integrated banking markets. In May 2012, the Commission therefore called for the creation of a banking union to restore confidence in banks and in the euro. Among the key elements of the banking union will be a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) with direct oversight of banks, to enforce prudential rules in a strict and impartial manner and perform effective oversight of cross border banking markets. On 29 June 2012, the Euro area Heads of State or Government called on the Commission to present proposals to provide for a single supervisory mechanism involving the European Central Bank (ECB). The European Council in its conclusions of 29 June 2012 invited the President of the European Council to develop, in close collaboration with the President of the Commission, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the ECB, a specific and time-bound road map for the achievement of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. To avoid fragmentation of the internal market following the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism, the proper functioning of the EBA needs to be ensured. The role of the EBA should therefore be preserved in order to further develop the single rulebook and ensure convergence of supervisory practices throughout the EU. Along with the proposal for a Council Regulation conferring specific tasks on the ECB concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions in accordance with Article 127(6) TFEU, this proposal introduces targeted amendments to the Regulation establishing the European Banking Authority. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has taken into account the analysis done in the context of the adoption of the ""supervisory package"" creating the European Supervisory Authorities, which assessed operational, governance, financial and legal aspects relevant to the establishment of a SSM. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal is limited to an adjustment of the procedural modalities under which the EBA operates to take account of the conferral of supervisory tasks on the ECB and to ensure that the EBA can continue to pursue its functions to protect the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the internal market for financial services and maintaining the stability of the financial system within the internal market. It does not alter the balance of respective competences between the EBA and national authorities. The proposal deals in particular with the following points: EBA powers, in particular binding mediation/emergency situations : in order to ensure that the EBA can carry out its tasks to settle disagreements and also act in emergency situations in relation to the ECB, a new provision is introduced to provide for a specific procedure in relation to the decision taken by the EBA. The procedure provides that if the ECB does not comply with an action by EBA to settle a disagreement or to address an emergency situation, it should be required to explain its reasons. In that unlikely case, where the relevant requirements are set out in directly applicable Union law, the EBA can adopt an individual decision addressed to the financial institution concerned to enforce its action, and it is normally expected to do so. Voting modalities : the fact that the ECB will coordinate the position of the Euro area Member States requires a review of the voting modalities currently provided for in the EBA regulation, in order to ensure that EBA decisions are taken in the interest of maintaining and strengthening the internal market for financial services. Composition of the Management Board : in view of the decisive influence of members from Member States participating in or closely cooperating with the single supervisory mechanism when electing the Management Board (simple majority of members present), members from Member States not participating in the SSM could not be appropriately represented adequately in the Management Board. To ensure a balanced composition of the Management Board, reflecting the EU as a whole and including Member States not participating in the single supervisory mechanism, the proposal amends the composition of the Management Board of the EBA to ensure that at least two members from Member States not participating in the single supervisory mechanism are represented in the Management Board. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : on 23 February 2006, the International Labour Organisation adopted the Maritime Labour Convention, (MLC), desiring to create a single, coherent instrument embodying as far as possible all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour Conventions and Recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions. The MLC, adopted in 2006, provides comprehensive rights and protection at work for all seafarers regardless of their nationality and the flag of the ship. It aims to both achieve decent working conditions for seafarers and secure fair competition for quality shipowners. It sets out seafarers' rights to decent conditions of work on a wide range of subjects, and has been designed to be globally applicable, easily understandable, updatable and uniformly enforced. Council Decision 2007/431/EC has authorised the Member States to ratify the Convention. Member States should ratify it as soon as possible. Council Directive 2009/13/EC implements the Agreement concluded by the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF) on the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, and amends Directive 1999/63/EC. Directive 2009/13/EC was adopted on the basis of Article 155 of the Treaty. Since agreements concluded by virtue of Article 155 of the Treaty to be implemented by Council decisions can only cover matters defined by Article 153 of the Treaty, certain provisions of the Convention relating to flag State responsibilities for the enforcement of the Convention could not be part of the social agreement implemented by Directive 2009/13/EC. Those provisions should be integrated into Union law by virtue of this Directive. This proposal is closely associated with the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2009/16/EC on port State control. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a full public consultation offered an opportunity for Member States and stakeholders to express their views in June 2011. There was a general consensus on the need for updating the legislation related to flag State and port State in order to enforce the MLC requirements. The specific positive effects which were underlined consisted of reinforcing maritime safety, improving quality shipping, making the conditions of competition fairer between EU and non EU operators and between EU and non EU flags. Stakeholders also mentioned the better job quality for all seafarers. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) TFEU. CONTENT: the national flag constitutes the primary source of State responsibility for a ship. Flag States are required to ensure that their ships comply with the standards accepted by flag States under international law and conventions, in particular with international minimum standards. Directive 2009/21/EC seeks to ensure that the flag of all EU Member States have good standing (not being blacklisted…) and to incorporate the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)'s flag State audit scheme into EU law and to introduce the quality certification of the national maritime authorities. This proposal has different purposes. It does not refer to any IMO procedures but lays down principles to monitor the application of Directive 2009/13/EC taking up some of the Maritime Labour Convention standards. For the sake of clarity, it is preferable to have a separate text. In concrete terms, the proposal: · aims to ensure that the EU flag States meet their responsibilities in applying and enforcing Directive 2009/13/EC ; · refers to the definition of “ship” and “shipowner” based on the MLC definition and used in Directive 2009/13 to avoid any discrepancy between the standards and the implementation measures ; · lays down the obligation for flag State to establish mechanisms for inspection and to ensure the compliance of its ships with Directive 2009/13/EC ; · refers to professional qualifications and independence of staff in charge of verification so that the matters covered by Directive 2009/13/EC are rightly applied on board vessels flying the flags of the Member States concerned; · deals with the complaints on board EU flagged ships and lays down the principles and procedure to be followed by the flag States competent staff. Further to Joint Political Declarations, the Commission is now considering the need for explanatory documents on a case-by-case basis. By virtue of the principle of proportionality, explanatory documents have not been deemed justified in the present proposal since the proposal modifies only a limited number of legal obligations of an existing directive. Thus, the present proposal does not include the recital on explanatory documents. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Recreational Craft Directive 94/25/EC  was adopted in 1994 to regulate the placing on the market of pleasure boats on the European market. It was amended by Directive 2003/44/EC which introduces a set of limit values for exhaust emissions for propulsion engines and noise levels for watercrafts with propulsion engines, for both the compression ignition (CI) engines and the spark ignition (SI) engines. Furthermore, it enlarges the scope of the Recreational Craft Directive to cover also personal watercraft. The same amending Directive provides a review clause which aims at reinforcing emission limits to reflect the technological progress of recreational marine engines as well as the need to harmonise the limits worldwide, particularly with the US. At the same time the vulnerable position of the SMEs should be taken into account as this sector consists mainly of small and medium enterprises (more than 95% of businesses are SMEs). The Commission issued a report in 2007 in which it announced that it would assess options to further reducing the exhaust emission limits of recreational marine engines. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focuses on the following three areas of the revision having substantial impacts: A. Exhaust emission limits for engines Option 1 - No change (existing exhaust emissions are maintained). Option 2 - Stricter exhaust emission limits (Stage II) : in the context of this option, the scenario harmonises the limits with the US for both: Spark ignition (SI) engines and compression ignition (CI) engines. Option 3 - Stricter exhaust emission limits (Stage II) combined with mitigating measures to limit negative economic/social effects: Sub-option 3.1 – Use of a flexibility scheme. Sub-option 3.2 – Use of a transitional period for all engine manufacturers (3 years). Sub-option 3.3 – Use of a transitional period for all engine manufacturers + a specific transitional period for small and medium sized engine manufacturers placing on the EU market the SI outboard engines < 15 kW (3+3 years). T his last sub-option was selected in the impact assessment as the preferable option. B. Noise emission limits for watercrafts with propulsion engines. Option 1 - No change (existing noise emission limits are maintained). Option 2 – Stricter noise emission limits.  Option 1 (keeping the current limit values) was found to be the preferred option. C. Alignment of the RCD with the New Legislative Framework : the Commission is engaged to align the sectorial legislation to the new legislative framework, the impact assessment concentrated in analysing the impacts of the alignment only. These impacts should be mostly positive, since the horizontal provisions are clarifying certain issues which are subject to uncertainty for the moment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main elements of the proposed revision are as follows: Clarifying scope and concepts of the Directive : in the past, there have been debates about the content of the term “recreational craft” in the Directive which has been sometimes claimed to be an overall term covering both recreational craft and personal watercraft. This lack of clarity is now eliminated by introducing into the definitions a new overall concept “watercraft” which covers both recreational craft and personal watercraft. For reasons of consistency and clarification it is also specified that only personal watercraft intended for sports and leisure is included in the Directive, and not for instance personal watercraft intended for rescue and police services. General safety requirement : i t is necessary to specify explicitly that that products covered by this Directive may only be placed on the market or put into service if they meet the general requirement imposing them to be without danger to the safety and health of persons, property or environment and only if they meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I. Exhaust emissions : new stricter limits are foreseen for the exhaust emission of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Hydrocarbons (HC) and the Particulates (PT). For CI engines these limits are set applying the US EPA standards for marine diesel recreational engines (40 CFR Part 1042). For SI engines, the limits are set using the US EPA emission standards for new non-road SI engines, equipment and vessels (40 CFR Part 1045). A general three years transitional period for the industry is foreseen. In addition, as regards exhaust emission requirements, a supplementary 3 years is granted to SME engine manufacturers who place on the market the SI engines below 15 kW. Constructional requirements : a new requirement is foreseen to impose mandatory installation of holding tanks to watercraft fitted with toilets in order to contribute to the marine environmental protection. Post construction assessment and private importer : Directive 94/25/EC contains rules on the post construction assessment of recreational craft which is carried out by any natural or legal person established within the Community who places the product on the market in cases, where neither the manufacturer, nor his authorized representative fulfils the responsibilities for evaluating the conformity of products to the Directive. For consistency, it is appropriate to extent the scope of this procedure to cover not only recreational craft but also personal watercraft. For clarity, it must be specified by whom and in which situations exactly this procedure can be used. These are: private importer, that is a natural or legal person who imports in the course of non-commercial activity a product from a third country into the Union with the intention of putting it into service for his own use; any person placing on the market or putting into service an engine or a watercraft after a major modification or conversion thereof or any person changing the intended purpose of a watercraft not covered by the scope this Directive in a way that it falls under its scope; any person placing on the market a watercraft built for own use before the end of the 5 year period. As regards importing recreational craft and personal watercraft, it should be noted that compared to Directive 94/25/EC, the use of Post construction assessments is restricted to cases of non commercial import by private importers. In order to ensure a reliable assessment of the conformity of the product by the notified body with regard to the post construction assessment, there is a need to widen the obligations of the person asking for the post construction assessment to provide documents to the notified body. It is foreseen that he has to provide all the documents necessary for the assessment of the conformity of the product. Affixing of the CE-marking :t he CE marking must be affixed on the watercraft, engines and components. In case of components, where that are not possible or not warranted on account of the size or nature of that product, it can alternatively be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents. Reporting : in order to enforce the monitoring and the efficiency of this Directive, a new obligation is foreseen for the Member States to send every 5 years a report on the application of the Directive to the Commission. Aligning the Recreational Craft Directive with the New Legislative Framework (NLF) and the applicable conformity assessment procedures : c onsequently to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and of Decision 768/2008/EC, the Recreational Craft Directive has to be brought in line with the principles of New Legislative Framework. It means basically the inclusion of the chapters describing the obligations of economic operators, the competences of conformity assessment bodies and market surveillance authorities, new conformity assessment modules and the status of CE marking. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: even if mobility within the European Union of qualified professionals, a Eurobarometer poll in 2010 shows that 28% of EU citizens are considering working abroad. In this context, the recognition of professional qualifications is essential to ensure that European citizens may genuinely benefit from the fundamental freedoms of the internal market and respond to the needs of Member States facing increasing shortages of skilled workers, in particular in sectors such as health, education, construction or business services. The Communication on the Single Market Act identified the recognition of professional qualifications as a major issue. It underlined the need for the modernisation of the existing framework. On 23 October 2011, the European Council invited the Institutions to undertake their utmost to reach a political agreement by the end of 2012 on the 12 initiatives in the Single Market Act, including on a Commission proposal for modernising Directive 2005/36/EC. The European Parliament also called for urgent action in its report dated 15 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment on various policy alternatives. This analysis identified eight groups of problems, deriving mainly from the outcome of the evaluation and from the reactions to the Green Paper. These groups of problems cover: the access to information on recognition procedures, the efficiency of recognition procedures, the functioning of the automatic recognition system, the conditions applying to establishment and those applying to temporary mobility and the scope of the Directive. Since public health emerged as a particular issue during the evaluation, the protection of patients has also been mentioned in the problem definition. The analysis identified three general objectives: facilitating the mobility of professionals and the intra-EU trade in services, addressing the challenge of filling high-skill jobs and offering more possibilities for job seekers. A wide range of options were examined for each group of problems. The main conclusions of the impact assessment relating to each group of problems addressed are published in parallel with this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 46, 53(1), Article 62 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is not proposing a new Directive but a well-targeted modernisation of the existing provisions. The main proposed changes relate to: - The creation of a European Professional Card: to reduce the complexity of procedures, it is proposed to create a European Professional Card (EPC). The EPC will be an alternative tool which can be implemented for those professions which meet several objectives: bottom-up demand by members of the profession, significant mobility and better cooperation between competent authorities through IMI. The EPC also offers potential for those professions interested mainly in temporary mobility. The introduction of the EPC will depend on whether professions request its introduction. The EPC aims to facilitate and accelerate the recognition procedure while at the same time making it more transparent. Therefore, the card requires more involvement by the home Member State, which implies the shift of certain costs and administrative burdens from the host Member State to the home Member State. The use of the Internal Market System becomes compulsory under the Directiv e. Since the successive extensions of IMI to cover all recognition mechanisms under the Directive, a significant number of competent authorities use IMI regularly with good results. Therefore, the proposal obliges Member States to use IMI for the exchange of information relating to recognition of professional qualifications. The use of IMI should reduce costs. The proposal lays down in detail the framework and the rules applicable to the issue of an EPC. The EPC’s advantages include reduced deadlines for the treatment of an application on the basis of the European professional card compared to the current procedure which will continue to exist for professionals preferring not to use the EPC. - Reforming the general rules for establishing in another Member State or moving on a temporary basis: a special regime for the free provision of services on a temporary basis was introduced through Directive 2005/36/EC. It foresees lighter rules for temporary service providers: they can provide services without the prior check of professional qualifications (except for professions with health and safety implications). Several amendments are proposed in this context. By removing the professional experience requirement imposed on service providers from non-regulating Member States when the service provider accompanies the service recipient, the proposal seeks to better cater to the needs of consumers crossing borders. Where the requirement of professional experience still applies, the proposal foresees that it can be acquired in one or several Member States which creates more opportunities for the services providers compared to the current situation. For professions with health and safety implications, Member States implemented the prior check of qualifications in diverse ways which has led to legal uncertainty for service providers. The proposal addresses this issue by requiring Member States not only to provide a list of all professions they consider as belonging to this category but also to justify their reasons for the inclusion of each profession. The proposal also clarifies the list of documents a Member State may require prior to the first provision of services. Two additional changes are proposed: general system : the revision concerns the existing possibility to exclude on the basis of Article 11 certain qualifications from the scope of the Directive when there are two ore more levels of difference between the professionals' training and the requirements in the host Member State. The qualification levels should, in principle, be used only as a benchmarking tool and not as a basis for excluding professionals from the scope of the Directive. The only exception relates to persons whose qualifications are based on professional experience who are seeking access to a profession requiring a university degree; partial access : it is also proposed to introduce the concept of partial access into the Directive. This will bring more legal certainty for professionals and will allow professionals fulfilling the conditions for partial access to establish themselves or to provide services where they were previously excluded from the benefits of the Directive. However, Member States may not apply this principle where there are overriding reasons such as in the case of health professions. - Modernising the system of automatic recognition: the proposed change in this field aims at introducing more flexibility for the Commission to adapt the list of activities contained in Annex IV of this Directive. This list no longer reflects the current structure of economic activities. As regards automatic recognition based on minimum training requirements, in order to improve transparency at EU level, the proposal requires each Member State to notify the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions related to the issuing of new or changed qualifications. Member States will also be obliged to involve an appropriate existing authority or body, such as an accreditation board or a ministry, to report about the compliance of the qualification with the Directive's minimum training requirements. The proposal also includes: new provisions to enhance the mobility of doctors (in particular specialists), nurses, architects and pharmacists; a series of common training principles : a common training framework or common training tests. These aim at introducing more automaticity in the recognition of qualifications currently covered by the general system and should better respond to the needs of the professions. The qualifications obtained under this regime should be automatically recognised in the Member States which might however benefit from derogations in applying them. In addition, the conditions for setting up common training principles are less difficult to fulfil than the conditions for setting up common platforms. - Offering a legal framework in the Directive for partially qualified professionals and for notaries: the proposal extends the scope of the Directive to professionals who hold a diploma but have yet to complete a remunerated traineeship which might be required under the law of the Member State where they graduated (this can apply, for example, to lawyers, architects and teachers). Furthermore, in response to a Court of Justice decision that nationality requirements cannot be imposed on notaries, the scope of the directive needs therefore to be clarified. Considering the specificities of the profession, the rules on establishment and free provision of services have to be well tailored. - Clarifying safeguards for patients: the checking of language knowledge is to take place only after the host Member State has recognised the qualification. In the case of health professionals, it also specifies that it is up to the national health care systems and patient organizations to check whether competent authorities should carry out language controls where strictly necessary; national competent authorities are obliged to alert each other in case a health professional benefiting from automatic recognition under the Directive is prohibited, even temporarily, to practice the profession. - Access to information on rules applicable to recognition of qualifications: to allow an easy identification of the competent authority and the required documents for a recognition request, the proposal foresees that the points of single contact, created under the Services Directive, become central online access points for all professions covered by the Professional Qualifications Directive. Therefore, the scope of the points of single contact is extended to categories of professionals not covered by the Services Directive (health professionals and job seekers). - Launching a systematic screening and mutual evaluation exercise for all regulated professions in the Member States: lastly, the proposal provides for the introduction of an obligation for Member States to notify a list of professions they regulate and to assess their legislation on the access to regulated professions against the principles of necessity (public interest), proportionality and non-discrimination. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal is expected to have implications for the EU budget to the extent that the future EPC will use the IMI System as its operational backbone. The IMI will have to be adapted to the EPC processes and storage requirements and supplemented with some additional functions, namely a specific interface, an alert mechanism and a declaration mechanism. The implications for the EU budget are already covered by planned allocations and will however be modest in view of the fact that using the IMI to underpin the EPC will provide important economies of scale and scope. The adaptation and development costs will therefore be substantially reduced."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal shall provide for the necessary legal framework to respond to the request of the European Council of 23-24 June 2011 to further develop the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) as a matter of priority in order to become operational by 2013, allowing Member States' authorities carrying out border surveillance activities and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), to share operational information and improve cooperation. The aim of EUROSUR is to reinforce the control of the Schengen external borders . EUROSUR will establish a mechanism for Member States' authorities carrying out border surveillance activities to share operational information and to cooperate with each other and with the Agency in order to reduce the loss of lives at sea and the number of irregular immigrants entering the EU undetected, and to increase internal security by preventing cross-border crimes, such as trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of drugs. The works currently carried out for the testing and the gradual establishment of EUROSUR are based on a roadmap presented in a Commission Communication in 2008. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has identified four policy options comprising of sub-options: Option 1 : fully decentralised - with the support of the National Coordination Centres (NCC) ; Option 2 : partly centralised – for the EUROSUR network ; Option 3 : fully centralised approach and including a sub-option ‘Cooperation with third countries”; Option 4 : common applications of surveillance tools at EU level. In line with the impact assessment, the following options would be the preferred ones: with regard to the establishment of NCCs, Option 1.1 is the preferred option, because it does not require Member States to restructure their national administrations and thus could be easily implemented; following the decentralised approach for setting up EUROSUR, the preferred policy option for the EUROSUR network is Option 2.2; taking into account the urgent need for enhancing border control in the Mediterranean region, Option 3.2 provides the best answer on how to promote the cooperation with neighbouring third countries. However, the willingness of northern African countries to cooperate is a precondition for the implementation of Option 3.2. for the common application of surveillance tools, Option 4.2 is the option providing most added value. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77(2)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) according to which the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall adopt measures concerning any measure necessary for the gradual establishment of an integrated management system for external borders. CONTENT: this proposal establishes a common framework for the exchange of information and cooperation between Member States and the Agency in order to improve the situational awareness and reaction capability at the external borders of the Member States and of the European Union, the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR). The purpose of the legislative proposal is to improve the situational awareness and reaction capability of Member States and the Agency when preventing irregular migration and cross-border crime at the external land and maritime borders. Common framework : a common framework shall be established with clear responsibilities and competencies for the national coordination centres (NCC) for border surveillance in the Member States and the Agency, which form the backbone of EUROSUR. These centres, which shall ensure an effective and efficient management of resources and personnel at national level, and the Agency shall communicate with each other via the communication network, which would allow to exchange both non-classified sensitive as well as classified information. For the exchange of information and cooperation in the field of border surveillance, Member States and the Agency shall use the framework of EUROSUR, consisting of the following components: (i) national coordination centres for border surveillance; (ii) national situational pictures; (iii) communication network; (iv) European situational picture; (v) common pre-frontier intelligence picture; (vi) common application of surveillance tools. The proposal also outlines the objectives of: Situational pictures : the cooperation and information exchange between the national coordination centres and the Agency is done via 'situational pictures', which shall be established at national and European level as well as for the pre-frontier area. These three pictures, of which the two latter shall be managed by the Agency, are structured in a similar way to facilitate the flow of information among them. The situational pictures will as a general rule not involve personal data but rather the exchange of information on incidents and depersonalised objects, such as the detection and tracking of vessels. In exceptional cases personal data may form part of the data shared by Member States with the Agency provided that the conditions of Frontex Regulation are met. To the extent personal data forms part of the national situational picture of neighbouring external border sections, it may be exchanged between neighbouring Member States only, under the conditions set by the horizontal EU legal framework on data protection; Surveillance tools : the Agency shall provide a service for the common application of surveillance tools, taking into account that such a service can be provided more cost-efficiently at European level. Such a service could be implemented with the support of relevant European space programmes, including the operational Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). The approach chosen in EUROSUR is to make best use of existing information, capabilities and systems available in other EU agencies to the extent possible. For this reason, the Agency would closely cooperate with the EU Satellite Centre, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency in providing the service for the common application of surveillance tools as well as with EUROPOL in order to exchange information on cross-border crime. With regard to maritime traffic data to be provided by the SafeSeaNet system under Directive 2002/59/EC, the Commission intends to make an appropriate proposal modifying the Directive in 2013. It is envisaged that the relevant information in SafeSeaNet will also be made available for purposes other than those related to maritime safety, maritime security and marine environment protection and thereby be part of the surveillance tools used in the EUROSUR framework. Reaction capacity : better awareness of what is going on at the external borders is only of limited value if it is not complemented by an improved capability of EU Member States to react to challenges faced at their external borders. For this reason, Member States shall divide their external borders into borders sections, to which – based on risk analysis and the number of incidents occuring – impact levels shall be attributed. Depending on which impact levels have been attributed, the national coordination centres and the Agency shall take counter-measures in order to lower the impact on the border section in question. Cooperation with third countries : exisiting and planned regional networks set up between Member States and neighbouring third countries shall be linked to EUROSUR via the national coordination centres. Implementation : taking into account that Member States and the Agency are already in the process of setting up the different components of EUROSUR at national and European level, EUROSUR should become operational in the second half of 2013. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission should provide the Agency with technical support on the further technical development of EUROSUR. Monitoring and evaluation : t he Agency shall submit a report on the functioning of EUROSUR on 1 October 2015 and every two years thereafter. The Commission shall provide an overall evaluation of EUROSUR to the European Parliament and the Council on 1 October 2016 and every four years thereafter. Fundamental rights and data protection requirements : this proposal was subjected to scrutiny to ensure that its provisions are fully compatible with fundamental rights and notably human dignity, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, right to liberty and security, right to the protection of personal data, non-refoulement, non-discrimination and rights of the child. Particular attention was paid to Articles 4 and 19(2) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which prohibit removal of persons to a State where there is a serious risk of death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The draft Regulation explicitly prohibits any exchange of information with a third country that could use this information to identify persons or groups of persons who are under a serious risk of being subjected to torture, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment or any other violation of fundamental rights. It explicitly provides that Member States and the Agency shall give priority to the special needs of children, victims of trafficking, persons in need of urgent medical assistance, persons in need of international protection, persons in distress at sea and other persons in a particularly vulnerable situation. The protection of personal data is also of particular importance as data sharing may include personal data, in which situation the data protection rules apply and must be fully respected. Territorial provisions : this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis, in which the United Kingdom and Ireland are not participating but which applies to 4 associated countries (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the different components of EUROSUR will be mainly implemented by the Agency and by Member States (shared management) on the basis of the 2008 EUROSUR roadmap: with regard to setting up the national coordination centres, Member States will be supported by the External Borders Fund in 2012-2013 and the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the planned Internal Security Fund in 2014-2020; the Agency will use its own budget to set up the communication network and other horizontal components of EUROSUR, such as the European situational picture and the common pre-frontier intelligence picture, and when necessary this is completed by support under the Internal Security Fund (direct or indirect centralised financial management); funding provided under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development will support the setting up of the envisaged service for the common application of surveillance tools in 2012-2013; measures in neighbouring third countries will be supported in 2012-2013 by the Thematic Programme for Asylum and Migration, as part of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The impact assessment provides a financial envelope of EUR 338.7 million from 2011 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC prohibits the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators, including those incorporated into appliances, that contain more than 0.002% of cadmium by weight therein. However, the portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools have been exempt from that ban. The Commission has reviewed that exemption with a view to the prohibition of cadmium in batteries and accumulators. That review led to the conclusion that, in order to gradually diminish the amount of cadmium released to the environment, the prohibition of the use of cadmium should be extended to portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools as suitable cadmium-free substitutes for these applications are available on the market, namely nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion battery technologies IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission's impact assessment concludes that compared to the baseline scenario the other policy options related to a withdrawal of the exemption (immediate withdrawal or withdrawal in 2016) would lead to a lower overall environmental impact, both in terms of avoiding releases of cadmium to the environment and in terms of aggregated environmental impacts based on six environmental indicators. The impact assessment concludes that if the exemption is withdrawn in 2016, the environmental benefits would be slightly lower than in the case of immediate withdrawal but the costs would be much lower compared to an immediate withdrawal. Over the period 2013-2025, a cordless power tools with alternative battery chemistry will, depending on the alternative battery chemistry chosen (nickel metal hydride or lithium-ion), cost EUR 0.8 and EUR 2.1 more respectively if the exemption is immediately withdrawn and an additional EUR 0.4 and EUR 0.9 respectively in the case of withdrawal in 2016. As withdrawal of the exemption in 2016 would have almost the same level of effectiveness at a higher efficiency compared to an immediate withdrawal, this option is the preferred one. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 2006/66/EC by limiting the exemption for the use of cadmium in portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools to 1 January 2016. This means that as from this date, the use of cadmium in portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools, included those incorporated into appliances, is restricted to 0.002% of cadmium by weight in line with Directive 2006/66/EC. The proposal identifies the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Directive 2006/66/EC and establishes the corresponding procedures for adoption of these acts in accordance with Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. |DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2000, the Union grants unlimited duty free access to the Union market for almost all products originating in the Western Balkans. Currently, this system is provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process. All the Western Balkans countries benefit from preferential trade arrangements, including individual tariff quotas, under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or Interim Agreements on trade and trade-related matters concluded with these countries, with the exception of Kosovo. Kosovo has no Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and can only benefit of the general tariff quota. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed to allocate a specific tariff quota of 20.000 hl to Kosovo, which is deducted from the global quota of 50.000 hl provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, hence reduced to 30.000 hl. This is achieved by closing the current tariff quota and establishing two new ones for the said amounts. A mechanism is foreseen which eliminates the legal uncertainties deriving from the fact that the quotas are allocated on a “first come–first served” basis, and that the date of entry into force of this regulation cannot be anticipated. In order to avoid expanding the overall volume of concessions, the quota reserved for Kosovo is applied on a pro-rata basis. This reallocation does not affect the global volume of concession to the countries in the Western Balkans, and maintains stable wine market conditions in the EU. The specific concessions provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements are also not affected by this proposed Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: drug precursors are chemical substances having a wide variety of licit uses, such as in the synthesis of plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, perfumes, detergents, or aromas. They are traded for legitimate purposes on global markets, but some of them can also be diverted from the licit distribution channels for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs. Taking into account the wide legitimate uses of drug precursors, their trade cannot be prohibited. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are chemical substances used for the manufacture of cold or allergy medicines. These two substances are also the main precursors for the manufacture of methamphetamine. While ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are controlled at international and EU level, the medicinal products containing them are not controlled when they are exported from or transiting through the Union customs territory. They are targeted by drug traffickers as a source of precursors for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine because the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine contained in these products can be easily extracted. Extent of the problem: in 2009, almost 7 400 seizures of methamphetamine, amounting to about 600 kg of the drug, were reported in Europe. Both the number of seizures and quantities increased over 2004-2009. In 2009, illicit methamphetamine laboratories were seized for the first time in several European countries. This is an indication that methamphetamine markets may be expanding in Europe. Seizures of methamphetamine precursors contained in medicinal products have fluctuated considerably from 2007 until 2010. At European level, while in 2007 hardly any preparations were recorded out of the overall quantities seized, in 2008 and 2009 the amount of preparations out of the total quantities seized increased sharply and decreased considerably again in 2010. After the continued increase of seizures of medicinal products from 2007 to 2009, as a result of strengthened controls of medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in several countries, particularly in Mexico and countries in Central America, the total amount of medicinal products seized worldwide decreased in 2010. However, the increasing or decreasing level of seizures is only one indicator to illustrate that illicit manufacture is taking place in a given part of the world. The absence of a control mechanism for medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine remains a concern both at European and at global level. Medicinal products for human use containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine are excluded from the provisions of Regulation (EC) 111/2005, which applies to trade in drug precursors between the EU and third countries. This has led to a situation where these products could not be stopped or seized by Member States' competent authorities when these products were exported from or transiting through the Union customs territory, even though it was very likely that they would be misused for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine in their country of destination. Directive 2011/62/EU which relates to the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of falsified medicinal products addresses the distribution chain for medicines within the EU, importation of active substances, and 'introduction' of medicines, i.e. medicines brought into the customs territory without the intention of placing them on the market. These provisions are focused on preventing products that fall within the definition of falsified medicinal products from entering the legal supply chain. Given that the principal issue with drug precursors is one of legitimately produced products leaving the legal supply chain, it is unlikely that these provisions will make a significant contribution to tackling the issue of controlling medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine being exported or transiting through the EU. The EU is criticised internationally for not taking adequate control measures across Member States to tackle this weakness. By imposing EU control over these medicinal products, this proposal is aiming to make it more difficult, expensive and risky for criminals to source the chemicals they need to manufacture drugs. The proposal should work as a deterrent: it focuses on preventing the diversion of precursors. It concentrates on the supply reduction of the chemicals to make drugs and not on the supply of the drugs for the consumers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment report identified and assessed five policy options: Option 1: ""baseline scenario"": the status quo would be maintained. Option 2: voluntary measures by Member States to improve the situation. Option 3: giving authorities power to stop suspicious shipments. Option 4: giving authorities power to stop suspicious shipments and pre-export notification of legal shipments. Option 5: full control of trade in medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The impact assessment concluded that Option 4 would be the most suitable one to address the problem, as it would: (i) provide for a legal basis, (ii) impose only one extra control requirement and (iii) generate hardly any additional administrative burden. The proposal notes that even though Option 5 could be considered the most effective by applying the strictest controls, the requirements would be disproportionate to the objective pursued by the present initiative. The added value provided by Option 4 compared to Option 3 is that, under the former Option, the synergy of two combined measures increases the effectiveness of each individual measure. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal provides that any export of medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine should be preceded by a pre-export notification sent by the competent authorities in the Union to the competent authorities of the country of destination. The pre-export notification system is up and running and measures are already compulsory for scheduled substances of Category 1. The proposal contains compulsory measures for the products containing Category 1 substances, such as medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Member States' competent authorities will be given the powers to stop or seize those products when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they are intended for the illicit drug manufacture, when they are exported, imported or in transit. At the moment, most customs authorities can only seize ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as raw substances. The European Database on drug precursors created by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 will be used to: ·  simplify Member States’ reporting with regard to seizures and stopped shipments in accordance with Article 12(12) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988; ·  establish a European register of operators holding a licence or a registration, which will facilitate verification of the legitimacy of their transactions involving scheduled substances and enable operators to provide the competent authorities with information about their export, import or intermediary activities involving scheduled substances. The proposal contains some other amendments aiming at facilitating the implementation of the Regulation and at increasing its effectiveness, the main ones being: ·  the possibility of amending the Annex to the Regulation in order to react more quickly to new emerging trends in precursors diversion; ·  a review clause to assess whether the amended Regulation will have been effective to prevent the diversion of medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine; ·  the adaptation of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 in accordance with the rules on delegated and implementing acts under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not have an impact on human resources and on the European Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by a financial statement. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 111/2005, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be delegated to the Commission for specific purposes listed in the text."

BACKGROUND: drug precursors are chemical substances having a wide variety of licit uses, such as in the synthesis of plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, perfumes, detergents, or aromas. They are traded for legitimate purposes on global markets, but some of them can also be diverted from the licit distribution channels for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs. Taking into account the wide legitimate uses of drug precursors, their trade cannot be prohibited. However, in order to prevent their diversion to illicit drug production, a specific regulatory framework has been set up on international level through Article 12 of the United Nations Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The EU is a Party to the Convention and has implemented its obligations through Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 governing the monitoring of the intra-EU trade in drug precursors and Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 governing the external trade. The Union regulatory framework provides for the monitoring and control of the legitimate trade in drug precursors. Operators, i.e. manufacturers, distributors, brokers, importers, exporters and wholesalers of chemicals engaged in the legitimate trade of drug precursors are required to take measures against theft, check their customers, detect suspicious transactions and notify the authorities thereof. In 2010, the European Commission adopted a Report on the implementation and functioning of the existing EU legislation on drug precursors, and recommended analysing ways to strengthen the control of the trade of acetic anhydride (scheduled substance in Category 2) in order to better prevent the diversion of acetic anhydride for the illicit production of heroin. Heroin use accounts for the greatest share of morbidity and mortality-related drug use in the EU. Even though the quantities of acetic anhydride seized in the EU have decreased very substantially since 2008, certain reports consider that the European legislative control measures are not sufficiently strict to prevent the diversion of the main heroin precursor from the intra-EU trade. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main problem driver being the insufficient control by competent authorities over all economic players involved in the legitimate trade with drug precursors, all policy options examined seek to improve control via enhanced reporting, notification or registration obligations imposed on the economic players. The impacts of the following six policy options have been analysed: Option 1 (baseline option): no action: the current EU legislation will remain unchanged; Option 2: strengthened reporting obligations; Option 3: strengthened rules and obligations on operators related to customer declarations from end-users; Option 4: require operators to systematically notify new end-users to the authorities to allow verification; Option 5: require registration for end-users and reinforce requirements regarding registration; Option 6: move acetic anhydride from category 2 to category 1 scheduled substances. Option 5 is the preferred option. The overall conclusion of the impact assessment was that both, Option 4 and Option 5 would be good choices, but Option 5 would be less burdensome than Option 4 in terms of annual costs for enterprises (provided authorities do not pass on all costs to registrants by imposing fees), an argument which is particular relevant for SMEs. All in all the strong political support which Option 5 has from most Member States, combined with views expressed on international level that a more systematic control of (all) acetic anhydride end-users is lacking in the European legislation, and the somewhat lower burden on SMEs tip the balance in favour of Option 5. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal aims to address a specific weakness which has been detected in the European Union, when large quantities of acetic anhydride (""AA""), the main drug precursor for heroin, were diverted from the EU- internal trade: in 2008, 75% of the global seizures of Acetic anhydride happened in the EU. Until now only EU companies producing or trading Acetic anhydride have to register with their national authorities. The Commission proposes to: · extend the registration requirement , which so far applies only to operators placing Acetic anhydride on the market, to include users of the substance; · enhance the harmonised registration provisions to achieve a more robust level playing field preserving the internal market and avoiding adoption of divergent national measures. More detailed rules on registration are introduced to ensure uniform conditions of registration in all Member States for scheduled substances in category 2 of Annex I. For substances scheduled in a new subcategory 2A of Annex I, not only operators but also users will be subject to a registration requirement. By ensuring that operators and users engaged in the legal trade of drug precursors are subject to harmonised rules, the proposal will ensure a proper functioning of the Union market by avoiding unnecessary barriers to such legitimate trade and by reducing administrative burdens for operators and competent authorities. Additionally the Commission proposes to establish and maintain a European Database on Drug Precursors in order to modernize the collection of the information provided by Member States on drug precursor seizures and stopped shipments, in accordance with current Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 273/2004, and to maintain a list of EU licensed or registered operators and users legally trading or using drug precursors, as well as to enable operators to provide competent authorities in summary form with information about their transactions involving scheduled substances in accordance with current Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 273/2004. In addition, it should be noted that the proposal is: · subject to a notification to the WTO in the framework of the TBT Agreement; · relevant for the European Economic Area (EEA); · contains a transitional period for the coming into force of the new registration obligations for end-users of Acetic anhydride; · includes a review clause to assess whether the amended Regulation will have been effective to prevent the diversion of Acetic anhydride. Annex: the proposal does not extend the provisions for acetic anhydride to other scheduled substances in category 2. Acetic anhydride, currently scheduled in category 2 of Annex I, will be included in a new subcategory 2A of Annex I to allow increased control of its trade. The remaining substances of category 2 will be listed as subcategory 2B. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the European Union budget because no additional resources are required to implement the action proposed.

PROPOSED ACT: the context of this proposal is fourfold. 1. Despite progress in some areas, major environmental challenges remain, as well as opportunities to make the environment more resilient to systemic risks and change. 2. The EU has adopted the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, which guides policy development for the period up to 2020. 3. While many Member States are struggling to cope with the economic crisis, the need for structural reforms offers new opportunities for the EU to move towards an inclusive green economy. 4. Rio+20 highlighted the importance of the global dimension. Environment Action Programmes (EAP) have guided the development of EU environment policy since the early 1970s. The 6th EAP expired in July 2012. The final assessment of 6th EAP concluded that the programme delivered benefits for the environment and provided an overarching strategic direction for environment policy. Despite those achievements, unsustainable trends still persist in all four priority areas identified in the 6th EAP: (i) climate change, (ii) biodiversity, (iii) environment and health, and (iv) sustainable use of natural resources and management of waste. The Commission sees it as essential that Union priority objectives for 2020 are established, in light of a long-term vision for 2050. The new programme should build on policy initiatives in the Europe 2020 strategy, including the EU climate and energy package, the Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050, the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the Roadmap to a resource-efficient Europe and the Innovation Union Flagship Initiative. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment found that the proposal would add value in a number of ways: (i) by providing a strategic framework for environmental policy in the EU; (ii) by ensuring complementarity and coherence; (iii) by ensuring predictability and a level playing field; and (iv) by stimulating action at all levels of governance. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the new EAP aims to step up the contribution of environment policy to the transition towards a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy in which natural capital is protected and enhanced, and the health and well-being of citizens is safeguarded. The programme provides an overarching framework for environment policy to 2020, identifying nine priority objectives for the EU and its Member States to attain: to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital; to turn the Union into a resource-efficient, green and competitive low-carbon economy; to safeguard the Union's citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and wellbeing; to maximise the benefits of the Union's environment legislation; to improve the evidence base for environment policy; to secure investment for environment and climate policy and get the prices right; to improve environmental integration and policy coherence; to enhance the sustainability of the Union's cities; to increase the Union’s effectiveness in confronting regional and global environmental challenges. The programme shall be based on the polluter-pays principle, the precautionary principle and preventive action, and the principle of rectification of pollution at source. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the programme in this proposal for a Decision has been developed in line with the Commission proposal for the EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the planning, development and operation of trans-European transport networks contribute to the attainment of major Union objectives, such as the smooth functioning of the internal market and the strengthening of economic and social cohesion and also have the specific objectives of allowing the seamless and sustainable mobility of persons and goods and ensuring accessibility for all regions of the Union. These specific objectives should be achieved by establishing interconnections and interoperability between national transport networks in a resource-efficient way. Growth in traffic has resulted in increased congestion on international transport corridors. In order to ensure the international mobility of goods and passengers, the capacity of the trans-European transport network and the use of this capacity should be optimised and, if necessary, expanded by removing infrastructure bottlenecks and bridging missing infrastructure links within and between Member States. Five main problems need to be tackled at EU level: (1) missing links, in particular at cross-border sections, are a major obstacle to the free movement of goods and passengers within and between the Member States and with its neighbours; (2) a considerable and enduring disparity in quality and availability of infrastructure between and within the Member States (bottlenecks); (3) transport infrastructure between the transport modes is fragmented; (4) investments in transport infrastructures should contribute to achieve the goals of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in transport by 60% by 2050; (5) Member States still maintain different operational rules and requirements, in particular in the field of interoperability, which add to the transport infrastructure barriers and bottlenecks. These new guidelines, which will replace Decision 661/2010/EU, seek to establish a complete and integrated trans-European transport network , covering all Member States and regions and providing the basis for the balanced development of all transport modes in order to facilitate their respective advantages, thereby maximising the value added for Europe of the network. In the light of the challenges for the TEN-T policy, also identified by the White Paper “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system”, these Guidelines will define a long-term strategy for the TEN-T policy up to 2030/2050. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t he Impact Assessment identifies four specific objectives for addressing the problem of a fragmented network. This involves, on the one hand, enhanced coordination in EU planning and the designing of a sound governance structure to secure implementation of an optimal network configuration. Two policy options were the result: option 1 , combining a planning approach largely based on the current policy, though with certain amendments in the light of the experience gained, with a reinforced coordination approach to implementation; option 2 , combining a stronger approach to planning coordination, through identification of an optimised configuration for the strategic ""core"" of the TEN-T, with the same reinforced coordination approach to implementation. The Commission considers that this second option, because of the stronger coordination at both planning and implementation levels, would have an overall higher impact. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation will repeal and replace Decision 661/2010/EU on Union guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network. This proposal aims to establish and develop a complete TEN-T, consisting of infrastructure for railways, inland waterways, roads, maritime and air transport, thereby ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and strengthening economic and social cohesion. To achieve these objectives, two fields of action are envisaged: - the first field of action is ""conceptual planning"": the gradual implementation of the TEN-T network by means of a dual-layer approach, consisting of a comprehensive network and a core network. The comprehensive network constitutes the basic layer of the TEN-T. It consists of all existing and planned infrastructure meeting the requirements of the Guidelines. The comprehensive network is to be in place by 31 December 2050 at the latest. The core network overlays the comprehensive network and consists of its strategically most important parts. It constitutes the backbone of the multi-modal mobility network. It concentrates on those components of TEN-T with the highest European added value: cross border missing links, key bottlenecks and multi-modal nodes. The core network is to be in place by 31 December 2030 at the latest. - the second field of action concerns the implementation instruments. The Commission has developed the concept of core network corridors, taking due account of the rail freight corridors. These corridors will provide the framework instrument for the coordinated implementation of the core network. In terms of scope, the core network corridors will in principle cover three transport modes and cross at least three Member States. If possible, they should establish a connection with a maritime port. In terms of activities, the core network corridors will provide a platform for capacity management, investments, building and coordinating multi-modal transhipment facilities, and deploying interoperable traffic management systems. The proposal includes the following key aspects: Guidelines : the Guidelines set the framework for identifying projects of common interest. These projects contribute to the development and establishment of TEN-T through the creation, maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading of infrastructure, through measures to promote the resource-efficient use of infrastructure and by enabling sustainable and efficient freight transport services. With a view to cooperation with third and neighbouring countries , the European Union may promote projects of mutual interest. The comprehensive network is specified by: infrastructure requirements; priorities for promoting projects of common interest. freight terminals, passenger stations, inland ports, maritime ports and airports will connect transport modes in order to allow multi-modal transport; urban nodes form key elements in the comprehensive network as connecting points between the different transport infrastructures. Core network : the guidelines lay down specific requirements for the core network, in addition to the requirements for the comprehensive network, for example availability of alternative fuels. The Commission will monitor and evaluate the progress made in implementing the core network; core network corridors are an instrument for implementing the core network. They are to be based on modal integration and interoperability and lead to coordinated development and management; European Coordinators will facilitate the coordinated implementation of the corridors, in cooperation with corridor platforms to be established by Member States concerned; ach corridor platform will establish a multi-annual development plan, including investment and implementation plans, as a management structure. Based on this information the Commission will adopt implementing acts (decisions) for each corridor. Lastly, the proposal calls for regular revision of the annexes by means of delegated acts in order to update the maps of the comprehensive network. It also envisages a review of the core network by 2023. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal will not entail any additional cost for the EU budget. It should be noted that in the context of the Communication on the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020, the Commission has announced the creation of a new instrument at EU level, the ''Connecting Europe Facility"", which will finance EU priority infrastructure in transport, energy and digital broadband. The facility will have a single fund of EUR 50 billion for the period 2014-2020, of which EUR 31.7 billion will be allocated to transport, out of which €10 billion will be ring fenced for related transport infrastructures investments inside the Member States eligible under the Cohesion Fund. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions enabling the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: as a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the powers conferred upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the TFEU. The Commission has committed itself, with regard to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers16, to reviewing legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny in the light of the criteria laid down in the Treaty. The overall objective is by the end of Parliament's seventh term (June 2014), to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to modify nine legislative acts in the domain of agricultural and fishery statistics in order to align them with the new institutional context. In particular, the aim is to identify what powers the Commission has and establish the appropriate procedure for adopting measures on the basis of these powers. Another aspect of the proposal is the streamlining of the European Statistical System (ESS). It is recalled that the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC), established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, is regarded as the umbrella committee within the ESS. It assists the Commission in exercising of its implementing powers in certain statistical domains. These exclude agricultural and fishery statistics where the Commission is assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics (SCAS) . The Commission is proposing a new ESS structure aimed at improving coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, with the ESSC as highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. The suggestion is therefore to modify the nine legislative acts in order to replace the reference to the SCAS by a reference to the ESSC. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 defines the framework for the public governance and financing of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. In particular, it allocates EUR 3405 million for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. As provided for in the Regulation, the Commission adopted a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the mid-term review of the European satellite navigation programmes on 18 January 2011. As a result of this report, the Council, among other things, expressed its support once again for the European satellite navigation programmes as defined in Regulation (EC) No 683/2008. It also noted the overall cost estimates and the fact that the Commission would submit a proposal including changes to the governance model with a view to the next multiannual financial framework. For its part, in its resolution adopted on 8 June 2011, the Parliament also restated its support for the European satellite navigation programmes and considered that it should be principally funded by the Union budget. It asked the Commission to submit legislative proposals quickly with particular emphasis on the need to provide a long-term, stable framework, in particular for operation of the systems. In its Communication dated 29 June 2011, accompanied by a proposal for a Council Regulation of the same date, the Commission proposed to assign EUR 7 000 million to the financing of the European satellite navigation programmes during the next multiannual financial framework for the 2014-2020 period. Nevertheless, it indicated here that it is necessary to maintain efforts to control costs and that new management procedures should be planned for the long-term. It should be noted that this sum of EUR 7 000 million, at 2011 constant prices, is an absolute ceiling and corresponds to a sum of EUR 7 897 million at current prices. The Commission recalls that it should be borne in mind that the Galileo and EGNOS programmes are flagship projects of the Union and fit in perfectly with the Europe 2020 strategy and policies for sustainable development. It should also be emphasised that the European satellite navigation programmes does not only concern the Member States with the greatest involvement in the space field: they concern all the Member States of the Union directly. As part of Europe 2020's f lagship initiative 'An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era' the Commission is responsible for developing an effective space policy to provide the tools to address some of the key global challenges and in particular to deliver Galileo. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on the continued implementation of the programmes and on two particular key problems: i) firstly, the configuration of future services, given that the budget allocated for the period 2008-2013 is insufficient to complete the infrastructure of the system established under the Galileo programme and to ensure the operation of EGNOS; and ii) the definition of the operational governance model and the financing required. concerning the system established under the Galileo programme, evaluation of the various options has shown that the best option is to retain the services initially specified, with the exception of the (Safety of Life) SoL service. This solution, which requires less infrastructure on the ground, reduces the costs; with regard to EGNOS, the system is already operational and many users are enjoying its benefits. In addition, when the SoL service was declared operational, the Commission gave assurances regarding the continuity of this service to users who went on to make significant investments. Ending the EGNOS programme is not an option in this context. On the second point , the impact assessment concluded that the Commission, representing the Union, should remain responsible for the programmes while the Union continues to ensure their funding alone, as proposed by the Commission. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The proposed Regulation meets the requests of the Parliament and the Council while taking into account the contents of the Commission Communication of 29 June 2011. It is the basic act for European satellite navigation programmes for the period covered by the next multiannual financial framework, providing in particular for funding and the governance model for the programmes. Given the magnitude of the changes to be made to Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, it was deemed necessary to propose that it be replaced with a new Regulation rather than amended. The Commission proposes to earmark EUR 7 000 million (EUR 7 897 million in current prices) to guarantee the completion of the EU satellite navigation infrastructure and to ensure the exploitation of the systems until 2020, such as the operations of the space and terrestrial infrastructures, the necessary replenishment/replacement activities, certification procedures, and notably the provision of services. The proposal also recalls that the Union remains the owner of the systems. Therefore the management of the programmes' exploitation should be delegated to the European GNSS Agency while management of the programmes' deployment should be delegated to the European Space Agency. In order to enable the European Parliament and the Council to gain a full picture of the conditions under which the European GNSS Agency would be obliged to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under the new governance model, particularly concerning resources, the Commission will submit a proposal in 2012 for the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 and of the associated financial statement. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Union will continue to finance the Galileo and EGNOS programmes alone. Its contribution to the programmes for the period 2014-2020 shall not exceed EUR 7 897 million at current prices. It covers three main activities, namely, completion of the deployment phase of the Galileo programme, the exploitation phase of the same programme and operation of the EGNOS system. The latter includes ongoing improvement of the services provided by the system in order to meet the changing needs of users. Retaining the expertise acquired within the Commission is an essential factor in ensuring the continuity of the programmes. Consequently, the Commission will retain temporary agents currently in employment for periods to be determined in accordance with the various phases of the programmes and will transfer personnel to the European GNSS Agency. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2011, Jordan's economy has been significantly affected by the domestic events related to the Arab Spring and the ongoing regional unrest. Combined with a weaker global environment, the political transition of Jordan has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. Jordan has also been affected by the intensification of the Syria crisis, notably through the inflow of refugees and its fiscal implications ( about 1000 Syrians crossing Jordanian borders every day). It has welcomed about 180 000 refugees since January 2013. While Jordan has so far managed to date to maintain macroeconomic stability, including through substantial fiscal consolidation efforts and financial support from foreign donors, there are significant balance of payments and financing needs. Under the pressure of a sharp drop of international reserves in the first half of 2012, the Jordanian authorities have agreed on a USD 2 billion (800% of quota), 36-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund, approved on August 2012. In this context, the Jordanian government requested Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU in the amount of EUR 200 million in December 2012. Consequently, the Commission presents this proposal for MFA to the benefit of Jordan amounting to a maximum of EUR 180 million in the form of loans. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed that the Union shall make available to Jordan macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 180 million, with a view to supporting Jordan's economic stabilisation and reforms. The assistance shall contribute to covering Jordan's balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF programme. The full amount of the macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Jordan in the form of loans which shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. The Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions in order to lend them to Jordan. Objective of the loan : the EU's MFA would contribute towards covering Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2013 and 2014, in the context of the IMF programme. It would help Jordan address the lingering economic consequences of the Arab Spring and the external shocks of its energy sector. It would reduce the economy's short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities, while supporting the adjustment and reform programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the reforms agreed under the EU's budgetary support operations. The proposed assistance would: promote policy measures to improve public financial management and tax reform while strengthening the social safety net (including through a better targeting of the cash transfers system); measures to improve the regulatory framework and climate for investment; and reforms to reduce unemployment and encourage participation in the labour market, notably among women. Release measures : the Commission: shall manage the provision of the assistance in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Jordan and with the key principles and objectives of economic reforms set out in the EU-Jordan Association Agreement and the EU-Jordan Action Plan for 2010-2015 agreed under the European Neighbourhood Policy; shall regularly inform the European Parliament and the Economic and Financial Committee of developments in the management of the Union macro-financial assistance and provide them with relevant documents. The Union macro-financial assistance shall be made available for a period of two years from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to the proposal. Other implementing measures : instalments : the assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments and to allow some frontloading given the urgency of the financing needs. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the second half of 2013. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the first half of 2014; disbursement : this assistance is of macroeconomic nature and its design is consistent with the IMF-supported economic programme. The monitoring of the action by the Commission services will take place on the basis of progress in the implementation of the SBA and specific reform measures to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment); management : the assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. Implementing powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The fact that the assistance is of a substantial amount and, therefore, has a potentially important impact, justifies the use of the examination procedure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the MFA would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 04 01 14. Assuming that the first loan disbursement will be made in 2013 for the amount of EUR 100 million and the second loan disbursement in 2014 for the amount of EUR 80 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2015-16 budgets."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: u nemployment and persistently high rates of poverty call for action at EU and national level. Almost 23 million people are today unemployed and over 113 million are estimated to be living at risk of poverty or exclusion. Social and employment issues are a primary concern of European citizens, and an area where more is expected from the Union. Additional challenges that the Union faces relate to: shortfalls in skill levels, under-performance in active labour market policy and education systems, social exclusion of marginalised groups, and low labour mobility. There is a need both for policy initiatives and for concrete supporting actions. The European Social Fund (ESF) supports policies and priorities aiming to achieve progress towards full employment, enhance quality and productivity at work, increase the geographical and occupational mobility of workers within the Union, improve education and training systems, and promote social inclusion, thereby contributing to economic, social and territorial cohesion. As the ESF should be fully aligned with the Europe 2020 Strategy and its headline targets, it  should support the policies pursued by the Member States under the Integrated Guidelines adopted in accordance with the Treaty and the Recommendations on the National Reform Programmes. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment for the ESF Regulation mainly addressed the scope of the instrument and one specific aspect of simplification. It also discussed the articulation between and complementarity with the financial instruments available to the Commission’s Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, notably the ESF, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the PROGRESS programme, EURES and the PROGRESS Microfinance Facility. The ESF is seen as providing considerable European added value and has received very broad support. Concentration on the main challenges and Council Recommendations is widely seen as an important precondition for the effectiveness of support. Reducing the complexity of support and the related audit burden, notably for smaller beneficiaries, is also seen as an important area that needs to be addressed. LEGAL BASIS: Article 164 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the present proposal defines the ESF’s mission and scope for 2014-2020, together with the associated investment priorities addressing the thematic objectives, and lays down specific provisions concerning operational programmes co-financed by the ESF and concerning eligible expenditure. Scope : the draft ESF Regulation for 2014-2020 proposes to target the ESF on four ‘thematic objectives’ throughout the European Union: (i) promoting employment and labour mobility; (ii) investing in education, skills and lifelong learning; (iii) promoting social inclusion and combating poverty; (iv) enhancing institutional capacity and an efficient public administration. Each thematic objective is translated into intervention categories or ‘investment priorities’ . In addition, the ESF should contribute also to other thematic objectives such as supporting the shift towards low-carbon, climate resilient and resource efficient economy, enhancing the use of information and communication technologies, strengthening research, technological development and innovation and enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. Concentration of funding : in order to ensure this concentration, it is proposed that: support for administrative capacity should be limited to Member States with less developed regions or eligible to the Cohesion Fund; at least 20 % of the ESF allocation should be dedicated to ‘promoting social inclusion and combating poverty’; operational programmes should concentrate funding on a limited number of ‘investment priorities’. Gender equality : the draft Regulation clarifies and strengthens the ESF contribution to the Union's commitment to eliminate inequalities between women and men and prevent discrimination. Member States should combine a robust mainstreaming approach and specific actions to promote gender equality and non-discrimination. Social innovation and cooperation : the proposal aims to reinforce social innovation and transnational cooperation under the ESF, through an incentive in the form of a higher co-funding rate for priority axes dedicated to them, specific programming and monitoring arrangements, and a stronger role for the Commission in the exchange and dissemination of good practices, joint actions and results across the Union. Monitoring and evaluation systems : the draft Regulation proposes minimum quality standards and a set of compulsory common indicators. This should ensure that monitoring produces robust and reliable data that can easily be aggregated at EU level and that evaluation focuses on assessing the effectiveness and impact of ESF support. Social partners : for the less-developed regions and countries, the draft Regulation calls for an appropriate amount of ESF resources to be allocated to capacity building actions for social partners and non-governmental organisations. Joint activities undertaken by the social partners will also be supported, considering their vital role in the field of employment, education and social inclusion. Small beneficiaries : the draft Regulation proposes a limited number of specific eligibility rules to facilitate access to ESF funding for smaller beneficiaries and operations and to take account of the different nature of ESF operations and the different type of ESF beneficiaries as compared to other Funds. In order to ensure that simplification reaches the beneficiaries, the draft Regulation proposes to extend the use of simplified cost options, including by making their use obligatory for smaller operations. These provisions will reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries and managing authorities, strengthen the results orientation of the ESF and will contribute to reducing error rates. Financial instruments : lastly, specific provisions are introduced for financial instruments to encourage Member States and regions to leverage the ESF and thus increase its capacity to finance actions supporting employment, education and social inclusion. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund). The present proposal establishes minimum shares for the ESF for each category of regions defined in the proposal for a General Regulation. This results in a minimum overall share for the ESF of 25 % of the budget allocated to cohesion policy (excluding the allocation to the Connecting Europe Facility), i.e. EUR 84 billion. The indicated minimum ESF allocation includes the budget (EUR 2.5 billion) for a forthcoming Commission proposal regarding food support for the most deprived persons. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission decided that cohesion policy should remain an essential element of the next financial package and underlined its pivotal role in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. It proposed a number of important changes to the way cohesion policy is designed and implemented. Concentrating funding on a smaller number of priorities better linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, focusing on results, monitoring progress towards agreed objectives, increasing the use of conditionalities and simplifying the delivery are among the major hallmarks of the proposal. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union by correcting imbalances between its regions. The ERDF supports regional and local development by co-financing investments in R&D and innovation; climate change and environment; business support to SMEs; services of common economic interest; telecommunication, energy and transport infrastructures; health, education and social infrastructures; and sustainable urban development. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a certain number of options were assessed in particular in relation to the ERDF contribution to two public goods: (i) contribution to employment, R&D and innovation through enterprise support; (ii) investing in basic infrastructure (e.g. transport, energy, environment, social and health infrastructure). The options examined included the status quo, changes to make funding more targeted, and an option which would be significantly more restrictive in scope compared with current funding options. The option of increased targeting was chosen, which increases the efficiency, effectiveness and EU added value of funding, but at the same time leaves regions sufficient flexibility regarding investment, and minimises the risk that activities requiring funding fall outside the scope of intervention. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 178 and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation determines the scope of intervention of the ERDF, and also defines a negative list of activities which will not be eligible for support. It defines investment priorities for each of the thematic objectives. Thematic objectives : transition regions and more developed regions will be required to focus the largest part of their allocation (except for the ESF) on energy efficiency and renewable energy, competitiveness of SMEs, and innovation. Less developed regions will be able to devote their allocation to a wider range of objectives reflecting the broader range of development needs. The mechanism proposed provides that: at least 80% of resources are focused on energy efficiency and renewables, research and innovation and SME support in more developed and transition regions of which 20% for energy efficiency and renewables. Given the ongoing restructuring needs in those regions phasing out from the Convergence objective, the minimum percentage shall be reduced to 60%; at least 50% of resources are focused on energy efficiency and renewables, research and innovation and SME support in less developed regions of which 6% for energy efficiency and renewables. Sustainable urban development : the proposed Regulation provides for an increased focus on sustainable urban development. The increased focus is to be achieved through the earmarking of a minimum of 5% of ERDF resources for sustainable urban development, the establishment of an urban development platform to promote capacity building and exchange of experience, and the adoption of a list of cities where integrated actions for sustainable urban development will be implemented. Regions suffering from severe natural or demographic handicaps : the proposal states that particular attention shall be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions. Outermost regions : lastly, the proposed Regulation includes specific measures shall be adopted to take account of the structural social and economic situation of the outermost regions, which is compounded by certain specific features which severely restrain their development. The specific measures shall include conditions of access to the Structural Funds. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund). The present proposal establishes minimum shares for the ESF for each category of regions defined in the proposal for a General Regulation. This results in a minimum overall share for the ESF of 25 % of the budget allocated to cohesion policy (excluding the allocation to the Connecting Europe Facility), i.e. EUR 84 billion. This implies that a maximum of EUR 183,3 billion remains available for the ERDF for the period 2014-2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission decided that cohesion policy should remain an essential element of the next financial package and underlined its pivotal role in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy.

European Territorial Cooperation is one of the goals of cohesion policy and provides a framework for the implementation of joint actions and policy exchanges between national, regional and local actors from different Member States. This is all the more important given that the challenges faced by Member States and regions increasingly cut across national /regional boundaries and require joint, co-operative action at the appropriate territorial level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t he options assessed in the impact assessment relate to the improvement of the strategic focus and of the coordination between cooperation and regional programmes. The options considered included: the continuation of the status quo (broad priorities, no formal link between cooperation and regional programmes), a scenario focused on thematic concentration and integration of cooperation in overall strategic framework (limited number of thematic objectives that cross-border and transnational programmes can choose, integration of cooperation aspects in Common Strategic Framework and Partnership Contract); a scenario that would fully integrate cooperation aspects in the regional programmes without the need for separate cooperation programmes. The second option was chosen as the preferred one since it will ensure a better focus on European priorities, strengthen the programme intervention logic and ensure a better link and coherence with regional programmes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 178 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: a separate regulation is proposed for European Territorial Cooperation to take better account of multi-country context of the programmes and make more specific provisions for cooperation programmes and operations, as has been requested by a large number of stakeholders. The proposal also: establishes the scope of the European Regional Development Fund with regard to the European Territorial Cooperation goal; defines the priority objectives and organisation of the ERDF, eligibility criteria, financial resources available and criteria for their allocation sets the implementation arrangements, including provisions for financial management and control. The Common Provisions Regulation and the ERDF regulation both apply subject to the specific provisions contained in this regulation. The proposal also includes the continuation of the mechanism for the transfer of resources for cooperation activities at the external borders of the Union, to be supported under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. Synergies and complementarity between programmes under the European Territorial Cooperation goal and programmes financed under external instruments shall be promoted. New element : a new element in the proposal is the provisions on thematic concentration and investment priorities. This is to be seen in the overall context of improving the strategic focus of programmes and their results orientation. Programmes will also contain a performance framework defining programme-specific milestones against which progress in implementation can be assessed. The 2007-2013 programming period has seen the emergence of new forms of territorial cooperation, tailor-made responses to address macro-regional challenges. At the request of the European Council, two macro-regional strategies have been prepared by the Commission for the Baltic Sea and the Danube Regions respectively. The proposed regulation explicitly foresees that transnational cooperation can also support the development and implementation of macro-regional strategies and sea-basin programmes (including the ones established on the external borders of the EU). The implementation modalities have been streamlined for cooperation programmes. The number of authorities involved in programme implementation has been reduced and roles and responsibilities further clarified. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund). In the proposed Regulation, the resources provides for European territorial cooperation are broken down as follows: 73.24% (i.e., a total of EUR 8 569 000 003) for cross-border cooperation; 20.78% (i.e., a total of EUR 2 431 000 001) for transnational cooperation; 5.98% (i.e., a total of EUR 700 000 000) for interregional cooperation.

Concentrating funding on a smaller number of priorities better linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, focusing on results, monitoring progress towards agreed objectives, increasing the use of conditionalities and simplifying the delivery are among the major hallmarks of the proposal This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The Cohesion Fund helps Member States whose GNI per inhabitant is less than 90% of the EU27 average in making investments in TEN-T transport networks and the environment. Part of the Cohesion Fund allocation (EUR 10 billion) will be ring-fenced to finance core transport networks under the ""Connecting Europe"" Facility. The Cohesion Fund can also support projects related to energy, as long as they clearly present a benefit to the environment, for example by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: options were assessed in particular in relation to the Cohesion Fund contribution to investing in basic infrastructure in transport and environment. Various ways of making funding conditional on a sound macro-fiscal framework were assessed, including: (i) the status quo, with a weak ex-post conditionality which has never been applied; (ii) a strengthened ex post conditionality; (iii) ex ante conditionality, which would require the fulfilment of preconditions before the adoption of the programmes. An evolution of the current system best fulfils the criteria of ownership, transparency and predictability, while at the same time ensuring that the effectiveness of growth-enhancing investments is not undermined by the pursuit of unsound fiscal policies. Such a procedure implies suspension of part or all of commitments in the case of repeated breaches. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation determines the scope of intervention of the Cohesion Fund. It includes an article on scope defining the general areas for intervention within the area of transport and environment. The scope of intervention is also defined by a negative list of activities which will not be eligible for support, and a list of investment priorities. Environment : the Cohesion Fund will support investment in climate change adaptation and risk prevention, investment in the water and waste sectors and the urban environment. Energy : investment in energy is also eligible for support, provided it has positive environmental benefits. Therefore investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy are also supported. Transport : the Cohesion Fund will contribute to investments in the Trans-European Transport Network, as well as low-carbon transport systems and urban transport. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 on a European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC), the Commission adopted on 29 July 2011 a Report on the application of the aforementioned Regulation . In that Report, the Commission announced its intention to propose a limited number of modifications to the EGTC Regulation to facilitate the establishment and operation of EGTCs, as well as clarification of certain existing provisions. Obstacles to establishing new EGTCs should be removed while maintaining continuity in and facilitating the operation of existing ones, thus allowing more extensive use of EGTCs to contribute to better cooperation and policy coherence among public bodies without additional burden on national or European administrations. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. The Regulation draws on extensive consultation with stakeholders, including Member States, regions and members of existing and planned EGTCs. The message from all groups, and most especially the active EGTCs and those under preparation, was clear: the instrument is useful and has potential going beyond its anticipated functions, but the procedures for operating and especially setting up EGTCs are more complex and uncertain than they should be. LEGAL BASIS: the third subparagraph of Article 175 in conjunction with Articles 209(1) and 212(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this amending Regulation makes changes, on the one hand, to respect the terminology introduced by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and on the other hand in response to the weaknesses and areas of potential improvement identified in the Report referred to above.  The philosophy behind the changes can be expressed in three keywords: Continuity; Clarity; Flexibility. These changes concern: membership : the proposal employs new legal bases to permit regions and bodies in non-Member States to be members of an EGTC, whether the other members are from one or many Member States. The eligibility of membership of bodies under private law is also clarified; the content of the Convention and Statutes of an EGTC, its purpose : under the proposal, the convention and statutes of an EGTC are re-defined and the distinction in approval procedure underlined; the process of approval by national authorities : the proposal stipulates that th e criteria for approval or rejection by national authorities are specified, and a limited time for examination proposed (this is the single most frequently heard complaint from existing and planned EGTCs); applicable law for employment and for procurement : s olutions, in line with the acquis of the Union, are proposed for tax and social security regimes for employees of an EGTC, who may be employed in any of the Member States whose territories comprise the EGTC. A similar approach is proposed for procurement rules; liability : where some local or regional bodies are required by their national laws to have limited liability and others, in different Member States, are required to have unlimited liability, an insurance-based solution modelled on that used for European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERIC) is proposed; more transparent procedures for communication : Member States will be required to inform the Commission of any provisions adopted to implement the EGTC Regulation, as amended, and each newly established EGTC should inform the Commission of its purpose and membership, for publication in the Official Journal (C Series). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EGTC Regulation is not a financial regulation and carries no budgetary implications for the Union or for Member States. EGTCs may be funded by local, regional or national funds and may carry out actions that are co-funded by European funds. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: company boards in the EU are characterised by persistent gender imbalances, as evidenced by the fact that only 13.7% of corporate seats in the largest listed companies are currently held by women (15% among non-executive directors). Progress in increasing the presence of women on company boards has been very slow, with an average annual increase in the past years of just 0.6 percentage points. The divergence or the absence of regulation at national level does not only lead to the discrepancies in the number of women among executive and non-executive directors and different rates of improvement across Member States, but also poses barriers to the internal market by imposing divergent corporate governance requirements on European listed companies. The European Commission reaffirmed its support for an increased participation of women in positions of responsibility, both in its Women's Charter and its Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-2015. In the European Pact for Gender Equality 2011-2020, adopted on 7 March 2011, the Council acknowledged that gender equality policies are vital to economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness and urged action to promote the equal participation of women and men in decision-making at all levels and in all fields. The European Parliament, in its resolutions of 6 July 2011 and 13 March 2012, called upon companies and Member States to increase female representation of women in decision-making bodies and invited the Commission to propose legislative quotas to attain the critical threshold of 30 per cent female membership of management bodies by 2015 and 40 per cent by 2020. The European social partners have reaffirmed their commitment to further action in this area in their work programme for 2012-2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed five policy options: Option 1 : the baseline scenario (i.e. no further action at EU level); Option 2: a Commission Recommendation encouraging Member States to achieve the objective of at least 40% of board members of each gender by 2020; Option 3: a Directive introducing a binding objective of at least 40% of each gender by 2020 for non-executive directors; Option 4: a Directive introducing a binding objective of at least 40% of board members of each gender by 2020 for non-executive directors and a flexible objective for executive directors, which would be set by the companies themselves; Option 5: a Directive introducing a binding objective of at least 40% of board members of each gender by 2020 for both executive and non-executive directors. The outcome of the comparison of the consequences of the different policy options was that (i) binding measures are more effective in meeting the policy objectives than non-binding measures, (ii) measures that target both executive and non-executive board members are more effective than measures only targeting one group and (iii) binding measures will generate more societal and economic benefits than non-binding measures. The proposal is therefore based on Option 4. LEGAL BASIS: Article 157(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to substantially increase the number of women on corporate boards throughout the EU by setting a minimum objective of a 40% presence of the under-represented sex among the non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges and by requiring companies with a lower share of the under-represented sex among the non-executive directors to introduce pre-established, clear, neutrally formulated and unambiguous criteria in selection procedures for those positions in order to attain that objective by 1 January 2020. A shorter deadline for achieving the objective (1 January 2018) is set for listed companies which are public undertakings. The proposal: specifies the method of calculation of the exact number of non-executive director positions necessary to meet the 40% objective; imposes a preference rule with the aim of meeting the objective: in the presence of equally qualified candidates of both sexes, priority shall be given to the candidate of the under-represented sex unless an objective assessment taking account of all criteria specific to the individual candidates tilts the balance in favour of the candidate of the other sex. This procedural requirement is necessary to ensure that the objectives comply with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning positive action; imposes a disclosure obligation and a burden of proof rule applicable in cases of challenges to the selection procedure by an unsuccessful candidate; provides for a possibility of justifying non-compliance with the objective where the members of the under-represented sex represent less than 10 per cent of the workforce; provides that the 40% objective can also be met where the members of the under-represented sex hold at least one third of all director positions, irrespective of whether they are executive or non-executive; imposes an obligation for listed companies to undertake individual commitments regarding the representation of both sexes among executive directors; imposes an obligation for listed companies to provide and publish information on the gender composition of their boards; imposes on listed companies which fail to meet the objectives concerning the non-executive directors or commitments concerning executive directors an additional obligation to explain the reasons and to include the description of measures taken and planned in order to meet the objectives or commitments in the future; obliges Member States to lay down rules on sanctions applicable in case of breach of this Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation') ; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 42 and Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed rural development Regulation builds on the strategic approach introduced in the current period, which has had a positive impact with Member States developing strategies and programmes on the basis of a SWOT (s ) analysis to best tailor intervention to national and regional specificities. The new delivery mechanism aims at reinforcing the strategic approach – among other things by setting clearly defined common priorities for rural development at EU level (with associated common target indicators) as well as by making the necessary adjustments in light of experience gained to date. The proposed Regulation also includes the European Innovation Partnership on Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability which is aimed at promoting resource efficiency, building bridges between research and practice and generally encouraging innovation. The partnership acts through operational groups responsible for innovative projects and is supported by a network. In this context, rural development policy retains the long-term strategic objectives of contributing to the competitiveness of agriculture, the sustainable management of natural resources and climate action and the balanced territorial development of rural areas. In line with the Europe 2020 strategy, these broad objectives of rural development support for 2014-2020 are given more detailed expression through the following six EU-wide priorities: fostering knowledge transfer and innovation in agriculture, forestry and rural areas; enhancing competitiveness of all types of agriculture and enhancing farm viability; promoting food chain organization and risk management in agriculture; restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems dependent on agriculture and forestry; promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors; promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas. Within the overall framework of the CAP, support for rural development shall contribute to achieving the following objectives: the competitiveness of agriculture; the sustainable management of natural resources, and climate action; a balanced territorial development of rural areas. One should also note that the current cooperation measure is significantly reinforced and extended to support a wide range of types of cooperation (economic, environmental and social) between a wide range of potential beneficiaries. It now explicitly covers pilot projects as well as cooperation crossing regional and national borders. Leader and networking approaches will continue to play a key role, in particular for the development of rural areas and the spreading of innovation. Support through Leader will be consistent and coordinated with the support for local development from other EU shared management funds. A prize for local innovative co-operation projects will support transnational initiatives in favour of innovation. Lastly, a risk management toolkit including support to mutual funds and a new income stabilization tool offers new possibilities to deal with the strong volatility in agricultural markets that is expected to continue in the medium term. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: the first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Single CMO regulation lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, with the aid scheme for the most deprived to be placed under a separate instrument. Dairy sector :the 2008-2009 dairy crisis showed the need to maintain an effective safety net mechanism as well as to streamline available tools. The discussions in the High Level Expert Group on Milk that followed also pointed to the need to improve the functioning of the food chain. The regulation thus aims to streamline, expand and simplify provisions on the basis of experience to date with public intervention, private storage, exceptional/emergency measures and aid to specific sectors as well as to facilitate cooperation through producer and interbranch organisations. Sectoral aids : certain sectoral aids are removed (e.g. skimmed milk, hops and silkworms). The milk quota system and the wine planting ban are set to expire under existing legislation which is thus left unchanged in this respect. Sugar quotas are set to expire by 30 September 2015. A single animal disease / loss of consumer confidence provision and a general market disturbance clause are provided with the latter expanded to cover all sectors in the current Single CMO. Producer organisations and their associations : the product coverage for recognition of producer organisations and their associations as well as interbranch organisations by Member States is expanded to all sectors in the current Single CMO. Support for the setting up of producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector is moved to rural development. Compulsory written contracts : the Regulation reflects the proposal already made for the milk sector that set out basic conditions if Member States make written contracts compulsory with a view to strengthening the bargaining power of milk producers in the food chain. It also reflects the proposal already made on marketing standards in the context of the quality package. From a simplification perspective, doing away with certain sectoral aids, the decoupling of the aid scheme in the silk worm sector, ending the sugar quota system and removing the requirements for registration of supply contracts and for attestation of equivalence in the hops sector will positively impact the burden on Member States and red tape for operators. It will no longer be necessary to maintain a capacity to implement the sectoral aid schemes and to allocate resources to control them. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down common rules for the basic payment scheme and related payments. It seeks to better target support to certain actions, areas or beneficiaries as well as to pave the way for convergence of the level of support within and across Member States. The regulation also includes a section on coupled support. (1) A single scheme across the EU, the basic payment scheme, replaces the Single Payment Scheme and the Single Area Payment Scheme as from 2014. The scheme will operate on the basis of payment entitlements allocated at national or regional level to all farmers according to their eligible hectares in the first year of application. (2) The definition of active farmer further enhances targeting on farmers genuinely engaged in agricultural activities, and thus legitimizes support. In addition, the progressive reduction and capping of support for large beneficiaries is foreseen while taking due account of employment. (3) The following payments are also provided: · a payment (30% of annual national ceiling) for farmers following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment: crop diversification, maintenance of permanent pastures and ecological focus areas. Organic farming automatically benefits from this payment, while farmers in Natura 2000 areas will have to comply with the relevant requirements to the extent that they are consistent with the Natura 2000 legislation; · a voluntary payment (up to 5% of annual national ceiling) for farmers in areas facing specific natural constraints (areas delimited in the same manner as for rural development purposes); this payment recognizes the need for income support to maintain presence in areas facing specific natural constraints and complements existing support under rural development; · a payment (up to 2% of annual national ceiling) for young farmers in their installation, which may be complemented by setting up aid under rural development. At the same time, the Regulation: lays down a simplified scheme for small farmers (up to 10% of annual national ceiling), who may thus receive a lump sum payment replacing all direct payments and producing administrative simplification with an easing of such farmers' obligations related to greening, cross compliance and controls; provides a voluntary coupled support scheme for specific types of farming or specific agricultural systems which are experiencing certain difficulties and which are particularly important for economic and/or social reasons; support is provided to the extent necessary to maintain current levels of production (up to 5% of annual national ceiling with the possibility to go beyond this in particular cases); maintain the possibility for Complementary National Direct Payments for Bulgaria and Romania and includes a specific payment for cotton. In terms of simplification, the new direct payments system will be based on a single type of payment entitlements and streamline transfer rules, thereby simplifying its management. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period.

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the European Commission is working intensively to reach an agreement between EU institutions on the reform of the CAP which will permit the reformed CAP to enter into force on 1 January 2014. The objective is to reach agreement between the Institutions on the MFF and a political agreement on the CAP reform before summer 2013. It is proposed that the new regulation on the However, transitional rules are needed to define technical arrangements which will permit a smooth adaptation to the new conditions, while at the same time ensuring continuity of the different forms of support under the CAP. · As regards direct payments, sufficient time must be allowed to Member States, and especially their paying agencies, to be well prepared and to inform farmers on new rules well in advance. Therefore, the claims for 2014 will be treated under transitional rules. · As for the second pillar (rural development), the definition of transitional rules between two programming periods represents standard practice. However, in this instance, there is also a need for certain specific transitional arrangements, notably regarding the implications the delay in the new direct payment regime has for certain rural development measures especially as regards the baseline for agri-environment and climate measures and the application of the cross compliance rules. · Transitional arrangements are also needed to ensure that Member States continue to take on new commitments for area and animal-related measures in 2014 even if resources for the current period have been exhausted. In light of the above, specific transitional rules need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament before the end of the year, amending the current CAP basic acts where necessary. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : there was no need for consultation of interested parties or an impact assessment since these adjustments follow from the state of play of the discussions between the Institutions regarding the MFF and the CAP reform. LEGAL BASIS : Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the proposed regulation aims to establish transitional provisions concerning the application of direct payments for the year 2014 and support for rural development. Direct payments : transitional measures: · provide for the prolongation of the main elements of the existing schemes – SPS, SAPS, coupled regimes, and also those granted as specific support under Article 68 – for claim year 2014 ; · incorporate, subject to the agreement of the European Parliament, the financial impacts of the European Council conclusions of 8 February, including the start of the external convergence process. The introduction of transitional measures implies that certain dates included in the Commission proposal for direct support after 2013 will have to be adapted accordingly in order to ensure consistency with this draft Regulation. Rural development : the proposal establishes transitional provisions to define how the current measures would be carried over to the next programming period, including their financing from the new financial envelope. In addition, these rules define which baseline and cross-compliance rules should apply in 2014. Lastly, the rules establish transitional provisions for Croatia. Transferring funds between pillars : the transitional measures also include provisions regarding the possibility of Member States transferring funds between pillars. Both the European Parliament on 13 March 2013 and the Agriculture Council on 19 March 2013 took positions on this issue. Whilst the Council took over the European Council conclusions on the MFF, Parliament increased the percentages proposed by the Commission to 15% for transfer to the second pillar and 10% for transfers to the first pillar, the latter being allowed only to those Member States with an average payment below 90% of the EU average. This proposal is without prejudice to the final decision that will be taken by the legislator on this specific issue. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the draft Regulation only implements the Commission proposals on the MFF and the CAP reform for financial year 2015 taking into account the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013. It incorporates the external convergence of the direct payments, the flexibility between the CAP pillars and the co-financing rate for rural development. · For direct payments, the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013 correspond to a reduction of EUR 830 million to the Commission proposal in the financial year 2015 (corresponding to claim year 2014 for direct payments). · Compared to the Commission proposal, the flexibility between pillars is increased according to the European Council conclusions. It will be budgetary neutral as exactly the same amounts reduced from one Fund (EAGF or EAFRD) will be made available to the other Fund (EAGF or EAFRD). · As regards rural development, the draft Regulation has no financial impact as the rural development allocation remains unchanged. However, the distribution over time of the payments might be slightly different than otherwise but it cannot be quantified at this stage. DELEGATED ACTS : the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the European Council of 27 and 28 June 2013, it was considered that a budgetary solution should be found to address certain issues stemming from the final outcome of the negotiations of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 for those Member States most affected, namely France, Italy and Spain. In view of the current economic crisis, as a contribution to the special effort needed to address the specific situations of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and of poverty and social exclusion in these Member States, the European Social Fund allocations to those three Member States for the year 2013 should be increased.

Nonetheless, since the amounts in the regulation are expressed in 2004 prices, the corresponding amounts quoted in the regulation total EUR 126 million broken down as follows: EUR 84 million for France, EUR 17 million for Spain, and EUR 25 million for Italy. The compensation will be provided from the 2007-2013 period with the amounts been made available through the flexibility instrument. From a legal perspective, it is proposed to: modify the Regulation’s articles dealing with: (i) global resources; (ii) on the resources available for the Convergence objective; (iii) the resources available for the Regional competitiveness and employment objective and (iv) budget commitments; modify Annex I on the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations and Annex II on the criteria and methodology for the allocation of the resources.

BACKGROUND: designed to support the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative ""Innovation Union"", the basic principle of ""Horizon 2020"" is to adopt a much more strategic approach to research and innovation. All policy instruments and measures are designed to contribute to research and innovation and to develop further the European Research Area whereby knowledge, researchers and technology circulate freely, and to accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation across the Single Market. The set consists of the proposals for: ·  a Framework Programme for Horizon 2020; ·  a single set of Rules for Participation and Dissemination; ·  a single specific programme to implement Horizon 2020; ·  a single proposal for the parts of Horizon 2020 corresponding to the Euratom Treaty. Horizon 2020 contributes directly to tackling the major societal challenges identified in Europe 2020 and its flagship initiatives. It will contribute equally to creating industrial leadership in Europe. It will also increase excellence in the science base, essential for the sustainability and long term prosperity and wellbeing of Europe. To achieve these aims, the proposals include a full range of support that is integrated across the research and innovation cycle. Horizon 2020 therefore brings together and strengthens activities currently funded under the 7th Framework Programme for research, the innovation parts of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. In this way, the proposals are also designed to realise a substantial simplification for participants. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposals rely on two in-depth impact assessments, drawing on stakeholder consultations, internal and external evaluations, and contributions from international experts. The assessments found that the Horizon 2020 option would bring more clarity of focus, best achieve the necessary critical mass of effort at programme and project level, and lead to greatest impact on the policy objectives and downstream economic, competitiveness, and social benefits, while at the same time helping to simplify matters by e.g. easing the administrative burden for participants, streamlining the applicable rules and procedures, ensuring consistency between instruments and pointing to a new risk/trust balance. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 173(3) and 182(1) TFEU. CONTENT: this Regulation establishes Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) and determines the framework governing Union support to research and innovation activities and fostering better exploitation of the industrial potential of policies of innovation, research and technological development. Union added value: Horizon 2020 will play a central role in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth by providing a common strategic framework for the Union's research and innovation funding, thus acting as a vehicle for leveraging private investment, creating new job opportunities and ensuring Europe's long-term sustainable growth and competitiveness. The proposals have been designed to maximise Union added value and impact, focusing on objectives and activities that cannot be efficiently realised by Member States acting alone. Union level intervention: ·  can strengthen the overall research and innovation framework and coordinate Member States' research efforts thereby avoiding duplication, retaining critical mass in key areas and ensuring public financing is used in an optimal way; ·  will enable continent-wide competition to select the best proposals, thereby raising levels of excellence and providing visibility for leading research and innovation; ·  is best placed to support trans-national mobility, thereby improving training and career development for researchers; ·  is more able to take on high risk and long-term R&D, thereby sharing the risk and generating a breadth of scope and economies of scale that could not otherwise be achieved; ·  can leverage additional public and private investments in research and innovation; ·  can contribute to the European Research Area whereby knowledge, researchers and technology circulate freely, and accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovations across the Single Market. General objective, priorities and specific objectives: Horizon 2020 shall contribute to building an economy based on knowledge and innovation across the whole Union by leveraging sufficient additional research, development and innovation funding. Thereby, it shall support the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and other Union policies, as well as the achievement and functioning of the European Research Area (ERA). This general objective shall be pursued through three mutually reinforcing priorities dedicated to: (a) excellent science; (b) industrial leadership; (c) societal challenges. The Joint Research Centre shall contribute to the general objective and priorities by providing scientific and technical support to Union policies. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) set up by Regulation (EU) No 294/2008 shall contribute to the general objective and priorities with the specific objective of integrating the knowledge triangle of research, innovation and education. The relevant performance indicators for the EIT and JRC are set out in the text.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: designed to support the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative ""Innovation Union"", the basic principle of ""Horizon 2020"" is to adopt a much more strategic approach to research and innovation. All policy instruments and measures are designed to contribute to research and innovation and to develop further the European Research Area whereby knowledge, researchers and technology circulate freely, and to accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation across the Single Market. The set consists of the proposals for: · a Framework Programme for Horizon 2020; · a single set of Rules for Participation and Dissemination ; · a single specific programme to implement Horizon 2020; · a single proposal for the parts of Horizon 2020 corresponding to the Euratom Treaty. This proposal makes it clear that the rules for the participation and dissemination should adequately reflect the recommendations of the European Parliament, as summarised in the ""Report on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework Programmes"". Furthermore, following extensive public consultation based on a Green Paper, ""From challenges to opportunities: towards a common strategic framework for Union research and innovation funding"", the following obstacles were identified to participation rules: · the most important one from the participant's perspective is the complexity of administrative procedures along with the administrative burden; · participants also find it very burdensome to apply different sets of rules depending on the Union research and innovation programme and they called for a greater consistency of rules between instruments; · currently too many procedures, in particular regarding financial controls, appear to be designed exclusively to ensure a very low risk of errors, but also result in control mechanisms perceived as rigid and excessive. A risk/ trust balance is required. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the four proposals rely on two in-depth impact assessments, drawing on stakeholder consultations, internal and external evaluations, and contributions from international experts. The assessments found that the Horizon 2020 option would bring more clarity of focus, best achieve the necessary critical mass of effort at programme and project level, and lead to the greatest impact on the policy objectives and downstream economic, competitiveness, and social benefits, while at the same time helping to simplify matters by easing the administrative burden for participants, streamlining the applicable rules and procedures, ensuring consistency between instruments and pointing to a new risk/trust balance. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 173, 183 and the second paragraph of Article 188 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal lays down specific rules for the participation in indirect actions undertaken under Horizon 2020, and also lays down the rules governing the dissemination of results. The Regulation shall not apply to direct actions carried out by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The rules proposed were drawn up with the twofold aim of: · ensuring a single and sufficiently flexible regulatory framework which will render participation easier, create a more coherent set of instruments covering both research and innovation and increase the scientific and economic impact while avoiding duplication and fragmentation. · simplifying the terms and procedures from the perspective of the participants to ensure the most efficient implementation, taking into account the need for easy access for all participants. The following new features have been introduced into the rules for participation and dissemination in order to apply the above principles and to bring the rules into line with the characteristics and objectives of the new framework programme: · the rules will apply to all components of ""Horizon 2020"", including initiatives under Articles 185 and 187 TFEU, actions currently falling within the scope of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme as well as the EIT activities. The necessary flexibility corresponding to the different nature of the research and innovation actions is ensured by appropriate derogations and by allowing to set out specific participation details in the work programmes; · the rules for participation relating to the Union funding are based on the revised Regulation on the financial rules applicable to the annual budget of the Union which has streamlined and rendered more efficient the way in which Union policies can be implemented; · the financial provisions relating to the Union funding in the form of grants have been clarified and simplified. Thus, they are now establishing a single funding rate depending for each type of action funded under ""Horizon 2020"" with no differentiation among participants. Enhanced use of lump sums, flat rates and scale of unit costs is also proposed; · for direct costs, these rules provide for a broad acceptance of the usual accounting practices of grant beneficiaries, subject to a minimum number of boundary conditions. The grant agreement will include further simplification provisions allowing beneficiaries to gain legal certainty on the eligibility of the costs charged to actions under ""Horizon 2020"". Those simplification provisions will include, among others, a clear definition of the time recording requirements and objective references regarding the annual productive hours; · for indirect costs, the calculation is radically simplified. The reimbursement involves a flat rate based on total direct eligible costs of participants with a possibility to declare costs actually incurred which is limited to non-profit legal entities; · rules applying to the new forms of funding allow for more flexibility, such as those related to prizes to be awarded for the achievement of pre-specified targets or those related to public pre-commercial procurement and procurement of innovative solutions as well as those related to the financial instruments; · given its demonstrated efficiency as a safeguard mechanism, the participants' Guarantee Fund set up under the Seventh Framework Programme will be renewed for the entire duration of ""Horizon 2020"" with clearer rules and the possibility to extend it to cover risks undertaken in actions under the EURATOM Framework Programme; · the rules regarding intellectual property, exploitation and dissemination have been modelled on the widely acknowledged Seventh Framework Programme provisions with further improvements and clarifications: (i) specific new emphasis has been put on open access to research publications and an opening was made for experiments with open access to other results; (ii) the enlarged scope and new forms of funding as well as the need for flexibility in this area of the rules has been taken into account by the possibility to lay down additional or specific provisions where appropriate; (iii) access rights for the EU, and in the field of security research also for Member States, have been provided; · the participation of legal entities established in third countries and of international organisations in actions under ""Horizon 2020"" will be streamlined and stimulated, in line with the objectives of international cooperation set out in the Treaty, based on mutual benefits and taking into account the conditions for the participation of EU entities to third countries’ programmes. Within the clear and stable framework, participants will enjoy further flexibility to determine the most appropriate internal arrangements for the implementation of their actions. This should encourage and facilitate the participation of all research stakeholders, including small research units, particularly SMEs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: details on the budget regarding the Horizon 2020 Programme are set out in CNS/2011/0402 and COD/2011/0401."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has been set up by Regulation (EC) 294/2008 with the objective of contributing to sustainable economic growth and competitiveness by reinforcing the innovation capacity of the EU and its Member States through the full integration of the knowledge triangle. According to the provisions of the Regulation, and based on a draft proposal from the EIT, the Commission shall adopt before the end of 2011 a proposal for adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda, which will define long-term priority fields for the EIT, including an overview of the planned higher education, research and innovation activities, for a period of seven years. The EIT submitted its first draft Strategic Innovation Agenda to the Commission before 30 June 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment. However, the preparation of the proposal took account of the responses to the open public consultation on the EIT as well as the results of the open public consultation. Member States and a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and civil society expressed strong support for the mission of the EIT to drive more and better cooperation between the worlds of higher education, entrepreneurship, research and innovation. According to respondents: · the EIT should play a distinctive role in 'Horizon 2020', the future EU Programme for Research and Innovation, and forge closer links with other European and national efforts; · the EIT should continue to ensure the participation of businesses in its work since this is important for the future success of the EIT; · flexibility, clarity on rules and clear returns on investment are fundamental in order to attract private sector participation; · the concept of integrating the knowledge triangle, as well as the themes around which the EIT is structured, is regarded as highly relevant; · there is much support for the model which has been developed by the EIT, based around long-term highly integrated networks of co-location centres; · lastly, the merit of the KICs is to act as a catalyst for creating additional value from the activities which individual members already undertake on a more fragmented basis. LEGAL BASIS: Article 173(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to adopt the Strategic Innovation Agenda of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology as set out in the annex. It builds on the provisions laid down in the EIT Regulation and complements the proposals included under the Horizon 2020 package. 1)Achievements : the Commission notes that the EIT has completed its initial phase, and has been successful in reaching its main objective - the full integration of the entire innovation chain, bringing together higher education institutions, research organisations and businesses via three initial Knowledge and Innovation Communities, established in 2010 in areas identified by Council and Parliament as essential to Europe's future development: (i) sustainable energy ('KIC InnoEnergy'), (ii) climate change adaptation and mitigation ('Climate KIC') and (iii) future information and communication society ('EIT ICT Labs'). The current three KICs have succeeded in achieving critical mass in their respective areas. The combined strength of partners in a KIC – both in number and in the weight they represent in their respective fields – gives them the potential to be world class. 2) Priorities for 2013 onwards : drawing on the lessons of setting up the initial KICs, the Commission considers that the bottom-up approach should be maintained since it offers substantial leeway to each KIC to organise their partnerships, but further guidance should be given to identify suitable legal set-ups. In the future, clearer guidance should be given upstream from the selection process to ensure that essential strategic features are shared by all KICs, while allowing for differentiated approaches in KICs organisation, delivery and funding approaches. It is important also to enhance the role of the EIT as an investor in the knowledge triangle and enhance the growth and influence of existing KICs. Lastly, the current total number of three KICs does not yet provide the critical mass for the EIT to develop its full potential as a leading innovation Institute. Therefore, in the period 2014-2020, new KICs will therefore be set up in two waves, i.e. three new KICs each in 2014 and 2018, leading up to a portfolio of nine KICs in the period 2014-2020. Three themes have been identified for the first wave in 2014: · innovation for healthy living and active ageing · raw materials – sustainable exploration, extraction, processing, recycling and substitution · food4future - sustainable supply chain from resources to consumers. For the second wave in 2018, the remaining themes (urban mobility, added-value manufacturing and smart secure societies) will be considered. 3) Effective decision-making : the governance model of the EIT has proven its overall value. However, experiences from the initial period show that further efforts can be made to enhance the effectiveness of the EIT's decision-making and implementing mechanisms. The relationship between the EIT Governing Board, responsible for strategic decisions, and the EIT headquarters, responsible for implementation, has to be more clearly defined and streamlined. The EIT headquarters will have to define the critical domains where the EIT should provide support to the KICs, striking an appropriate balance between supporting and monitoring functions. Lastly, the Governing Board needs to better ensure that strategic decisions are properly informed by the experiences from the KICs and the wider innovation community. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the legislative financial statement attached to the proposal amending the Regulation establishing the EIT sets out the budgetary, human and administrative resource implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth assigns a prominent role to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (set up by Regulation (EC) 294/2008) which contributes to a number of flagship initiatives. During the period 2014-2020, the EIT will contribute to the general objective of "" Horizon2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, by integrating the knowledge triangle of higher education, research and innovation. This integration takes place primarily via the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together organisations on a long-term basis around societal challenges. However, given its integrated, cross–cutting nature, synergies will also be sought with other pillars, in particular the ""competitiveness"" pillar. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. On the other hand, the preparation of the proposal took account of the responses to the open consultations on the EIT. Views were expressed by the Member States and a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and civil society. It showed a strong support to the mission of the EIT to drive more and better cooperation between the worlds of academia, entrepreneurship, research and innovation. According to respondents: the EIT should play a distinctive role in 'Horizon 2020', the future EU Programme for Research and Innovation, and forge closer links with other European and national efforts; a majority of respondents praised the way in which the EIT ensures the participation of businesses in its work and urged the Institute to step up its outreach activities. Moreover, respondents considered business involvement as highly relevant for the future success of the EIT. Flexibility, clarity on rules and clear returns on investment is therefore fundamental in order to attract private sector participation; the proposal also relies on the external evaluation report in which the concept of integrating the knowledge triangle is regarded as highly relevant and the themes around which the EIT is structured are well-received; there is much support for the model which has been developed by the EIT, based around integrated networks of co-location centres. Respondents were also positive, and consistent, in their perspective that the value of the KICs was in acting as a catalyst to secure additional value from the activities which individual members already undertook. LEGAL BASIS: Article 173 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal will be implemented as centralised indirect management. The proposed amendments are based on several sources: lessons learnt during the initial period, the proposal for the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda, which builds on the proposal of the EIT Governing Board, the recommendations of the external evaluation report and Commission opinion on the evaluation, as well as the results of broad consultations with EIT stakeholders. The main amendments proposed are as follows: the financial contribution from Horizon 2020 to the EIT will be implemented in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in ""Horizon 2020"" . The EIT funding to the KICs will cover ""KIC added value activities"", however the KICs or their partner organisations may apply to other schemes under Horizon 2020 or European Union programmes in accordance with their respective rules and on equal footing with other applications; the EIT should directly engage with national and regional representatives and other stakeholders from across the innovation chain, generating beneficial effects on both sides. In order to render such dialogue and exchange more systematic, an EIT Stakeholder Forum should be organised, bringing together the wider community of stakeholders around crosscutting issues; the scope of the EIT contribution to the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (hereinafter referred to as KICs) should be defined and the origins of KICs' financial resources clarified; the composition of the EIT bodies should be simplified . The functioning of the EIT Governing Board should be streamlined and the respective roles and tasks of the Governing Board and the Director should be further clarified; new KICs , including their priority fields and the organisation and timing of the selection process, should be launched on the basis of modalities defined in the Strategic Innovation Agenda; cooperation on the organisation the monitoring and evaluations of the KICs between the Commission and the EIT is required to ensure coherence with overall EU level monitoring and evaluation system; in order to assure broader participation of organizations from different Members States in the KICs, the partner organizations should be established in at least three different Member States; the criteria and procedures for the financing, monitoring and evaluation of the activities of the KICs should be adopted by the EIT prior to launching the KIC selection process; the EIT Triennial Work Programme should take into account the Commission's opinion concerning the EIT's specific objectives, as defined in Horizon 2020, and its complementarities with European Union policies and instruments; the EIT, being under Horizon 2020, will be part of the mainstreaming of climate change expenditures as defined in Horizon 2020; the evaluation of the EIT should provide timely input to the evaluation of Horizon 2020 in 2017 and 2023; the Commission should strengthen its role in monitoring the implementation of specific aspects of EIT activities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: during the period 2014-2020 a financial contribution of EUR 3.182.230 million (current prices) for the EIT will be provided from Horizon 2020, the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an important contributor to growth and employment in the Union. If the Union is to deliver its Europe 2020 priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, competitiveness needs to be centre stage. While regulatory means are at the Union's disposal, including smart legislation and cutting red tape for Union enterprises, some market failures can be addressed effectively through public funding at EU level. This is already happening. The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) provides funding for relevant action. The need to continue and develop such financial support was recognised in the Commission Communication “A budget for Europe 2020”. Accordingly, the Commission has proposed a ""Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs"" (COSME) as a means of addressing key market failures that limit the growth of enterprises, particularly SMEs, in the Union. The Programme is designed to create the conditions for European enterprises to flourish and to ensure that SMEs are able to take full advantage of the Single Market's enormous potential, as well as encouraging them to look beyond it. There needs to be a special effort to promote the development of SMEs, a major source of economic growth and job creation in the Union, accounting for more than 67 % of private sector jobs and providing more than 58 % of total turnover in the EU. It should also be noted that particular attention will be given to improve the competitiveness of enterprises in the tourism sector to implement the new competencies of the Union provided for in the Lisbon Treaty, the reason being the significant contribution of this sector to the Union’s GDP and the high proportion of SMEs active in this sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment covering the instruments of the Programme was carried out and it accompanies this Commission proposal. The impact assessment considered four options: ·  Option 1 status quo : this would cover the same competitiveness- and SME-related elements as the EIP is expected to cover in 2013; ·  Option 2 : this would discontinue all current financial interventions. ·  Option 3b : this option would maintain the current scope of intervention with a balanced budgetary expansion; ·  Option 3c: this would mean a focused budgetary expansion, with financial support restricted to the financial instruments and the Enterprise Europe Network. The impact assessment has concluded that modest budgetary expansion is the preferred option (3b), as it would provide a balanced approach in terms of supporting efficiency gains, critical mass, coherence and effectiveness, and tackling market and regulatory failures. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 173 and 195 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to establish a programme for Union actions to improve the competitiveness of enterprises, with special emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. General objectives : the Programme aims to: ·  strengthen the competitiveness and sustainability of the Union’s enterprises including in the tourism sector; ·  encourage an entrepreneurial culture and promoting the creation and growth of SMEs. The achievement of these objectives shall be measured by certain indicators which are specified in the proposal. Specific objectives : the specific objectives of the Programme shall be: (1) to improve framework conditions for the competitiveness and sustainability of Union enterprises including in the tourism sector; (2) to promote entrepreneurship, including among specific target groups; (3) to improve access to finance for SMEs in the form of equity and debt; (4) to improve access to markets inside the Union and globally. (1) Improve framework conditions for the competitiveness and sustainability of Union enterprises including in the tourism sector by supporting coherence and consistency in implementation as well as informed policy-making at Union level. Union actions will include: ·  reinforcing the use of the “Think Small First” principle in Union and Member State policy-making; ·  identifying and exchanging best practices to contribute to implementing the Small Business Act; and ·  supporting SMEs in making the most of the Single Market's potential. Business sectors, including manufacturing and services, and selected sectors in which there are a high proportion of SMEs will be strengthened. (2) Promoting entrepreneurship, including among specific target groups: activities will include: ·  simplifying administrative procedures; ·  developing entrepreneurial skills and ·  attitudes, especially among new entrepreneurs, young people and women; ·  promoting second chances for entrepreneurs. (3) Improving access to finance for SMEs in the form of equity and debt: financial instruments for growth, including new equity and debt platforms to provide equity facility and loan guarantees, will enable SMEs to access funding more easily: ·  an equity facility for growth-phase investment will provide SMEs with commercially-oriented reimbursable equity financing primarily in the form of venture capital through financial intermediaries; ·  a loan facility will provide SMEs with direct or other risk-sharing arrangements with financial intermediaries to cover loans. An annex gives details of the actions linked to improving SME financing. (4) Improving access to markets inside the Union and globally: growth-oriented business support services will be provided via the Enterprise Europe Network to facilitate expansion in the Single Market and beyond. This Programme will also provide SME business support in markets outside the Union. There will also be support for international industrial cooperation, particularly to reduce differences in regulatory and business environments between the EU and its main trading partners. The proposal also contains provisions covering expenses pertaining to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities. Management and implementation of the Programme : management will be largely outsourced: ·  the financial instruments will be operated by the European Investment Bank Group on behalf of the Commission; ·  other actions may be managed by an executive agency, building on the positive experience with the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI) in the current multi-annual financial framework. The use of one executive agency will also lead to a streamlined use of IT tools and electronic portals, thus further contributing to easier access for SMEs. In order to implement the Programme, the Commission shall adopt an annual work programme, which will set out the objectives pursued, the expected results, the method of implementation and their total amount. The work programme will also contain a description of the actions to be financed, an indication of the amount allocated to each action and an indicative implementation timetable. It shall include for grants the priorities, the essential evaluation criteria and the maximum rate of co-financing. Simplification: a priority for the Commission in this Programme, as in other programmes within the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate access to funds for EU enterprises, particularly SMEs, as far as possible. This approach is applied in the Competitiveness and SME Programme (COSME) by basing it solely on the rules of the Financial Regulation, without any derogation. This provides for simple, coherent and standardised administrative procedures for enterprises to access funds. The revision of the Financial Regulation will help to make it easier for small enterprises to take part in funding programmes, for example by: ·  simplifying rules; ·  reducing the costs of participation; ·  accelerating award procedures and ·  providing a ""one-stop shop"""" to make access to Union funding easier. A new system of lump sums is proposed. To allow for an improved access to funding for SMEs, the rules for participation and eligibility of all future Union funding programmes will be aligned to the greatest extent possible. Financial instruments : financial instruments as such are simple to use for enterprises as they address their bank or venture capital fund with an ordinary financing request and not with a project proposal as for grant finance. As regards the financial instruments to be implemented by the European Investment Fund (EIF) or other appropriate financial institutions, the Commission proposal for the equity and debt platforms and the revised Financial Regulation will govern the financial instruments’ administrative requirements. The rules will be simplified to the greatest extent possible, to strike a balance between reporting obligations on intermediaries and beneficiaries on the one hand, and sound financial management, including audit requirements, on the other. In addition, the simplified procedures developed by the EACI will be taken over by the Commission for similar types of projects. Best practices will be shared as regards, for example, simplifications the Agency introduced in grant agreements, contracts and procedures. Further simplification might include more flexible implementation modalities for grant agreements to avoid the need for amendments at a later stage. Participation of third countries : the Programme shall be open to the participation of: ·  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA), in accordance with the conditions laid down in the EEA Agreement, and other European countries when agreements and procedures so allow; ·  acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates in accordance with the general principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of those countries in Union's programmes; ·  countries falling under the scope of the European neighbourhood policies, when agreements and procedures so allow. Monitoring and evaluation : the Commission shall monitor the implementation and management of the Programme. It shall draw up an annual monitoring report examining the efficiency and effectiveness of supported actions in terms of financial implementation, results and, where possible, impact. By 2018 at the latest, the Commission shall establish an evaluation report on the achievement of the objectives of all the actions supported under the Programme. Repeal and transitional provisions : Decision 1639/2006/EC is repealed with effect from 1 January 2014. However, actions initiated under Decision 1639/2006/EC and financial obligations related to those actions shall continue to be governed by that Decision until their completion. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial appropriations for implementing the Programme for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 shall amount to EUR 2.522 billion of which approximately EUR 1.4 billion shall be allocated to financial instruments.

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : recent economic developments have once again demonstrated the need to further strengthen the credibility of statistics. Reliability of statistical data in terms of technical quality- assessment criteria is a pre-requisite in order to ensure the trust of users. But equally important is the credibility of the institutions producing statistics. In this context, the professional independence of statistical authorities must receive particular attention and be guaranteed by law. The Commission recognised this in its Communication ‘Towards robust quality management for European Statistics’ it indicated the need to strengthen the governance of the European Statistical System (ESS) by securing unconditional application of the principle of professional independence of National Statistical Institutes (NSIs), by clarifying their coordinating role in the national statistical systems and by enhancing the use of administrative data for statistical purposes. Furthermore, it was proposed that ‘Commitments on Confidence in Statistics’ (CoC) be established in order to make national governments aware of their role in, and co-responsibility for, ensuring the credibility of official statistics by respecting the independence of NSIs. According to the Communication, all these measures should be introduced by an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. Moreover, the European Statistics Code of Practice should be revised accordingly. The key relevance of the principle of professional independence of NSIs was also explicitly recognised by the European Parliament and the Council in the legislative ‘six-pack’ on enhanced economic governance, which entered into force in December 2011. It specified that the professional independence of national statistical authorities requires transparent recruitment and dismissal processes based solely on professional criteria. Moreover, on 13 March 2012 the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to rapidly implement measures to improve quality-management and governance in European statistics. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal largely builds on the final conclusions and recommendations of the ESS ‘Task Force on the revision of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 and on Commitments on Confidence in Statistics’, which met several times in 2011. LEGAL BASIS : Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the proposal calls for a revision of the current basic legal framework for European statistics, adapting it to meet the policy needs and challenges created for European statistics by recent developments in the global economy. The main goal is to further strengthen governance in the European Statistical System in order to safeguard its high credibility and to respond adequately to data needs resulting from the enhanced economic-policy coordination in the European Union. Professional independence of national statistical authorities : the proposal refers explicitly to the Heads of NSIs as persons whose independence in performing their duties is a pre-condition for establishing the independence of the respective institutions. To that end, it is indispensable that Heads of NSIs have the freedom to decide on processes, statistical methods, standards and procedures, and on the content and timing of statistical releases and publications for all European statistics. They must be also forbidden from seeking, and protected from receiving, instructions from national governments and other institutions. Moreover, Heads of NSIs should be granted considerable autonomy in deciding on the internal management of the statistical office and allowed to publicly comment on the budget allocated to the NSI in the context of statistical tasks to be performed. Furthermore, there must exist transparent and legally binding rules for the appointment, transfer and dismissal of Heads of NSI, based solely on professional criteria. However, Heads of NSIs should not only enjoy broad autonomy, they should also be accountable for the results the NSIs provide both in terms of statistical output and budget execution. Accordingly, they should present an annual report on the statistical activities and the financial situation of the respective authority. Commitments on Confidence in Statistics : the proposal also includes the establishment of ‘Commitments on Confidence in Statistics’. These declarations of respect of the European Statistics Code of Practice, and notably of the principle of independence of NSIs, aim at strengthening statistical governance in the EU and safeguarding the credibility of European statistics. According to the proposal, they should be signed by the governments of all Member States and counter-signed by the Commission, both at the highest applicable level. Each CoC is intended to be drafted individually by the Member State concerned and to contain country-specific improvement actions. The actual implementation of these actions would be monitored by Eurostat as part of the already established regular assessment of Member States’ compliance with the European Statistics Code of Practice. The role of the NSIs : the coordinating role of NSIs in the national statistical systems is clarified by the proposal and explicit references to institutions and functions to be coordinated have been added. In addition, the proposal contains further amendments. Administrative data: the proposal aims to establish a legal framework for more extensive use of administrative data sources for the production of European statistics without increasing the burden on respondents, NSIs and other national authorities. According to the proposal, NSIs should be involved, to the extent necessary, in decisions on the design, development and discontinuation of administrative records, which could be used in the production of statistical data. They should also coordinate relevant standardisation activities and receive metadata on administrative data extracted for statistical purposes. Free and timely access to administrative records should be granted to NSIs, other national authorities and Eurostat, but only within their own respective public administrative system and to the extent necessary for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics. Eurostat : the proposal incorporates the need to adequately secure the independent position of Eurostat at Union level in the same way as is proposed for NSIs at national level. It is crucial for the credibility of the entire European Statistical System and was strongly emphasised by a vast majority of the Member States in the preceding stakeholder consultation. Programming period : in order to simplify budget planning for statistical activities and to make it more stable, the programming period of the European statistical programme was brought into line with the Union’s multi-annual financial framework. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : The proposal is expected to have no resource impact within the ESS. On the contrary, it is meant to simplify and improve coordination and collaboration within the system, thus ultimately leading to more efficient production of European statistics and to a reduced burden on respondents. The human resources required within the Commission will be met by staff from the Directorate General who are already assigned to management of the legal act concerned and/or have been redeployed within the Directorate General. DELEGATED POWERS : the Commission will have the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the recent economic and financial crisis, which hit all Member States and regions in the Union, has forced the EU to face complex problems, such as: high unemployment rates, especially among the low-skilled, the young, older workers, migrants and people with disabilities; an increasingly fragmented labour market, in which more flexible work patterns and other challenges are emerging and which have an impact on job security and working conditions; a shrinking workforce and increasing pressure on social protection systems as a result of demographic change; difficulty in combining work and caring responsibilities and achieving a sustainable work-life balance, hampering personal and family development; an unacceptably high number of people living below the poverty line and in social exclusion. The crisis also highlighted the close links and spill-over between EU-27 economies, especially in the euro area. Coordinated action at the Union level is more effective in addressing these challenges than individual actions of single Member States. To be cost-effective, reforms also need to be as far as possible based on evidence. The involvement of policy-makers and other stakeholders in a collective learning process and in developing and testing new approaches is likely to lead to greater acceptance and ownership of, and commitment to the Europe 2020 strategy. In this context, social innovation, and in particular social experimentation, can be a powerful tool for shaping the reforms and policy adjustments needed to implement Europe 2020. While tackling socio-economic problems is primarily the responsibility of the Member States and regions and decisions have to be taken closest to the citizen, the Union has a role to play in putting the need for specific reforms on the agenda, identifying barriers to change and ways of overcoming them, ensuring that existing Union level rules are complied with, stimulating sharing of good practice and mutual learning, and supporting social innovation and Europe-wide approaches. The European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation is based on three existing instruments: (i) the Progress Programme ; (ii) EURES (European employment services; (iii) the European Progress Microfinance Facility for employment and social inclusion . IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considered three options: Option 1: no policy change : under this option, the Progress programme, EURES and the Progress micro-finance facility, would continue to exist as separate instruments running alongside the European Social Fund. Option 2: a new integrated programme for social change and innovation : the new programme is made up of three separate albeit complementary axes: Progress, EURES and microfinance and social entrepreneurship. Option 3: a single instrument for employment and social affairs : such an instrument would have a shared management strand (the European Social Fund) and a direct management strand. The impact assessment has concluded that option 2 is the preferred option that would bring about the most benefits in terms of efficiency gains, critical mass, coherence and effectiveness, while avoiding political and institutional risks. LEGAL BASIS: Article 46(d), Article 149, Article 153(2)(a) and the third paragraph of Article 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a new agenda for social change and social innovation. The proposal contains a set of common provisions applicable to each part of the Programme and the special provisions applicable to each instrument. (1) Common provisions : Subject matter : the proposed Regulation establishes a European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation which aims to contribute to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy, its headline targets and Integrated Guidelines by providing financial support for the European Union’s objectives in terms of promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social protection, combating social exclusion and poverty and improving working conditions. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Structure of the Programme :the Programme shall be made up of the following three complementarity axes: The Progress axis, which shall support the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Union employment and social policy and legislation on working conditions and shall promote evidence-based policy-making and innovation, in partnership with the social partners, civil society organisations and other interested parties; The EURES axis, which shall support activities carried out by the EURES network, i.e. the specialist services designated by the EEA Member States and the Swiss Confederation, together with other interested parties, to develop information exchanges and dissemination and other forms of cooperation to promote workers’ geographical mobility; The Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis, which shall facilitate access to finance for entrepreneurs, especially those furthest from the labour market, and social enterprises. General objectives of the Programme : these include: strengthening ownership of the Union objectives in the employment, social and working conditions fields among key Union and national policy-makers, as well as other interested parties in order to bring about concrete and coordinated actions at both Union and Member State level; supporting the development of adequate, accessible and efficient social protection systems and labour markets and facilitate policy reform, by promoting good governance, mutual learning and social innovation; modernise Union law in line with the Smart Regulation principles and ensure that Union law on matters relating to working conditions is effectively applied; promote workers’ geographical mobility and boost employment opportunities by developing Union labour markets that are open and accessible to all; promote employment and social inclusion by increasing the availability and accessibility of microfinance for vulnerable groups and micro-enterprises, and by increasing access to finance for social enterprises. Types of actions : the following types of actions may be financed under the Programme: Progress : (i) gathering of data and statistics, as well as development of common methodologies, classifications, indicators and benchmarks; (ii) evaluations and impact assessments; (iii) preparation and implementation of social experimentation as a method for testing and evaluating innovative solutions with a view to scaling them up; dissemination of the results of these analytical activities. Mutual learning, awareness and dissemination activities including, inter alia, (i) Council Presidency events, conferences and seminars; (ii) training of legal and policy practitioners, and EURES advisers; (iii) drafting and publication of guides, reports and educational material; etc. Support for main actors in regard to: the operating costs of key Union-level networks whose activities relate and contribute to the objectives of the Progress axis; networking and cooperation among specialist bodies, national, regional and local authorities, and employment services at European level; funding of European-level observatories. EURES : actions to promote mobility of individuals in the Union, in particular the development of a multilingual digital platform for the clearance of job vacancies and applications, and targeted mobility schemes to fill vacancies where labour market shortcomings have been identified and/or to help specific groups of workers such as young people. Microfinance : support to microfinance and social enterprises in particular through the financial instruments (grants). ( Evaluation and follow-up : with a view to regular monitoring of the Programme and making any adjustments needed to its policy and funding priorities, the Commission shall draw up biennial monitoring reports and send them to the European Parliament and the Council. A mid-term evaluation of the Programme shall be carried out by the end of 2017 to measure progress made in meeting its objectives, to determine whether its resources have been used efficiently and to assess its Union added value. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the financial appropriations for implementing the Programme for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 will amount to EUR 958.19 million (in current prices): 60% to the Progress axis, of which at least 17% shall be allocated to promoting social experimentation as a method for testing and evaluating innovative solutions with a view to scaling them up;"

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. . BACKGROUND: in its Communication entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” (the MFF Communication), in which it recognised the climate change challenge, the Commission stated that it intends to increase the climate related proportion of the Union budget to at least 20% with contribution from different policies. The proposed Regulation should contribute to that goal. The Commission has decided to address environment and climate action as an integral part of all the main instruments and interventions. This 'mainstreaming' approach implies that environmental and climate objectives need to be reflected in all main instruments to ensure that they contribute to building a low-carbon, resource efficient and climate resilient economy. However, the main Union funding instruments do not address all environmental and climate specific needs . Furthermore, implementation of environmental and climate legislation remains uneven and inadequate across the Union. This situation requires new and more efficient ways of implementing legislation, as well as development and dissemination of best practices across the Union. For this reason, and in addition to mainstreaming, the Commission proposes to continue the LIFE Programme currently regulated by the LIFE+ Regulation, and define a more strategic approach with a clearer focus on activities and sectors where LIFE could make a difference. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on the recommendations from the evaluations and the Court of Auditors aiming to increase the effectiveness and added value of LIFE, while incorporating stakeholders' main concerns and suggestions. The options to establish priorities analysed in the Impact Assessment try to strike a balance between the need for stability for potential applicants and the need to better focus on Union policy needs. Three scenarios were analysed: (i) status quo, with a pure bottom-up approach partially corrected by the concentration of earmarked resources on climate action; (ii) a flexible top-down approach for all types of projects; (iii) combining the top-down approach for integrated projects and the bottom-up approach for all other types of projects. The preferred option is the flexible top-down approach. The Impact Assessment analysed options for areas on which Integrated Projects should focus, concluding that Natura 2000, water, waste and air were the sectors with the highest potential for success and where more environmental benefits could be obtained. Lastly, a strong emphasis was put on simplification to build on the changes undertaken by LIFE+, such as the use of e-proposals. As part of the simplification measures, options for externalisation of most of the management tasks to an existing Executive Agency were also analysed, including full externalisation and a hybrid option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal for a new regulation aims to establish the LIFE programme with two sub-programmes, one on the environment and the other on climate action. The objective of the LIFE Programme is to be a catalyst for promoting implementation and integration of environmental and climate objectives in other policies and Member State practice. Special emphasis is placed on better governance, as it is inextricably linked to improving implementation. The proposal discusses the main points of the new programme. (1) Shift from a pure bottom-up approach to a flexible top-down approach: work programmes valid for at least two years will be drawn up by the Commission in consultation with the Member States. These will cover, for example, priorities, allocation of resources between types of funding, and targets for the period. The priorities will not be exhaustive in order to allow applicants to submit proposals in other areas as well and to incorporate new ideas and react to new challenges. The Commission will be assisted by the Committee for the LIFE Programme for the Environment and Climate Action, which will have a dual nature with different chairs and different compositions depending on whether the issues dealt with are related to the sub-programme for Environment or the sub-programme for Climate Action. (2) Creation of a new type of projects, “Integrated Projects”: these aim to improve the implementation of environmental and climate policy and their integration into other policies, especially by ensuring a coordinated mobilisation of other Union, national and private funds towards environmental or climate objectives. Integrated Projects will operate on a large territorial scale (in particular regional, multi- regional, or national, and in a cross-sectoral manner). ·  Integrated Projects for the sub-programme for Environment will primarily focus on the implementation of plans and programmes related to the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Water Framework Directive, and waste and air quality legislation. ·  For the sub-programme for Climate Action, Integrated Projects may focus on the implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies and action plans. (3) Clearer definition of the activities funded for each priority area . ·  The sub-programme for Environment consists of three priority areas: (i) the priority area Biodiversity extends its support to developing best practices for wider biodiversity challenges while keeping its focus on Natura2000; (ii) the priority area of Environment and Resource Efficiency shifts its focus towards implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation; (iii) the priority area Governance and Information replaces the former LIFE+ Information and Communication component and will more actively promote the dissemination of knowledge for decision-making and the development of best practices. ·  In accordance with the Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050, the sub-programme for Climate Action should support efforts contributing to three specific priority areas: (i) Climate Change Mitigation, (ii) Climate Change Adaptation and (iii) Climate Governance and Information. The Commission will ensure synergies between the LIFE Programme and other Union instruments, e.g. it may exploit research and innovation results produced by Horizon 2020. (4) Types of funding : the LIFE Programme should cover all types of funding required to address its objectives and priorities: (i) action grants to finance projects; (ii) operating grants for NGOs and other entities of Union interest which are primarily active in the area of environment or climate; (iii) option of using financial instruments; (iv) encouraging the use of green public procurement when implementing action grants. (5) Enlarged territorial scope : the LIFE Programme (i) allows activities outside the Union in exceptional cases and under specific conditions as well as in countries participating in the programme from outside the Union; (ii) provides a legal basis for cooperation with international organisations of interest to environmental and climate policy that do not necessarily fall within the scope of Union external action. (6) Simplification : the LIFE Programme will continue improving IT systems to accelerate and facilitate the electronic submission of applications. In order to further facilitate the participation of small stakeholders, such as SMEs or NGOs, special attention will be paid to clear, easily readable and unified application forms, deadlines to allow enough time for submission of applications, assistance with the preparation of applications, and publicly available deadlines to reject or award the project proposal accompanied with clear reasons for rejection. The proposal also increases the use of flat rates and lump-sums to ease the application and reporting processes, and will lighten reporting requirements for Integrated Projects. Certain costs will no longer be considered eligible (e.g., VAT), and the eligibility of other costs, such as personnel costs related to permanent staff not specifically recruited for the project, might be limited or excluded. In order to maintain similar levels of support for projects financed by way of action grants as in the LIFE+ Regulation, the co-financing rates should be increased from presently 50% to 70% and in specific cases to 80%, while still ensuring the same leverage effect as today. The higher rate of 80% would apply to Integrated Projects. (7) Central management : the LIFE Programme should remain centrally managed to maximise policy links, quality of interventions, sound financial management and stable resources, and to ensure that findings of LIFE projects are taken up in shaping Union policy. This is considered as an essential asset by the European Parliament, Member States and stakeholders. The Commission will explore the possibility of delegating the selection and monitoring tasks to the European Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation, while keeping the governance of the LIFE Programme within the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial envelope for the LIFE Programme for the period 2014-2020 expressed in current prices is EUR 3 618 million. Of this amount: ·  EUR 2 713.5 million is allocated to the sub-programme for Environment (half of the resources dedicated to projects financed by way of action grants shall be allocated to support the conservation of nature and biodiversity); ·  EUR 904.5 million is allocated to the sub-programme for Climate Action. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020, proposing among other things, a new Fiscalis 2020 programme. The smooth functioning of taxation systems in the internal market is dependent on effective and efficient processing of cross-border transactions by national tax administrations, the prevention of and fight against tax fraud and protection of tax revenues. This implies exchange of large quantities of information between tax administrations, but also tax administrations working more efficiently and at the same time reducing the administrative, economic and time burden for tax payers involved in cross-border activities. This can only be achieved on the basis of cooperation between tax administrations of the Member States and third parties. Given the increasing globalisation, an efficient fight against fraud should equally have an international dimension. Therefore, the programme will also support the exchange of information with non-Member States in the realm of the international agreements concluded with the non-Member States concerned. The proposed programme is the successor programme of the Fiscalis 2013 programme, which ends on 31 December 2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : considering the overall policy context and problems ahead for customs in the next decade, a number of policy options has been analysed and compared: Option 1: baseline: continuing the programme with the current objectives and design. Option 2: no continuation of the programme. Option 3: upgrade the baseline: this option would encompass the baseline scenario tailoring the objectives to the future challenges. It puts additional focus on the fight against tax fraud, avoidance and evasion, working towards a more efficient tax administration, addressing the high administrative burden for taxpayers and tax administrations and considering the cooperation with third countries and third parties. Option 4: upgrade and cater for new policies: besides addressing the problems described under the Option 3 "", this policy option would offer the means to extend cooperation to new areas that may follow from policy evolution. The impact assessment identified Option 3 ""Upgrade the baseline"" as the preferred option. It is in line with the proposal for a new budget for Europe 2020 and scores best on acceptability by Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 114, 197 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Regulation proposes to establish a multi-annual action programme ""Fiscalis 2020"" covering the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Scope: the proposed Fiscalis 2020 programme will support tax cooperation in the Union clustered around human networking and competency building, on the one hand, and IT capacity building on the other hand. The first cluster allows for the exchange of good practices and operational knowledge amongst the Member States and other countries participating in the programme. The latter enables the programme to fund appropriate IT infrastructure and systems that allow tax administrations in the Union to evolve to fully-fledged e-administrations. The scope of the programme has been brought in line with recent Union tax legislation meaning that it will not only cover VAT, excise duties and taxes on income and capital but also other taxes which are subject of Union tax legislation. The programme will be open to participation by Member States, candidate countries and potential candidates. Countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy will also have the option of taking part in the programme under certain conditions. External experts may also participate in specific actions (e.g. representatives of other authorities, trade, national and international organisations, and possibly other experts), if required to realise the programme objectives. Objectives: these address the problems identified and challenges expected for tax policy and European authorities in the next decade. The specific objective of the programme shall be to improve the operation of the taxation systems, in particular through cooperation between participating countries, their tax authorities, their officials and external experts. The programme will have the following priorities: to support the preparation, coherent application and effective implementation of Union tax law; to fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, in particular by enhancing effective and efficient administrative cooperation and exchange of information to contribute to the reduction of administrative burden on tax administrations and compliance costs for taxpayers to work towards efficient tax administration, in particular as regards tax compliance, and administrative capacity of tax administrations. to enhance a coherent application and implementation of Union tax policy; to enhance cooperation with international organisations, other governmental authorities, third countries, economic operators and their organisations with a view to fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance. The main added value of the programme is generated by enhancing the capacity of Member States in fighting fraud and possibly raising revenue, while cutting costs in developing the tools for these purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the timing of the review of EU funding programmes is linked to the proposal for a new Multiannual Financial Framework . In accordance with that proposal, this Regulation on the Fiscalis 2020 programme contains a budgetary framework of EUR 234 370 000 (in current prices) for the period of 2014-2020.

LEGISLATIVE ACT: amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020, proposing among other things, a new Customs programme. The customs union implies the management of large trade volumes on a daily basis – handling 7 customs declarations every second - requiring customs to strike a balance between the facilitation of trade for business and the protection of citizens against risks to their safety and security. This can only be achieved through intense operational cooperation between customs administrations of the Member States, between them and other authorities, with trade and other third parties. From an economic point of view, action at EU level is much more efficient. The backbone of the customs cooperation is a highly secured dedicated communication network. It interconnects national customs administrations in approximately 5 000 connection points. If such an infrastructure were not available, Member States would have to link 26 times to the national systems of each of the other Member States. The proposed programme is the successor programme of the Customs 2013 programme which ends on 31 December 2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: considering the overall policy context and problems ahead for customs in the next decade, a number of policy options has been analysed and compared: Option 1: baseline: continuing the programme with the current objectives and design. Option 2: no continuation of the programme. Option 3: increased support to EU legal obligations such as the Modernised Customs Code (MCC): this policy option would extend the baseline scenario tailoring the programme to the new needs deriving from the evolving customs union environment, including the Union Customs Code (UCC) . Option 4: increased support to EU legal obligations and financial support for technical capacity building: besides the components in the previous option, this option would include a financial support scheme allowing Member States to request support to acquire equipment to control borders-for instance scanners or laboratory equipment. Option 5: increased support to EU legal obligations with a maximised shared IT environment. The impact assessment identified Option 3 as the preferred option as it scores best on acceptability by Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Article 33 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Regulation proposes to establish a multi-annual action programme ""Customs 2020"" to support the functioning of the customs union, and covering the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Scope: the programme will support customs cooperation in the Union clustered around human networking and competency building, on the one hand, and IT capacity building on the other hand. The first cluster allows for the exchange of good practices and operational knowledge amongst the Member States and incidentally other countries participating in the programme. The latter enables the programme to fund appropriate IT infrastructure and systems that allow customs administrations in the Union to evolve to fully-fledged e-administrations. The programme will be open to participation by Member States, candidate countries and potential candidates. Countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy will also have the option of taking part in the programme under certain conditions. External experts may also participate in specific actions (e.g. representatives of other authorities, trade, national and international organisations, and possibly other experts), if required to realise the programme objectives. Objectives: these address the problems identified and challenges expected for customs in the next decade. The specific objective of the programme shall be to support the functioning of the customs union, in particular through cooperation between participating countries, their customs authorities, other competent authorities, their officials and external experts. The programme will have the following priorities: to support the preparation, coherent application and effective implementation of Union law; to strengthen the competitiveness of European businesses through the facilitation of legitimate trade, the reduction of compliance costs and administrative burden, and the protection against unfair competition; to support customs in protecting citizens, safety and security and the environment; to ensure the protection of the financial and economic interests of the EU and Member States; to contribute to the efficient functioning of customs authorities by improving their administrative capacity; to fight fraud and to enhance competitiveness, safety and security through cooperation with international organisations, third countries, other governmental authorities, economic operators and their organisations. The main added value of the programme is generated by enhancing the capacity of Member States to raise revenue and managing increasingly complex trade flows, while cutting costs in developing the tools for these purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the timing of the review of EU funding programmes is linked to the proposal for a new Multiannual Financial Framework . In accordance with that proposal, this Regulation on the Customs 2020 programme contains a budgetary framework of EUR 548 080 000 (in current prices) for the period of 2014-2020. The Customs 2020 programme will be implemented by means of a direct central management mode and in a priority-based manner. Work programmes are established –together with the stakeholders- stipulating the priorities for a specific period."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II) provides a modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance undertakings. On 19 January 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal to amend Directive 2009/138/EC (Omnibus II) in order to: take into account the new supervisory architecture for insurance and namely the setting up of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Agency (EIOPA) on 1 January 2011; adapt Directive 2009/138/EC to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty which required the adjustment of empowerments for the Commission to adopt implementing measures to empowerments for the Commission to adopt implementing and delegated acts. The deadline for transposition and application of Directive 2009/138/EC was initially 31 October 2012 and 1 November 2012 respectively, but pending the outcome of the on-going legislative negotiations on Omnibus II, Directive 2012/23/EU (Quick Fix) postponed these dates to 30 June 2013 and 1 January 2014 respectively. In view of the fact that the negotiations on Omnibus II have not yet been finalised, the date of transposition of 30 June 2013, which has already elapsed, should be extended one last time. The aim is to avoid continued legal uncertainty and ensure the legal continuity of the current Solvency provisions (Solvency I) until the complete Solvency II package is in place. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is not accompanied by a separate Impact Assessment as an impact assessment for the Solvency II Directive has already been undertaken. This proposal is necessary to avoid an uncertain legal situation after 1 January 2014. In the absence of this Directive, a gap would exist between the EU legal system (Solvency II) and that of Member States (where Solvency I as transposed would remain in force) leading to legal uncertainty for supervisory authorities, undertakings and Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 53 (1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Directive does not alter the substance of the current EU legislation: it is restricted to postponing the date of transposition of Directive 2009/138/EC until 31 January 2015; in order to avoid continued legal uncertainty now that the current deadline for transposition (30 June 2013) has expired. It also provides for a new, later application date for Solvency II and consequent repeal of Solvency I (1 January 2016). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: i n the post-Lisbon era and after the abolition of the third pillar the area of justice develops dynamically in order to respond to all challenges. Legislative and policy measures as well as their coherent implementation are key tools. Funding can contribute to the development of this area through supporting legislation and policy-making and promoting their implementation. In accordance with the Communication on the EU Budget Review, a fresh look was taken at the existing funding instruments and delivery mechanisms to ensure clear focus on European added value and to cater for rationalisation and simplification of the funding mechanisms. In ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’, the Commission identified the need for a simpler and more transparent budget to overcome the problems that arise from the complexity of programme structures and the existence of multiple programmes. The area of Rights was mentioned as an example of the existing fragmentation, where action should be taken. Within this framework and aiming at simplification and rationalisation, the Rights and Citizenship Programme is the successor of three current programmes: Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Daphne III, The Sections ""Antidiscrimination and Diversity"" and ""Gender Equality"" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS). The merge of these programmes will allow for a comprehensive funding approach in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: one impact assessment was carried out concerning the future funding activities for the whole area of justice, rights and equality, which currently comprises six programmes ( Civil Justice Programme, the Criminal Justice Programme, the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Daphne III Programme, the Drug Prevention and Information Programme and the sections ""Antidiscrimination and Diversity"" and ""Gender Equality"" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity ( PROGRESS )). The impact assessment has considered three options: Option A: to maintain six programmes and to address some of the identified problems through changes in the internal management of the programmes.; Option B: to maintain all measures of option A and additionally to merge the current six programmes into two programmes. This option would allow for flexibility in the use of funds and in addressing annual policy priorities. It would achieve increased simplification (both for the beneficiaries and the administration) and efficiency of the programmes, since significantly fewer procedures would be needed. The effectiveness of the programmes would also be improved as the fragmentation and dilution of funds would be addressed better within two programmes. Human resources could be freed, since fewer procedures would reduce the administrative burden and they would be allocated to activities improving the effectiveness of the programmes (dissemination of results, monitoring, providing information, etc). Option C: to implement only one programme. This option addresses all problems caused by the multiple legal instruments and by the increased administrative burden of managing multiple programmes. However, due to legal constraints the scope of this programme would not be able to cover the funding needs of all policy areas. A choice would have to be made between the area of justice and the area of rights and citizenship. Although this solution can deliver maximum impact in terms of management, however it would not be possible to address sufficiently the policy priorities and needs of the whole policy area. Resulting from the analysis and comparison of the options, the preferred option is the implementation of two programmes which would cover the funding needs of all policy areas (option B). In comparison to the status quo option B presents clear advantages and no disadvantage. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(1) and (2), Article 82(1) and Article 84 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission proposes to establish a new European Union programme on Justice 2014-2020. General objective : the general objective of the Programme shall be to contribute to the creation of a European area of justice by promoting judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. To achieve the general objective, the Programme shall have the following specific objectives: to promote effective, comprehensive and consistent application of Union legislation in the areas of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters; to facilitate access to justice; to prevent and reduce drug demand and supply. The proposal states that the indicator to measure the achievement of this objective shall be, inter alia, the number of cases of trans-border cooperation. The Programme shall aim to promote equality between women and men and combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in all its activities. Actions financed : the Programme shall finance inter alia the following types of actions: analytical activities , such as collection of data and statistics; development of common methodologies and, where appropriate, indicators or benchmarks; studies, researches, analyses and surveys; evaluations and impact assessments; training activities , such as staff exchanges, workshops, seminars, train-the-trainers events; mutual learning, cooperation, awareness raising and dissemination activities , such as identification of, and exchanges on, good practices, innovative approaches and experiences, organisation of peer review and mutual learning; support for main actors , such as support for Member States when implementing Union law and policies; support for key European level networks whose activities are linked to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme; funding of experts' networks; funding of European level observatories. European added value : the Commission shall ensure that the actions selected for funding are intended to produce results with European added value and shall monitor whether European added value was actually achieved through the final results of the actions financed by the Programme. Implementation : in implementing this Regulation the Commission will establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. The Programme can make use of all financial instruments foreseen in the Financial Regulation. The Commission may use, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, an existing executive agency for the implementation of the programme, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes. The programme may share resources with other Union instruments, in particular the Rights and Citizens Programme, in order to implement actions meeting the objectives of both programmes. Participation of the programme : ac cess to the Programme shall be open to all public and/or private bodies and entities legally established in: (a) Member States; (b) EFTA countries which are party to the EEA Agreement; (c) accession countries, candidate countries and potential candidates;(d) Denmark, on the basis of an international agreement. Under the Programme, the Commission may cooperate with international organisations active in the areas covered by the Programme, such as the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Access to the Programme shall be open to those international organisations. Monitoring and evaluation : the Commission shall monitor the Programme regularly. The monitoring will also provide a means of assessing the way in which gender equality and anti-discrimination issues have been addressed across the programme’s activities. Where relevant, indicators should be disaggregated by sex, age and disability. The Commission shall provide the European Parliament and the Council with: (a) an interim evaluation report, by mid-2018 at the latest; (b) an ex-post evaluation report. Complementarity : the Commission shall ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with other Union instruments, inter alia, with the Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Instrument for financial support for police cooperation, crime prevention and the fight against cross-border, serious and organised crime, the Health for Growth Programme, the Erasmus for all Programme, the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme and the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for the implementation of the Justice Programme for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 shall amount to EUR 472 million."

CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, the Commission proposes to establish a new European Union Programme on Rights and Citizenship for 2014-2020. General objective : the general objective of the Programme shall be to contribute to the creation of an area, where the rights of persons, as enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, are promoted and protected. Specific objectives : to achieve the general objective, the Programme shall have the following specific objectives: to contribute to enhancing the exercise of rights deriving from the citizenship of the Union; to promote the effective implementation of the principles of non discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, including equality between women and men and the rights of persons with disabilities and of the elderly; to contribute to ensuring a high level of protection of personal data; to enhance the respect of the rights of the child; to empower consumers and businesses to trade and purchase in trust within the internal market by enforcing the rights deriving from the Union consumer legislation and by supporting the freedom to conduct business in the internal market through cross-border transactions. The indicators to measure the achievement of the objectives shall be, inter alia, the European perception of the respect, exercise and implementation of these rights and the number of complaints. Actions financed : the Programme shall finance inter alia the following types of actions: analytical activities , such as collection of data and statistics; development of common methodologies and, where appropriate, indicators or benchmarks; studies, researches, analyses and surveys; evaluations and impact assessments; training activities , such as staff exchanges, workshops, seminars, train-the-trainers events; mutual learning, cooperation, awareness raising and dissemination activities , such as identification of, and exchanges on, good practices, innovative approaches and experiences, organisation of peer review and mutual learning; support for main actors , such as support for Member States when implementing Union law and policies; support for key European level networks whose activities are linked to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme; funding of experts' networks; funding of European level observatories.

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND : Council Regulation (EC) No 55/20082 established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for Moldova, which gives all products originating in Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products listed in Annex I to that Regulation. For the latter, limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties. In June 2013, the EU finalised negotiations with Moldova on the Association Agreement, including the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA). In the framework of those negotiations, the Parties have proposed to fully liberalise the bilateral trade in wine. Moldova is currently experiencing difficulties with wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which threatens its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the Moldovan government. The agricultural sector represents around 40 % of Moldova's economy and the wine sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 300,000 people (one fourth of the working population), who mainly live in rural areas and cultivate medium to smaller family plots. The import of wine from Moldova into the Union should be liberalised without delay. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken CONTENT : the draft regulation proposes to fully liberalise import of wine from Moldova into the EU by amending Council Regulation (EC) 55/20081 and removing wine from Table 1 of Annex I. Accordingly, in the table in point 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 55/2008, the last row concerning order No 09.0514 ""Wine of fresh grapes other than sparkling wine"" will be deleted. It should be noted that the WTO waiver for the tariff preferences granted to Moldova does not cover the additional preferences for wine envisaged by the proposed regulation. Moreover, the waiver will expire on 31 December 2013. Accordingly, the EU should request pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the WTO Agreement the necessary extension and amendment of the scope of the existing waiver of its obligations under Article I and Article XIII of the GATT 1994 to the extent necessary to permit the EU to afford duty-free preferential treatment to wine originating in Moldova, without being required to extend the same duty-free treatment to like products of any other WTO Member. A Commission proposal to request the extension of the waiver is already pending before the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EU budget. As the general level of wine imports from Moldova is merely 0.6% of all EU wine imports further market opening is not expected to create negative effects for the EU."

The measures taken so far have not effectively solved the main problems of the fishery, these being: Due to deep-sea stocks' high vulnerability to fishing, stock depletion can occur within a short period of time, and recovery might take very long or fail. The stocks' biological state is largely unknown. Some are considered depleted, others have started to stabilise at low levels of exploitation. In general the fisheries are not sustainable. A new regulation is required in order to deal with these problems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of impacts resulting from different policy choices focussed on five options. Three of these were not considered further because they were considered not representing meaningful management approaches, with disadvantages largely outweighing advantages, namely: (i) to continue the current regime amending it only by needed updates; (ii) to ban fishing for deep-sea species altogether, and (iii) to scale the regime down to being a tool for transposing measures adopted in NEAFC and applying those measures also in Union waters. The two options with relative advantage were: (iv) to phase out the most harmful fishing gears targeting deep-sea species, or (v) to introduce in Union waters management standards that were developed for bottom fishing on the High Sea. Option (iv) was retained as being a more effective and simpler instrument. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes a framework Regulation for exercising fishing activity targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantics, comprising Union waters including outermost regions of Spain and Portugal, and international waters. The objectives of this Regulation are the following: ·  to ensure the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea species while minimising the impact of deep-sea fishing activities on the marine environment; ·  to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats for these purposes; ·  to implement technical measures on fisheries management recommended by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Ensure sustainable exploitation : the general objective of the proposal is to ensure as much as possible the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea stocks while reducing the environmental impact of these fisheries, and to improve the information base for scientific assessment. As long as data and method have not achieved the required level allowing MSY-based management, the fisheries have to be managed according to the precautionary approach to fisheries management. Protect marine ecosystems : in order to reduce the destructive impact on the marine ecosystem, the use of bottom trawls should be phased out in this fishery, as they are most harmful to vulnerable marine ecosystems and have shown high levels of undesired catch of deep-sea species. The transitional restrictions on bottom-set gillnets in fisheries below 600m depth and in the depth-range 200-600m should be accompanied by a prohibition to target deep-sea species. Simplifying the management system for these stocks : the proposal also considers the opportunity to simplify the management system for these stocks, currently subject to a double instrument: catch limitations and capacity/effort limitation. Where this duplication is not necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, proposals are made to regulate the concerned fisheries with only one management instrument. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal seeks to replace the Council Decisions on the Civil Protection Mechanism, which facilitates reinforced cooperation between the Member States and the Union in the field of civil protection and the Civil Protection Financial Instrument, which provides funding for the actions under the Mechanism to ensure protection against natural and man-made disasters. After a comprehensive evaluation of the Civil Protection legislation for the period 2007-2009 and taking account of lessons learnt from past emergencies, this proposal merges the two Council Decisions into a single legal act. The proposal builds on the 2010 Commission Communication 'Towards a stronger European disaster response: the role of civil protection and humanitarian assistance' and the 2009 Communication on 'A Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters' which were welcomed by Parliament (see INI/2011/2023 and INI/2009/2151). The proposal contributes to Europe's 2020 objectives and to increasing the security of EU citizens and building resilience to natural and man-made disasters. Furthermore, by supporting and promoting measures to prevent disasters, an EU Civil Protection policy would reduce the costs to the EU economy from disasters and therefore obstacles to growth. The proposal also makes a significant contribution to simplification. The new decision merges into a single text the provisions relating to the functioning of the Mechanism and those relating to the financing of its activities, that in the past were in separate decisions. It also simplifies the existing procedures for the pooling and co-financing of the transport of assistance (e.g. by avoiding a systematic reimbursement of 50%, as is the case under the current rules, and by appointing a lead state in transport operations involving several Member States), thereby significantly reducing the administrative burden on the Commission and Member States. It also establishes simplified rules for the activation of the Mechanism in emergencies in third countries. The strengthened Mechanism will contribute to the implementation of the Solidarity Clause, on which the European Commission and the High Representative will bring forward a proposal in 2012. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main problems identified in the impact assessment are: i) the reactive and ad hoc mechanics of the EU Civil protection cooperation limit the effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of European disaster response, ii) unavailability of critical response capacities (capacity gaps), iii) limited transport solutions and heavy procedures hinder optimal response, iv) limited preparedness in training and exercises, and v) lack of integration of prevention policies. Following the impact assessment, it was proposed to include the following aspects in the legislative proposal: on response : the inclusion of essential elements and principles on the voluntary pool of assets and on EU-funded assets with a reference to the implementation rules; on transport: a revision of some of the current legal provisions to increase the maximum EU financing rate for transport operations, and simplify administrative procedures; on prevention and preparedness : a general EU policy framework and Commission guidelines, with provision for Member States’ risk management plans (RMPs). LEGAL BASIS: Article 196 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal provides for the creation of a new civil protection mechanism for the Union to support, coordinate and supplement the actions of the Member States in the field of civil protection in improving the effectiveness of systems for preventing, preparing for and responding to natural and man-made disasters of all kinds within and outside the Union. The idea is to provide for an integrated approach to disaster management. The proposal provides for a general objective which is subdivided into specific objectives, accompanied by indicators to measure the progress made. Specific objectives : to achieve a high level of protection against disasters by preventing or reducing their effects and by fostering a culture of prevention; to enhance the Union's state of preparedness to respond to disasters; and to facilitate rapid and efficient emergency response interventions in the event of major disasters. Proposed measures : 1) Prevention : the purpose is to enhance the importance of the EU prevention policy framework and effectively linking it to the preparedness and response actions. The proposal sets out the tasks for the Commission in this context which, in particular, include: i) improving the knowledge base on disaster risks and facilitating the sharing of knowledge, best practices and information; ii) supporting and promoting Members States' risk assessment and mapping; iii) an inventory of natural and man-made risks the Union may face taking into account the future impact of climate change; and iv) raising awareness about the importance of risk prevention and supporting Member States in public information, education and awareness-raising, etc. Building on the ongoing work on risk assessments and to ensure effective cooperation within the Mechanism, Member States are required to communicate, with the help and support of the Commission, their risk management plans by end 2016. 2) Preparation : The main focus of the proposal is on preparedness actions to improve the response planning, to enhance EU response capacity and the overall level of preparedness for large-scale disasters. In comparison with the previous mechanism the main changes include: establishing and managing of a Emergency Response Centre ('ERC') on the basis of the existing Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), which should be strengthened to ensure 24/7 operational capacity; developing a coherent planning framework for response operations by preparing reference scenarios, mapping existing capacities and developing contingency plans for their deployment. Synergies between in-kind assistance and humanitarian aid are also sought; establishing a European Emergency Response Capacity in the form of a voluntary pool of pre-identified capacities, which Member States make available for operations under the Mechanism. The need for increased visibility of the capacities is also highlighted; identification and filling gaps in the response capacities by supporting the development of complementary EU-funded capacities, where this has been considered more cost-efficient than Member States' individual investments. A special monitoring procedure is envisaged and the Commission is obliged to report every two years to the Council and the Parliament on the progress; enlarging the scope of the current EU preparedness actions in the field of training, including through the establishment of a training network and diversification of the training programme. The Commission can also provide guidance on EU and international civil protection training; sending expert teams to advise on prevention and preparedness measures at the request of an affected state or the UN and its agencies; providing the possibility to assist Member States in pre-positioning emergency response capacities in logistical hubs inside the EU. 3) Response : the proposed changes seek to ensure more effective and swifter response through: temporary pre-positioning of capacities in situations of increased risk; proposal of an emergency response plan and request for deployment of the capacities; requiring Member States to ensure host nation support for the incoming assistance, as called for in the Council Conclusions on Host Nation support. 4) Other specific measures : to enable the implementation of the mechanism, the Commission shall be authorised to finance preparation, follow-up, monitoring, audit and evaluation actions that are necessary for the management of the programme and the achievement of its objectives. External dimension of civil protection operations : in operations outside the Union, the proposal promotes consistency in the international civil protection work through: providing assistance through the Mechanism at the request of the United Nations or its agencies, or a relevant international organisation; the Commission informing the European External Action Service to allow for consistency between civil protection operation and the overall EU relations with the affected country; clarifying the cases when consular support assistance can be provided, taking into account a forthcoming proposal for a Council Directive on coordination and cooperation measures regarding consular protection for unrepresented EU citizens. The countries concerned would be the following: European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA); acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates; countries coming under the European Neighbourhood Policy as well as potential candidate countries not participating in the Mechanism; and international or regional organisations where relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements between these organisations and the Union so allow. Financial support provisions : eligible actions fall within the following 4 fields: general actions, prevention and preparedness, response, and transport. The provisions relating to the support for transport under the current Instrument are amended and simplified and introduce revised conditions for financing increasing the co-financing rates up to 85% of the total eligible cost and up to 100% in limited cases when certain criteria are met. New provisions allow one Member State to take the lead in requesting EU financial support for operations, which involve several Member States and allowing an affected Member State requesting assistance to request also co-financing of transport costs. Changes are also introduced to the types of financial intervention to allow for the reimbursement of expenses and the establishment of trust funds. In the case of grants and public procurement, it will not be necessary to include emergency response related operations in the annual work programme of the Commission. Lastly, the proposal contains the classic provisions with regard to the protection of the financial interests of the Union against fraud and other irregularities, implementation, evaluation and transitional measures until the entry into force of this decision. Repeal : when the decision enters into force, the existing mechanisms will be repealed. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission's Communication on 'A Budget for Europe 2020' envisages budgetary commitments for the EU civil protection policy of EUR 513 million in current prices, as follows: EUR 276 million inside the Union and EUR 237 million for operations outside the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the size of the EU mortgage market is significant: in 2008, outstanding residential mortgage lending in the EU27 amounted to almost EUR 6 trillion, or about 50% of EU GDP. The EU mortgage market is also of vital importance for the millions of European citizens currently repaying a mortgage and for would-be home owners. Rising household debt levels exist throughout Europe. A range of factors drive the decision to grant a particular mortgage credit, the borrower’s eventual choice of mortgage product and the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. These include the economic climate, information asymmetries and conflicts of interest, regulatory gaps and inconsistencies, as well as other factors such as the borrower’s financial literacy and mortgage financing structures. While these other factors clearly play a role, the fact remains that irresponsible behaviour by certain market actors contributed to a housing bubble and was one of the key features of the financial crisis. The financial crisis has had a substantial impact on EU citizens. Many consumers have lost confidence in the financial sector and certain lending practices that used to prevail are now having a direct impact.  Figures show that citizens are having increasing difficulties in meeting their debts. As borrowers have found their loans increasingly unaffordable, defaults and foreclosures have risen. Addressing irresponsible lending and borrowing is therefore an important element in financial reform efforts. For several years, the Commission has engaged in a comprehensive review of EU residential mortgages markets to ensure the efficient functioning of the single market. In 2007, the Commission adopted a White Paper on the integration of EU mortgage credit markets. In view of the problems brought to light in the financial crisis and in the context of efforts to ensure an efficient and competitive single market, the Commission undertook to come forward with measures on responsible lending and borrowing, including a reliable framework on credit intermediation.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an impact assessment which identified a series of problems in EU mortgage markets associated with irresponsible lending and borrowing at the pre-contractual stage and the potential scope for irresponsible behaviour by credit intermediaries and non-credit institutions. At the pre-contractual stage, the following problems were identified: non-comparable, unbalanced, incomplete and unclear advertising materials; insufficient, untimely, complex, non-comparable and unclear precontractual information; inappropriate advice; and inadequate suitability and creditworthiness assessments. Other problems highlighted include ineffective, inconsistent, or non-existent registration, authorisation and supervision regimes for credit intermediaries and non-credit institutions providing mortgage credit. Different options : the impact assessment considers a range of policy options for each problem area including no intervention, principles-based rules, and more detailed or specific rules at EU level. It also assesses the most appropriate instrument for measures, considering self-regulation, a Directive, a Regulation, a Communication and a Recommendation. The impact assessment concludes that a package of preferred policy options is necessary to ensure responsible lending and borrowing throughout the EU and that the preferred instrument is a Directive. The preferred policy options will also entail costs for creditors and credit intermediaries. However, these costs will be limited by several factors including the fact that a number of the preferred policy options are already implemented in several Member States, that many of the preferred policy options are already common practice amongst large parts of industry and that substantial synergies are expected between the different policy options. The estimated total benefits of the package of measures are in the range of EUR 1 272–1 931 million. The expected total one-off and ongoing costs are in the range of EUR 383-621 million and of EUR 268-330 million respectively. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of the proposed Directive is to create a responsible, efficient, healthy and competitive pan-European market that works to the benefit of consumers. It should also promote customer mobility, cross-border activity of creditors and intermediaries, and create a level playing field for all actors involved. The proposed Directive: requires Member States to designate specific competent authorities to implement the Directive; stipulates important conditions for both creditors and credit intermediaries in order to ensure a high degree of professionalism in the provision of mortgage credit, such as an obligation to act in the best interests of the consumer and requirements with regard to having appropriate knowledge and competence; introduces general principles for marketing and advertising communications and set out the form and content of information to be included in advertising. The standard information concerns key features of the credit and, when the credit is secured by a mortgage, a warning as to the consequences for the consumer in the event of non-observance of his commitments linked to the credit agreement; creates an obligation for creditors and credit intermediaries to make general information available on the range of credit products at all times. It further introduces an obligation for creditors and, where applicable, credit intermediaries to provide personalised information to the consumer on the basis of a European Standardised Information Sheet; requires credit intermediaries to disclose information to consumers concerning their identity, status, and relationship with the creditor, prior to the performance of their services in order to increase transparency of possible conflicts of interest; introduces an obligation for creditors and credit intermediaries to give explanations on the proposed credit agreement(s) to the consumer at the pre-contractual stage, determined by the level of the consumer’s knowledge and experience with credit; requires, for mortgage credit products, the use of the definition of the annual percentage rate of charge (APRC) used in Directive 2008/48/EC. Details of the APRC calculation method are given in Annex I and provisions for amending the methodology are laid down in order to be able to take market developments into account; provides for information to be delivered to the consumer in the event of changes to the borrowing rate; requires the creditor to assess the consumer’s ability to repay the credit, taking into account the consumer’s personal circumstances and based on sufficient information. It also introduces a duty for the creditor to refuse to grant the credit where the results of the creditworthiness assessment are negative; introduces the requirement for 'responsible borrowing', namely that the borrower must provide all necessary and correct information to enable the creditworthiness assessment to be carried out; introduces provisions to ensure that creditors are able to access information from relevant databases on a non-discriminatory basis; establishes standards to ensure that, where advice is given, it is clear to the borrower that advice is being provided, without introducing any obligation to provide advice; requires Member States to ensure that consumers have a right to repay their credit before the expiry of the credit agreement, giving freedom to Member States to set conditions on the exercise of that right, provided that such conditions are not excessively onerous; establish the principles for a regulatory and supervisory framework for credit intermediaries. This framework provides for the authorisation and registration of credit intermediaries, subject to compliance with certain requirements on entry into the business and on an ongoing basis, and for the establishment of a passport regime. The requirements apply to all credit intermediaries, whether they are tied or not in order to ensure a high degree of professionalism in the industry; stipulates that non-credit institutions must be subject to adequate authorisation, registration and supervision; requires Member States to ensure that appropriate administrative measures or sanctions can be taken in the case of non-compliance with the Directive; requires Member States to establish out-of-court redress bodies for the resolution of disputes between creditors and consumers and between credit intermediaries and consumers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: leaving aside the normal administrative costs linked to ensuring compliance with EU legislation, there will be no budgetary impact. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to take account of developments in the markets for credit relating to residential immovable property or in the evolution of credit products as well as economic developments, such as inflation."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC does not specify how volumes of greenhouse gas emission allowances to be auctioned are to be distributed over the trading period. One of the features of the change from the phase 2 (period from 2008 to 2012) into phase 3 (period from 2013 to 2020) and the implementation provisions adopted so far is that the supply of allowances and international credits is expected to temporarily increase significantly in the short term. This exacerbates the already significant, unforeseen impact of the macro-economic developments, due to which emissions have decreased considerably and are not expected to increase significantly in 2012 and 2013. This combination of increased net supply and reduced demand increasingly affects the orderly functioning of the European carbon market in the transition to phase 3. In the light of such exceptional circumstances, the Commission is currently reviewing the need for a further change of the auctioning timetable and will invite experts in the Climate Change Committee to consider a draft for a future amendment to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 and indicate their view on the appropriate action to be taken before the end of this year. The Commission also invites any other interested stakeholders to express their views on this draft and will actively engage with them in this regard. Meanwhile, the legislative process to clarify the scope of the Commission's powers by means of the present proposal should proceed swiftly and independently of the result of consultations with the Climate Change Committee. Finally, the Commission reaffirms its commitment, as stated in the context of the agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive, to urgently examine and present options for action with a view to adopting further appropriate structural measures to strengthen the ETS during phase 3, and make it more effective. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: for the purposes of legal certainty, it should be clarified that, in order to ensure an orderly functioning of the market, the Commission is able to adapt the auction timetable laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. The proposed amendment would expressly provide such clarification in the relevant provision of the EU ETS Directive. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this measure does not have any impact on the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he euro continues to be an attractive target for organised crime groups active in counterfeiting money, not only in Europe but also in other regions of the world. The international dimension of the threat with respect to euro counterfeiting calls for supranational coordination in facing it; through the Pericles programme, the Commission conducts such coordination by way of exchanges, training activities and technical assistance. Activities with the aim of promoting exchanges of information and staff, technical and scientific assistance and specialised training help significantly to protect Europe’s single currency against counterfeiting and related fraud and therefore to attain a high and equivalent level of protection across the Union. Past support for such initiatives, through Council Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ""Pericles"" programme), has made it possible to enhance the activities of the Union and the Member States in the field of the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. The objectives of the Pericles programme for both the period 2002-2006 and the period 2007-2013 were successfully achieved. The Treaty reflects concerns about the protection of the euro by providing for the measures necessary for its use as a single currency. As the legal basis for Pericles will expire at the end of 2013, its replacement should ensure the continuity of Union support for the activities carried out by the Commission and the Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: f our options have been considered: Option 1 : continue the programme with the same level of funding (baseline scenario). Option 2 : renew the Pericles programme with improved objectives and methodology, including in particular an increased maximum rate of co-financing. Option 3 : merge Pericles with other Commission programmes. Option 4 : discontinue the Pericles programme, and leave it for Member States to organise activities at national level for protecting the euro. The option to renew the programme with improved objectives and methodology is preferred (Option 2). This option has a budgetary allocation in real prices that remains similar to the current allocation (approximately one million euro per year). It adds flexibility in determining the amount of the grant by simplifying the determination of costs to be borne by Member States; it broadens the range of eligible activities by making it possible to finance the purchase of equipment to be used by specialised anti-counterfeiting agencies in for protecting the euro against counterfeiting; and it increases the rate of co-financing up to a maximum of 90 % of eligible costs, in duly justified cases. The higher rate of co-financing will particularly facilitate a more balanced geographic distribution of activities by offering wider scope for Member States to apply. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The application of the Pericles programme will be extended to the Member States that have not adopted the euro as their single currency, through a proposal for a parallel Regulation based on Article 352 TFEU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to establish a multiannual action programme ‘Pericles 2020’ to promote activities for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and related fraud. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The Programme shall contribute to increased transnational cooperation for the protection of the euro at Union level and internationally and to the greater effectiveness of these operations on the basis of best practices, common standards and joint specialised training. The general objective of the Programme shall be to prevent and combat counterfeiting and fraud thus enhancing the competitiveness of the European economy and securing the sustainability of public finances. The specific objective of the Programme shall be to protect the euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting and related fraud, by supporting and supplement the measures undertaken by the Member States and assisting the competent national and European authorities in their efforts to develop between themselves and with the European Commission a close and regular cooperation, also including third countries and international organisations. The Pericles programme concerns this specific sphere of activity of the European Commission and its cooperation with Member States’ competent authorities, as well as with the other European institutions and bodies, more particularly through OLAF. Support from programmes designed to have a wider impact would be less effective in addressing such a specific issue and, in political terms, the EU institutions should demonstrate that they share a real determination to deal with this important aspect of EU policy and European identity. Accordingly, the Pericles programme will: target exclusively the protection of the euro, in the context of a long-term vision that is consistent with other EU objectives, on the basis of the priorities set each year for this specific field of expertise; allow the implementation of other EU programmes to focus on priorities other than the protection of the euro; fully take into account the results of the activities already co-financed in the past in this field, including in terms of targeted rules for beneficiaries and geographical balance; aim not only to have a direct impact on the situation of some Member States but to place strong emphasis on the EU dimension of the protection of Europe’s single currency. The Pericles 2020 programme will make a substantial contribution to maintaining and further improving the high level of protection of the euro associated with the intensification of cross-border cooperation, exchanges and assistance. At the same time, overall savings will be achieved from the collectively organised activities and procurement, as compared to potential individual national initiatives. Priorities and implementation strategies are regularly discussed at meetings of the Euro Counterfeiting Experts Group (ECEG). The ECEG coordinates and is associated with the implementation of Pericles activities. In addition, the objectives have been renewed with special attention to setting Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) criteria. This will also help to ensure proper implementation and monitoring. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the overall budget is EUR 7 700 000 in current prices. This amount is in line with the Commission proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020: ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on the European statistical programme 2013-2017 provides the framework and defines the objectives and outputs for the production, development and dissemination of European statistics for the period from 2013 to 2017. In its resolution of 13 June 2012 on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and own resources, the European Parliament stressed that the negotiations on the legislative proposals relating to the multiannual programmes would be finalised once an agreement on their financial envelopes had been reached. This is why Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 only sets the financial envelope for 2013, covered by the programming period 2007-2013, and invites the Commission to make a legislative proposal introducing the financial allocation for the period 2014-2017 to the European Parliament and the Council no later than three months after the adoption of the MFF for the years 2014-2020. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment was conducted for the proposal for a Regulation on the European statistical programme 2013-17, which included the budget for 2014-2017. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 determines the financial allocation for the four years covered by the European statistical programme 2013-2017 that fall under the programming period 2014 to 2020 of the MFF. the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2013 is set at EUR 57.3 million, covered by the programming period 2007 to 2013; the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2014 to 2017 is set at EUR 234.8 million, covered by the programming period 2014 to 2020. The other provisions of the Regulation on the European Statistical programme 2013-2017 remain unchanged, in particular in regard to the objectives pursued and the annex, which defines statistical outputs for the five years covered. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: since the specific objectives and statistical outputs for the five-year period are set in the Regulation, the amount of budget proposed for the period from 2014 to 2017 is EUR 234.8 million, covered by the programming period 2014-2020."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. This is the purpose of the present proposal. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a priority for the Commission within the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate the availability of Union assistance to partner countries and regions, civil society organisations, SMEs, etc. to the extent that they contribute to the objectives of the Regulation. In the implementation of the new Instruments, simplified and flexible decision-making procedures would allow a swifter adoption of implementing measures and thus of delivery of EU assistance, in particular for countries in crisis, post-crisis and fragility. Furthermore, the revision of the Financial Regulation, which is particularly substantial with regard to the special provision on external actions, will facilitate the participation of civil society organisations and small businesses in funding programmes, for example by simplifying rules, reducing the costs of participation and accelerating award procedures. The Commission intends to implement this Regulation using the new flexible procedures provided for in the new Financial Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission performed an internal review of different reports (evaluations, audits, studies, mid-term reviews). The review looked at what worked and what did not work, and drew lessons for the drafting of the financial instruments. The review showed that the current Instruments contributed to progress towards the MDGs in developing countries. The implementation modalities, such as budget support and the ""sectorwide approach"", have allowed deeper cooperation with partner countries and a more efficient division of labour through co-financing between donors. Nevertheless, the review identified a number of shortcomings. The current implementation process was assessed as too complex and does not allow swift adjustments if required. These shortcomings have been directly addressed in the present Regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) and 212 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes set of simplified rules and conditions for providing the Union's financial assistance to actions, including action programmes and other measures, under the following Instruments: the Development Cooperation Instrument (‘DCI’), the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (‘EIDHR’), the European Neighbourhood Instrument (‘ENI’), the Instrument for Stability (‘IfS’), the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (‘INSC’), the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (‘IPA’) and the Partnership Instrument (‘PI’). The proposal sets out the objectives of the Regulation which are to provide a harmonised set of implementing rules for Relex Instruments, to protect the financial interests of the Union, and to promote simplification and flexibility in implementing these Instruments. Adoption of Action Programmes, Individual Measures and Special Measures : the proposal provides that financing decisions taken by the Commission are to be in the form of action programmes, based on the multiannual programming documents. Exceptionally , individual measures can be adopted outside the action-programme framework. In the event of unforeseen and duly justified cases, the Commission may adopt special measures not provided for in the multiannual programming documents. Support measures : the proposal defines the types of expenditure that represent support to the implementation of this Regulation and which may be covered by Union financing (e.g. preparation, follow up, monitoring, audit and evaluation activities, provision of information and communication efforts). These measures can be financed outside the scope of the programming documents. Provisions on the financing methods : The Union's financial assistance may be provided, inter alia, through the following types of financing envisaged by the Financial Regulation: grants; procurement contracts for services, supplies or works; budget support; contributions to trust funds set up by the Commission; financial instruments such as loans, guarantees, equity or quasi-equity, investments or participations, and risk-sharing instruments, possibly combined with grants; shareholdings or equity participations in international financial institutions, including regional development banks. The Union's financial assistance may also be provided, in accordance with the Financial Regulation, through contributions to international, regional or national funds, such as those established or managed by the European Investment Bank, international organisations, Member States or by partner countries and regions, for attracting joint financing from a number of donors, or to funds set up by one or more donors for the purpose of the joint implementation of projects. Implementing tasks : the Union's financial assistance shall be implemented by the Commission as provided for by the Financial Regulation, directly by Commission departments, Union delegations and by executive agencies, or indirectly by entrusting budget implementation tasks to the entities listed in the Financial Regulation, including under shared management with Member states. Technical measures : the proposal also provides for innovative instruments, such as loans, guarantees, equity and risk-sharing instruments, and describes possible arrangements with respect to taxes, duties and charges. It describes that the measures under this Regulations may be implemented directly by the Commission or indirectly by entrusting budget implementation tasks to any entity or person listed in the Financial Regulation. This provision also defines the type of co-financing (parallel or joint). It also lays down measures to protect the Union's financial interests, and in particular to enable it (notably the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF) to carry out all the necessary checks on the measures implemented as well as conditions governing access to public procurement and grant awards for the purposes of implementing the Regulation. The proposed provisions are significantly simplified and indicate the objective to work towards untied aid delivery. Nevertheless, the articles introduce in detail the conditions for eligibility of third countries (reciprocity requirement, participation in the implemented programme, non-eligibility of certain countries, etc.) and exceptions thereto (unavailability of products or services provided, extreme urgency, triangular cooperation, etc.). Evaluation and implementation report : the Commission should regularly evaluate the results of the implemented policies and programmes, sectoral policies and the effectiveness of programming itself. All relevant stakeholders will be associated to the evaluation and the report will be shared with the Council and the European Parliament. No later than 31 December 2017, a report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of each of the Instruments by means of result and impact indicators measuring the efficiency of the use of resources and the European added value of the Instruments, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the types of actions implemented under the Instruments. The Commission shall examine the progress made in implementing the measures of financial assistance taken in external action and shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report every two years starting in 2016 on the implementation and results and, as far as possible, on the main outcomes and impacts of the Union's financial assistance. Specific tracking system based on the OECD methodology (‘Rio markers’) is proposed. By mid 2018, the Commission shall prepare and submit a report evaluating the implementation of this Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council, and, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal introducing the necessary modifications. Likewise, this report will assess the impact of the measures adopted on the basis of this Regulation. Comitology : the proposal describes the involvement of the relevant committees in the implementation of this Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU’s budget."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was developed in 2004 and covers 16 partners to the East and South of the EU’s borders. Under the ENP the EU offers its neighbours a privileged relationship, building upon a mutual commitment to values and principles such as democracy and human rights, the rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and sustainable development, including climate action. The policy also provides for political association and deeper economic integration, increased mobility and enhanced people-to-people contacts. Arab Spring : changes to the EU’s relationship with its neighbours and developments since the ENP was set up have been analysed and assessed as part of the ENP Strategic Review. As a result, a new ENP vision has been developed as outlined in the Joint Communication of the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission ’A new response to a changing Neighbourhood’. The new approach calls notably for greater support to partners committed to building democratic societies and undertaking reforms, in line with the “more for more” and ""mutual accountability"" principles, and provides the strategic policy framework for the EU relations with the neighbours. Reform of the ENPI : although the ENPI has been widely recognized as a successful Instrument to accompany the EU’s policy towards its neighbours, the ENP policy review and other assessments, lessons learned and public consultations have all identified a number of issues to tackle in the future by adapting the Instrument to make the EU’s response even more effective, in particular: application of the “more for more” principle; complexity and length of the programming process; scope of the Instrument; partly outdated implementation provisions and lack of coherence between the external instruments; Cross-Border Cooperation (CBC) provisions; linkages with internal instruments/policies; evolving relationship with Russia. The future European Neighbourhood Instrument should be aligned to the new ENP vision and address the specific challenges and issues as identified above. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment reviewed the following four options: Option 0 : ‘No EU action’. The EU stops providing financial support through a dedicated Instrument for Neighbourhood countries; Option 1 : ‘No change’. Cooperation with the countries concerned remains strictly in the framework of the existing ENPI Regulation; Option 2 : ‘Adapting the current set-up’. The future legislative proposal should be based on the current ENPI Regulation with a number of substantial amendments, responding to the new policy context and specific objectives. Under this Option there are a number of sub-options referring to: the differentiation principle; the programming process; scope of the Instrument and coherence between policy and assistance; Cross-Border Cooperation rules; implementation provision, notably to allow for greater flexibility; linkages with internal policies and instruments and geographic scope of the ENI. Option 3 : ‘Tabling a completely new Instrument’ with a different geographic scope and focussing on objectives broader than or different from those of the ENP. Based on the analysis, Option 2 would have the highest potential to yield a positive impact and to adapt the current cooperation framework to the new policy context, ENP objectives and challenges identified through evaluations and lessons learned. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) and Article 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, the Commission proposes to establish assistance to the partner countries listed below with the aim of establishing an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness at the EU’s borders. Partner countries : as well as Russia in accordance with specific provisions. Specific objectives of Union’s support : support under this Regulation shall promote enhanced political cooperation and progressive economic integration between the Union and the partner countries and, in particular, the implementation of partnership and cooperation agreements, association agreements or other existing and future agreements, and jointly agreed action plans. Union support should target in particular: promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, principles of equality, establishing deep and sustainable democracy, promoting good governance and developing a thriving civil society including social partners; achieving progressive integration into the Union internal market and enhanced sector and cross-sectoral co-operation including through legislative approximation and regulatory convergence towards Union and other relevant international standards, related institution building and investments, notably in interconnections; creating conditions for well managed mobility of people and promotion of people-to-people contacts; sustainable and inclusive development in all aspects, poverty reduction, including through private-sector development; promotion of internal economic, social and territorial cohesion, rural development, climate action and disaster resilience; promoting confidence building and other measures contributing to security and the prevention and settlement of conflicts; enhancing sub-regional, regional and Neighbourhood wide collaboration as well as Cross-Border Cooperation. Union support may also be used in other areas when this is consistent with the overall objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The achievement of these objectives shall be measured using notably the relevant EU periodic reports on the implementation of the policy and the relevant indicators established by international organisations and other relevant bodies. Framework strategy : the key elements of the proposal (as compared to the current set-up) and their rationale are the following: pply the principle of “more for more” and mutual accountability in line with the new vision of the ENP, notably through specific provisions on differentiation for financial allocations and for the programming process, as required; address the complexity and length of the programming process in order to streamline, shorten and better focus the process, especially for ENP partners that have jointly agreed with the EU strategic priorities in Action Plans or equivalent documents; streamline the scope of the Instrument , striking a balance between flexibility of the Instrument and focus on the policy objectives and key areas of cooperation; adapt the implementation provisions and improve coherence between the external instruments; improve the provisions on the Cross-Border Cooperation to facilitate effective and fast implementation of the programmes; promote closer links with EU internal instruments and policies, including by stepping up cooperation with the Commission at the programming stage and, where relevant, promote mechanisms to pool funds from internal and external headings of the EU budget; respond to the evolving relationship with Russia by amending provisions on Russia’s eligibility for ENI funding to reflect the specific status of Russia as an EU neighbour and strategic partner. Strategic framework and indicative programming : the scope of the Instrument has been streamlined by bringing down the 29 thematic areas that feature in the current ENPI Regulation to six specific objectives. A new, simplified programming tool for most of the neighbouring countries (Single Support Framework) has been introduced. This new programming document will be shorter than the Strategy Papers and Multiannual Indicative Programmes, will prevent duplication of information contained in the legal/political documents that underpin EU relations with its neighbours, and should help shorten the programming process, therefore reducing administrative costs. The new article that allows funds from the ENI and the relevant internal Heading of the EU budget to be pooled with a single set of rules for measures addressing notably cross-border challenges will substantially improve efficiency and reduce the administrative costs of implementing such measures. Simplified implementation : t o implement the new ENI Regulation, simplified and flexible procedures should lead to swifter adoption of implementing measures and swifter delivery of EU assistance, in particular in situations of crises or threats to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, or natural or man-made disasters. Revision of the Financial Regulation, which has particularly substantial provisions on external action, will also help facilitate the participation of civil society organisations and small businesses in funding programmes. The Commission intends to implement this Regulation using the new flexible procedures provided for in the new Financial Regulation. Furthermore additional simplification will also be achieved through the development of one horizontal framework regulation comprising all general and recurring provisions, providing for increased coherence between the external actions instruments. Coherence and complementarity : in implementing this Regulation, coherence shall be ensured with other areas of the Union external action as well as other relevant Union policies. Other measures are provided to ensure donor coordination. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Commission in its Communication of 29 June 2011 entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” proposed allocating to the ENI EUR 18 182 300 000 (current prices) for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: delegated powers to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union should be conferred to the Commission for adopting the specific implementing measures required for the Cross-Border Cooperation mechanisms established in Title III of this Regulation. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should further ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Taking into account the nature of those implementing acts, in particular their policy orientation nature or their financial implications, the examination procedure should in principle be used for their adoption, except for measures of a small financial scale."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries This Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: f or the past 50 years the EU has simultaneously pursued integration and enlargement, increasing from 6 to the present 27 Member States and from a population of less than 200 million to more than 500 million people. A review, five years after the fifth enlargement of the EU in 2004, concluded that: the latest enlargements had brought greater prosperity for all EU citizens and made Europe a stronger player in the world economy. Currently, the EU is dealing with 5 candidate countries (Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey) and 4 potential candidates (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia as well as Kosovo). By 2014, only Croatia is foreseen to become a Member State. Socio-economic indicators show that, with the exception of Iceland, enlargement countries are still well below the EU average and even below the level of the weakest Member States. This low level of socio-economic development calls for substantial investments to bring these countries closer to EU standards and allow them to take on board the obligations of membership and to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market. In addition, the countries in the Western Balkans are still relatively young states where political stability and the full establishment of the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and good governance — all fundamental values of the EU — still need to be strengthened. These countries cannot sustain alone all the efforts and cost of meeting the criteria for joining the EU. Technical and financial assistance to the Enlargement countries is currently provided through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) which will expire at the end of 2013. With a view to future accessions, the EU should continue to offer candidate countries and potential candidates technical and financial assistance to overcome their difficult situation and develop sustainably by concentrating on the following elements: promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe; continue to pursue the general policy objective of supporting candidate countries and potential candidates in their preparations for EU membership and the progressive alignment of their institutions and economies with the standards and policies of the European Union; strengthen the coherence between the financial assistance and the overall progress made in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy; operate more flexibly and to leverage more funds from other donors or the private sector by using innovative financing instruments, pursue simplification and reduction of the administrative burden linked to managing the financial assistance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined three options: Sub-option 2.1 : ‘Reduce scope and keep implementation arrangements’, focusing on the necessary legal and institutional changes needed to comply with the accession criteria, without committing any significant funds for co-financing public investment for socio-economic development. Sub-option 2.2 : ‘Keep the component structure and add more focus on investments’ in order to increase the socio-economic impact in the beneficiary countries and to speed up their preparation for managing structural, cohesion and rural development funds. Sub-option 2.3 : ‘Maintain the scope and adjust implementation arrangements’, covering both compliance with the accession criteria and support for socio-economic development. In addition, adjust aspects of the current IPA set-up and implementation modalities. The improved modalities for delivering assistance under option 2.3, by increasing its focus, efficiency, effectiveness, leverage and impact, were assessed as likely to have overall a more positive impact than the increased investments in socio-economic development under option 2.2. Option 2.3 is therefore the preferred option. CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, the Commission proposes to establish an Instrument for Pre–accession Assistance (‘IPA’) aims to support candidate countries and potential candidates listed in the Annex in implementing the political, institutional, legal, administrative, social and economic reforms required to bring the countries closer to Union values and to progressively align to Union rules, standards, policies and practices with a view to Union membership. Specific objectives : assistance under this Regulation shall pursue the following specific objectives according to the needs of each beneficiary country and their individual enlargement agenda: Support for political reforms , inter alia: (i). strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law, including its implementation; (ii). promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, enhanced respect for minority rights, promotion of gender equality, non-discrimination and freedom of the press, and promotion of good neighbourly relations; (iii). the fight against corruption and organised crime; (iv). public administration reform and good governance; (v). the development of civil society and social dialogue; (vi). reconciliation, peace building and confidence building measures; Support for economic, social and territorial development , with a view to a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, inter alia through: (i). the achievement of Union standards in the economy and economic governance; (ii) economic reforms necessary to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union, while pursuing economic, social and environmental goals; (iii). fostering employment and developing human capital; (iv). social and economic inclusion, in particular of minorities and vulnerable groups; (v). development of physical capital, the improvement of connections with Union and regional networks; Strengthening of the ability of beneficiary countries to fulfil the obligations stemming from membership by supporting progressive alignment with and adoption, implementation and enforcement of the acquis communautaire, structural, cohesion, agricultural and rural development funds and policies of the Union. Regional integration and territorial cooperation involving beneficiary countries, Member States and, where appropriate, third countries within the scope of Regulation establishing a European Neighbourhood Instrument. Progress towards achievement of the specific objectives set out above shall be assessed through indicators laid down in the proposal. The indicators shall be used for monitoring, evaluation and review of performance, as appropriate. Countries concerned: Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Iceland Kosovo Montenegro Serbia Turkey The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Strategic planning T he delivery of assistance will be made more coherent, strategic and result-oriented , by: Addressing policy areas through comprehensive multi-annual country (and multi-beneficiary) strategy papers reflecting the political priorities of the Enlargement Strategy and covering, for each policy area, all necessary institution building, acquis compliance and investment actions. The scope will be based on a needs assessment and will be adapted to the country context. Reinforcing (co-)financing of agreed sector strategies contributing to the policy objectives, as opposed to individual projects, thus moving away from purely grantfinanced projects and increasing the share of assistance funded through support at sector level (including sector budget support for selected policy areas based on effectively targeted conditionalities). Nevertheless, support for acquis compliance will remain available through project support or other implementation modalities such as dedicated facilities, when not covered by overarching sector strategies. More systematic multi-annual programming also for policy objectives pursued by transition and institution-building assistance (e.g. public administration reform; reform of justice systems, etc.), supporting effective implementation of the related sector strategies and ultimately attainment of the related objectives. Making financial assistance more directly conditional on improved governance and growing ownership by the beneficiary countries. Elements of flexibility will be introduced to cater for emerging needs and give incentives to improve performance. The delivery of assistance will be made more flexible and tailored to address needs, by : Allowing un-differentiated access to assistance (irrespective of candidate or potential candidate status), albeit with a different scope or intensity, on the basis of needs and technical and administrative capacity. The needs of the beneficiary countries would be the starting point for determining the sectors/policy areas for assistance. Envisaging a more progressive, phased approach to the management of financial assistance, whereby management would be by the Commission or by the beneficiary country, with or without ex-ante controls by the Commission, depending on accession status/perspective, sector/policy area of assistance, and administrative, technical and management capacity. The creation of management structures and procedures mirroring those that need to be in place post-accession would continue to be the aim in relevant sectors in preparation for accession. Linking progress along different management phases to political priorities , as reflected in progress reports, the achievement of negotiation benchmarks or the track record in implementing the Association Agreements. Increasing flexibility between priorities for a more result-oriented delivery of the assistance , allowing allocations to be transferred between policy areas, with the possibility to carry over funds from one year to another, where allowed by the new Financial Regulation. Indicative programming : the proposal also envisages that strategic decisions on the allocation of assistance are made through comprehensive country and multi-country strategy papers covering the full period of the new financial framework (2014-2020) and reviewed once at mid-term, replacing the current system of three-year rolling indicative planning documents revised each year. This will reduce, for all stakeholders involved, the administrative burden related to the yearly review of each document and possible ensuing revisions. Similarly, less administration for all and quicker delivery of assistance will follow from introducing multi-annual programming for transition and capacity-building assistance as well. Simplified implementation : a priority for the Commission in this new Regulation, as in other programmes under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate Union assistance to beneficiary countries and regions, civil society organisations, SMEs, etc. This proposal pursues simplification primarily by streamlining the component structure around principal policy areas. This translates into simplification of the legislative framework for the instrument and the future implementing rules, with streamlined provisions. Simplification and flexible procedures in the implementation of the new Regulation, will allow swifter adoption of implementing measures and delivery of EU assistance. In implementing this Regulation, the Commission will use the simplified procedures provided for in the new Financial Regulation. Different Commission services will remain responsible for managing and implementing the assistance in the different policy areas. However, coordination, communication and implementation on the ground will be further improved through simplification of a number of aspects, including closer joint monitoring of the progress of implementation in the beneficiary countries and fewer processes for accreditation and conferral of management powers. Beneficiary’s change of status : it will no longer be necessary to go through a cumbersome procedure to reflect a beneficiary’s change of status, thus reducing the gap between the political decisions on financial assistance and implementation on the ground. Similarly, should a new country become a potential candidate for EU accession, the procedural requirements for including that country among the beneficiaries of assistance would be considerably simplified. Coherence and complementarity : increasing the coherence of action by the Commission should also substantially reduce the cost and burden of coordination incurred by beneficiary countries, on account of the different communication channels and procedures used by the Commission. Follow-up and evaluation : detailed provisions on joint monitoring and the accreditation processes will be set out in separate implementing rules. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in its Communication on ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’, the European Commission proposed to allocate an amount of EUR 14 110 100 000 (current prices) to the new Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: considering that the discretionary policy decisions on the status of applicant countries should be taken at another level, it is proposed that amendments made to the list of beneficiary countries in Annex to the proposed Regulation to reflect such decisions should be adopted by way of a delegated act in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, since such amendments will not actually affect an essential element of the Regulation. It is also proposed that the Commission should be conferred delegated powers to adopt detailed rules establishing uniform conditions for implementing the proposed Regulation, in particular as regards management structures and procedures. Such rules are needed to complement the common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union's instruments for external action established by the Common Implementing Regulation. They should take into account the lessons learnt from the management and implementation of past pre-accession assistance and be adapted to the evolution of the situation in the beneficiary countries."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments.

The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation This Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal for a Partnership Instrument replaces the financing Instrument for Cooperation with Industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI), which came into force in 2007, and which has been the EU’s main vehicle for collaboration with developed countries. The ICI has proved an effective toolbox for providing a differentiated and appropriate response to widen and deepen the cooperation with 17 countries (industrialised countries and high-income territories in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and the Gulf region). It has been recently extended to developing countries with the adoption of the ICI+ proposal. However, as it is due to expire by the end of 2013; a new financial instrument is needed for the period 2014-2020. Moreover, since the ICI Regulation entered into force, the EU has seen in particular the emergence of economies such as India, China and Brazil which are playing an increasingly prominent role in the international economy and trade, in multilateral fora (UN and G20) and in addressing challenges of global concern. While development and poverty alleviation remain a key concern, these countries are o developed broad based agreements with key partners and emerging economies to address bilateral issues and matters of global concern. Implementation of these instruments (i.e.: as agreements, declarations, action plans etc) requires a dedicated financing instrument so that the EU has the means to promote its interests effectively worldwide and to deal with global issues wherever the need arises. The EU does not currently possess a genuine instrument that would allow it to co-operate with new emerging economies on issues related to advancing core EU interests and on common challenges of global concern (such as climate change for instance or the need to promote sustainable development at all levels). The proposed Partnership Instrument is designed to overcome this limitation of the EU’s ability to engage internationally in the most effective way. It would fill the gap described above and, in particular, allow the EU to pursue agendas beyond development cooperation with global players, but also to defend core EU interests with any other partner country as the need arises. It could also underpin new relationships with countries graduating from bilateral development assistance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission examined 4 policy options: Option 0 : “Zero Option”: this implies that assistance under the current ICI instrument would be phased out as of 31 December 2013. Option 1 : “No change”: maintaining the status quo, the ICI Regulation would cover only traditional industrialised and high- income countries (.i.e. 17 countries) and the DCI Regulation would remain the only financial instrument, focused on development cooperation, to cover cooperation with some countries of great importance in terms of economics, demographics, and politics. Option 2 : “Maintain ICI as such and amend DCI”: this option would maintain the ICI in its current form and insert a window for economic, financial and technical cooperation of a non developmental nature with third countries within the DCI. Option 3 : “Table a new Instrument building on ICI/ICI+”: this option would build on the ICI and ICI+ proposal to provide a new Instrument with a global reach. After careful evaluation, neither discontinuing the ICI nor maintaining the status quo were deemed to be politically viable solutions. Limiting expenditure exclusively to action linked to poverty alleviation or maintaining this sole focus for cooperation with emerging economies would artificially limit the EU’s external action and neglect core EU interests. The option of amending the Development Cooperation Instrument to allow expenditure not related to official development assistance would have the advantage of geographical coherence (one instrument per country), but the difficulties of managing an instrument with two very different objectives were considered a serious handicap. By process of elimination, the preferred option is that of creating a new Instrument with a global reach (option 3) as this would allow for a clear distinction with Development Cooperation money and respect the Commission’s intention to increase coherence and consistency through a major simplification of the Instruments. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 207(2), 209(1) and 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed R egulation aims to establish a Partnership Instrument for cooperation with third countries to advance and promote EU and mutual interests. The Partnership Instrument shall support measures that respond in an effective and flexible manner to objectives arising from the Union's bilateral, regional or multilateral relationships with third countries and address challenges of global concern. Specific objectives : the measures to be financed under this Instrument shall reflect the following specific Union objectives: implementing the international dimension of the “Europe 2020” strategy by supporting Union’s bilateral, regional and inter-regional cooperation partnership strategies, by promoting policy dialogues and by developing collective approaches and responses to challenges of global concern such as energy security, climate change and environment. This objective shall be measured by the uptake of the “Europe 2020” policies and objectives by key partner countries; improving market access and developing trade, investment and business opportunities for European companies by means of economic partnerships and business and regulatory cooperation. This objective shall be measured by the Union’s share in foreign trade with key partner countries and by trade and investments flows to partner countries specifically targeted by actions, programmes and measures under this Regulation; enhancing widespread understanding and visibility of the Union and its role on the world scene by means of public diplomacy, education/academic cooperation and outreach activities to promote Union’s values and interests. General principles : to promote, develop and consolidate the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which it is founded by means of dialogue and cooperation with third countries; to enhance the impact of the Union’s assistance, a differentiated and flexible approach shall be pursued, where appropriate, in designing cooperation with partner countries to take account of their economic, social and political contexts as and also of the Union’s specific interests, policy priorities and strategies; to promote a multilateral approach to global challenges and shall foster cooperation with international or regional organisations and bodies, including international financial institutions, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, OECD, and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G20) and other bilateral donors; to ensure coherence and consistency with other areas of its external action, in particular the Development Cooperation Instrument for developing countries, and with other relevant Union’s policies when formulating policy, strategic planning and programming and implementing measures; to defend the Union’s specific interests, policy priorities and strategies. Third countries concerned : a ll third countries, regions and territories may be eligible for cooperation under this Regulation. However, this Regulation shall primarily support cooperation measures with developed and developing countries which play an increasingly prominent role in the international economy and trade, in multilateral fora, in global governance and in addressing challenges of global concern and where the Union has significant interests. Areas of cooperation : detailed areas of cooperation to be pursued by the Union’s assistance under this Regulation are listed in the Annex. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend or supplement the Annex. Programming and Indicative allocation of funds : the multi-annual indicative programmes shall set out the Union’s strategic and/or mutual interests and priorities, the specific objectives and expected results. For countries or regions for which a Joint Framework Document, laying down a comprehensive Union strategy has been established, the multi-annual indicative programmes shall be based on this document. The multiannual indicative programmes shall also set out the priority areas selected for financing by the Union and shall outline the indicative financial allocation of funds. Coherence and complementarity : coherence and complementarity with other external action geographical instruments, in particular the Development Cooperation Instrument, will be taken into account throughout the programming stage while integrating the principles of differentiation and concentration. Implementation : the implementation has been greatly simplified as an Article stipulates that the decision shall be implemented in accordance with the future Regulation establishing common implementation rules for external relations financing instruments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Commission in its Communication of 29 June 2011 entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” proposed allocating to the Partnership Instrument a total amount of EUR 1 131 million, at current prices, over the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to adapt the scope of this Regulation to the rapidly evolving reality in third countries, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the detailed areas of cooperation defined in the Annex. It is of particular importance that the Commission should carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights (Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union). Furthermore, as also provided in the Treaty, the Union's action on the international scene “shall be guided by the principles which have inspired its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.” (Article 21). Therefore, the promotion of democracy and human rights is an essential aspect of the EU’s external action. In promoting human rights and democracy worldwide, the EU is using a wide range of measures, from political dialogue and diplomatic initiatives to financial and technical cooperation and assistance. The Regulation on establishing a European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)1 constitutes a corner stone of this political strategy and is a unique and visible expression of the EU’s strong commitment to democracy and human rights. The instrument has generated genuine results and numerous success stories, providing support to civil society and human rights institutions worldwide as well as election observation. Due to its independence from Government consent and its flexibility, the EIDHR represents a key added value to the EU’ policy toolbox. The general objectives and the scope of the EIDHR which are to contribute to the development and consolidation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law worldwide, must be preserved in the new Regulation. Recent developments in the European Neighbourhood, in particular the Arab Spring, have shown that there is a strong home-grown demand for increased freedoms and rights together with democracy that the ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered three options (with some sub-options): Option 1 : No separate EIDHR Regulation and mainstream human rights and democracy under other instruments; Option 2 : no change to the current regulation with only an increase in the budget allocation that will provide for additional activities under the current framework; Option 3 : building a better enabling regulation, while preserving the key features of the existing Regulation. The third option was retained as it would allow preserving the political and operational benefits of the instruments, while allowing for a better adaptation of the regulation. Under this option, the new draft should be built as a better enabling regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 202 and 209 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this draft Regulation proposes to establish a new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights under which the Union shall provide assistance to the development and consolidation of Such assistance shall aim in particular at: enhancing the respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international and regional human rights instruments, and strengthening their protection, promotion and monitoring, mainly through support to relevant civil society organisations, human rights defenders and victims of repression and abuse; supporting and consolidating democratic reforms in third countries, by enhancing participatory and representative democracy, strengthening the overall democratic cycle, and improving the reliability of electoral processes, in particular by means of election observation missions. Scope and fields of action : Union assistance shall relate to the following fields: support to and enhancement of participatory and representative democracy, including parliamentary democracy, and the processes of democratisation, mainly through civil society organisations; promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international and regional instruments concerning civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, mainly through civil society organisations; strengthening of the international framework for the protection of human rights, justice, the rule of law and democracy, and for the promotion of international humanitarian law; building confidence in and enhancing the reliability and transparency of democratic electoral processes, while contributing to the efficiency and consistency of the whole electoral cycle. The promotion and protection of gender equality, the rights of the child, rights of indigenous peoples, rights of persons with disabilities, and principles such as empowerment, participation, non-discrimination of vulnerable groups and accountability shall be taken into account whenever relevant for all assistance measures referred to in this Regulation. The assistance measures shall take into account the specific features of crisis or urgency situations and countries or situations where there is a serious lack of fundamental freedoms, where human security is most at risk or where human rights organisations and defenders operate under the most difficult conditions. Geographical scope : the assistance measures shall be implemented in the territory of third countries or shall be directly related to situations arising in third countries, or shall be directly related to global or regional actions. General Framework for programming and implementation : Union assistance under this Regulation shall be implemented through the following measures and in accordance with the Common Implementing Regulation: Strategy Papers and revisions thereof as appropriate; Annual Action Programmes, individual measures and support measures; Strategy papers shall set out the priority areas selected for financing by the Union during the period of validity of this Regulation, the specific objectives, the expected results and the performance indicators. They shall In accordance with the Council decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service (EEAS)5 , the High Representative/Vice-President shall ensure overall political coordination of the Union’s external action, including through the EIDHR.

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: The present Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide. In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the number of people living in poverty continues to be a major problem in developing countries. While significant progress has been achieved, most developing countries remain off-track for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and are not able to successfully embark on the path of sustainable development in all its senses. To aggravate the situation, global challenges continue to be prominent and developing countries were hit hard by the succession of recent crises resulting inter alia in social and economic instability, increased migration, food insecurity and an increased vulnerability to external shocks, among other effects. It is increasingly recognised that environmental and natural resources, vital for sustainable socio-economic growth, are increasingly at risk from climate change and rapid population growth. The EU remains committed to helping developing countries to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty. To achieve this objective, the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) Regulation was established for the 2007-2013 period with the primary and overarching objective of eradicating poverty in partner countries and regions. This instrument consists of three categories of programmes: i) bilateral and regional geographic programmes covering cooperation with Asia, Latin America, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Africa ; ii) thematic programmes covering the following issues: investing in people, environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy, non-State actors and local authorities, food security, and migration and asylum; and iii) accompanying measures for sugar-producing countries. The current DCI regulation expires on 31 December 2013. The various reviews undertaken of the DCI have acknowledged its overall added value and its contribution to the achievement of the MDGs, but have also highlighted certain shortcomings. New challenges, together with the priorities set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the latest EU development policy, have prompted the Commission to make a proposal to review and adapt the DCI Regulation in line with the 2011 communication ""Increasing the Impact of EU Development Policy: An Agenda for Change"". IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an Impact Assessment (IA) that considered 3 basic policy alternatives: Option 1 : maintaining the DCI Regulation without any amendment and Option 2 : two alternatives for amending the DCI on each problem identified in the current DCI (Options 2A and 2B). Option 1 was not accepted because it would not solve the problems identified. Sub-options A and B under Option 2 solve the identified problems to different extents, each having particular political and other implications. The IA concluded that sub-option B is better as it differentiates clearly amongst partner countries and it streamlines the thematic programmes to provide the necessary flexibility to facilitate a more effective EU response to rapidly evolving situations in crisis, post-crisis and fragile states. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission establishes an instrument designed to finance: geographic programmes aimed at supporting cooperation with developing countries, territories and regions set out in the Annex to the Regulation (46 countries are concerned), which are included in the list of recipients of Official Development Assistance (ODA) of the OECD/DAC; thematic programmes to address global public goods and challenges and support civil society organisations and local authorities in countries, territories and regions eligible for Union funding under the European Neighbourhood Instrument, and ACP countries signatories to the Cotonou Agreement; a Pan-African programme to support the Joint Africa-EU Strategy in the countries, territories and regions covered by that Strategy. Objectives and eligibility criteria : the Regulation lays down the objectives and eligibility criteria for DCI II, as well as the EU’s development cooperation geographic and thematic programmes. The proposed regulation thus provides for the support of all forms of cooperation in developing countries. It requires fulfilling the criteria for ODA, subject to possible exceptions for the thematic and Pan-African programmes. For these programmes, a 10% flexibility for non-ODA activities is foreseen to cover for expenditure which; although not strictly speaking ODA-compliant, may be required for the adequate implementation of actions under these programmes. General principles: the proposal sets out the main principles governing the implementation of the Regulation, which are: democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law; differentiated approach towards the partner countries, taking into account their needs, capacities, commitments and performance, and potential EU impact; key cross-cutting issues (such as gender equality and women empowerment); strengthened coherence of EU external action; improved coordination with the Member States and other bilateral or multilateral donors; and a partner country-led and region-led development process with mutual accountability, through an inclusive and participatory approach to development, using effective and innovative cooperation modalities thus improving the impact of aid and reducing overlap and duplication. Geographic and Thematic programmes : the Regulation lays down the guiding principles: for the thematic programmes by means of which the EU assistance will be provided; the possible areas for cooperation and distinguishes between regional and bilateral cooperation. Differentiation : the principle of differentiation will be applied as often as possible. As a consequence, bilateral development assistance would be provided to those partner countries which need it the most, and lack the required financial capacities for their own development. Also, the differentiation principle takes into account the potential impact of the Union assistance in partner countries. Partner countries that shall benefit from bilateral development assistance are listed in the Annex to the Regulation. This Annex does not include countries ""graduated"" according to the following criteria: partner countries representing more than 1% of the world's GDP and/or upper middle income countries according to the list of recipients of ODA are in principle excluded. However, additional criteria relating to their need and capacity are used, such as Human Development Index, the Economic Vulnerability Index and aid dependency, as well as economic growth and foreign direct investment. Also the reliability of the available data is taken into consideration. All partner countries, however, would still benefit from regional and thematic programmes. Areas of intervention : the Regulation does not restrict the areas of EU cooperation or intervention. Any listing of such areas is purely illustrative. Areas may be chosen because they are pertinent to achieving the aims laid down in the Treaty, to the EU's international obligations and commitments or to the specific objectives provided for in the agreements with partner countries and regions. They should nevertheless be proposed with reference to the EU's objective of concentrating assistance, with a view to ensuring that the EU's policy and the policies of the Member States complement each other Thematic programmes : actions undertaken within thematic programmes bring an added value to actions financed under the geographic programmes. The characteristics of thematic programmes may be summarised as follows: Global Public Goods and Challenges : these actions will target the main global goods and challenges in a flexible and cross cutting manner. The main fields of activities that will be pursued by this programme include, inter alia, environment and climate change, sustainable energy, human development (including health, education, gender equality, employment, skills, social protection and social inclusion as well as economic development-related aspects such as growth, jobs, trade and private sector engagement), food security and migration and asylum. This thematic programme will enable swift response in view of unforeseen events and global crises (e.g. the food price crisis, avian flu). Civil Society Organisations and Local Authorities: programme in favour of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and Local Authorities (LAs) thematic which is based on the former Non-State Actors and Local Authorities programme. The focus of this programme has been sharpened with more attention given to capacity development of CSOs and LAs. The programme will promote an inclusive and empowered civil society and local authorities, increase awareness and mobilisation on development issues, and strengthen the capacity for policy dialogue on development. Pan-African programme : the Pan-African Programme is being set up to implement the Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES). It will be complementary and coherent with other financial instruments, notably the ENI, the EDF and the thematic programmes under DCI. While ENI and EDF focus on interventions at the regional or national level in Africa, the Pan-African programme shall be used to provide specific support for the objectives of the JAES, supporting in particular activities of transregional, continental and trans-continental nature, as well as relevant JAES initiatives in the global arena. Programming and allocation of funds : this article of the proposal lays down the general framework for geographical and thematic programming, as well as for the allocation of the funds under this Regulation. To ensure synergies and complementarity of the Union’s measures and those of the Member States, the Member States will be fully involved in the programming process. The consultation process will also include other donors and development actors as well as civil society and regional and local authorities. Provision is, in particular, made for the following: programming documents for geographic programmes with an indicative allocation and multiannual indicative programmes. These also list exceptions for when a strategy paper would not need to be prepared in order to simplify the programming process as well as to favour joint programming with Member States. The strategy papers will be drafted in dialogue with the partner countries and regions, with relevant involvement of the civil society and regional and local authorities; a Joint Framework Document that would lay down a comprehensive Union strategy, of which development policy would be part; Multiannual Indicative Programmes (MIP ) based on any programming documents, except when the total allocation would not exceed 30 million EUR. MIPs can be adjusted through a mid term or ad hoc review, in view of achieved objectives as well as in light of newly identified needs, such as those resulting from crisis, post-crisis or fragility situations. Flexibility : the draft regulation provides that a certain amount should not be allocated in order to increase the instrument’s flexibility and its ability to react to unexpected events (new priorities, natural or man-made disasters, etc.). Other provisions are made for: Programming for countries in crisis, post-crisis or fragility situation emphasising the special needs and circumstances of countries in crisis, post-crisis or fragility situation and providing for a special procedure in this case; Programming documents for thematic programmes may undergo a mid-term review; Approval of Strategy Papers and adoption of Multiannual Indicative Programmes. Coherence and complementarity : to make Union assistance more coherent and effective, and in particular to avoid programmes being split up among several different instruments, the proposed Regulation lays out the possibility to extend the eligibility of this Regulation to include all third countries, territories and regions, insofar as this contributes to the general objectives of the Regulation. Implementation : implementation has been considerably simplified, with an article stipulating that the Regulation shall be implemented in accordance with the future Regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. BUDGETARY IMPACT: in line with the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 establishing the budget for Europe 2020, the Commission proposes to allocate EUR 23.2947 billion to this instrument for the period 2014-2020. It is planned that no less than 50% of the programme for Global Public Goods and Challenges will be spent on climate change and environmental objectives and at least 20% on social inclusion and human development. Continued support for social inclusion and human development is foreseen through at least 20% of the Union's development aid. Lastly, this Regulation intends to contribute to addressing at least 20% of the Union's budget to creating low carbon and climate resilient societies. DELEGATED ACTS: it is proposed that flexibility be reinforced by using delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty to make it possible to amend certain non-essential elements of the Regulation that affects the subsequent programming (e.g. annexes on eligible countries, areas for cooperation and indicative financial allocation per programme for 2014-2020)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’  the Commission recognised the need to provide, for the duration of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014 – 2020, specific, one-off support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes triggered by the increasing globalisation of production and trade patterns. As in the 2007-2013 programming period, this specific support should be provided through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), one of the existing special instruments whose mobilisation does not affect the expenditure ceilings of the MFF. In the same Communication the Commission indicated that through the EGF the Union should also be able to provide support in the event of large-scale redundancies resulting from a serious disruption of the local, regional or national economy caused by an unexpected crisis. The scope of the EGF will furthermore be extended to provide transitory support to farmers to facilitate their adaptation to a new market situation resulting from the conclusion by the Union of trade agreements affecting agricultural products. The prime objective of this proposal is to ensure that the EGF continues to operate in the next programming period in line with the basic principles laid down for the MFF 2014 – 2020, which also extended its scope. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considered three options for the EGF: Option 1 – No policy change , i.e. the EGF continues without its own budget. Following each application the budgetary authority has to take a decision whether this particular situation merits support. The main disadvantage is the long delay caused by the administrative procedures surrounding the decision- making process. The main advantages are the flexibility of the instrument, in particular taking into account the largely unpredictable nature of the expenditure, the awareness it raises in the European Parliament of mass redundancies, the high visibility of each application as well as the high visibility of the EGF itself. Option 2 – Incorporation of EGF actions into the ESF. The main disadvantages are the need for a clear budget allocation during the programming period despite the 'unprogrammable' nature of mass redundancies, the possible conflict with overall allocation criteria used in cohesion policy and a reduction of the political visibility of Union support as the budgetary authority would not be involved. The main advantages of this option are increased coherence and complementarity with the ESF, the shortening of the decision-making process and the simplification and streamlining of EGF applications as the EGF could benefit from ESF structures, procedures, management and control systems as well as ESF simplifications in areas such as eligible costs. Option 3 – the EGF as a stand-alone fund with its own budgetary allocation . The main disadvantages are the loss of budgetary flexibility as it would earmark for a variable expenditure pattern a fixed amount of expenditure, the delivery mechanism (a negative impact on the delivery mechanism compared with option 2 as the EGF would not benefit from ESF structures, procedures and simplification) and finally the risk of some overlap with the ESF. The main advantage is the high degree of visibility for European solidarity. The assessment has shown that in terms of speed of delivery of EGF assistance options 2 and 3 are preferable. However, these options involve a higher risk of reduced efficiency because of non-use of allocated resources. The involvement of policy makers in option 1 guarantees the highest level of public commitment of the Union to the welfare of redundant workers. Therefore, option 1 is the preferred option, offering as it does the necessary flexibility to enable effective use of resources, without affecting the Multiannual Financial Framework. LEGAL BASIS: the third paragraph of Article 175, as well as Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to ensure that the EGF continues to operate in the next programming period in line with the basic principles laid down for the MFF 2014-2020. The main provisions of this proposal may be summarised as follows: Scope : the EGF will provide support in cases: where workers have been made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns, in line with the initial scope of the EGF as laid down in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006; where workers made redundant as a result of a serious disruption of the local, regional or national economy caused by an unexpected crisis (comparable to the financial and economic crisis that hit the economy from 2008 onwards) provided that a direct and demonstrable link can be established between the redundancies and that crisis; to help farmers adjust to a new market situation resulting from a trade agreement, such as an agreement on agricultural products concluded by the Union. Examples of such possible forthcoming trade agreements are those under negotiation with Mercosur countries, or in the context of the World Trade Organisation under the Doha Development Agenda. Intervention criteria : in order to ensure that the EGF remains a valid European-level instrument, an application for EGF support for workers can be triggered when the number of redundancies reaches a minimum threshold. Experience with the functioning of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 has shown that a threshold of 500 redundancies within a given reference period is acceptable, in particular taking into account the possibility to submit applications for a lower number of redundancies in small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances. For the agricultural sector ,an EGF application would be triggered on a different basis. Ex-ante information about the sectors and / or products likely to be affected by increased imports as a direct result of trade agreements will be provided in the analysis carried out by the Commission departments for the trade negotiations. Once the trade agreement is initialled, the Commission departments further check the sectors or products for which a substantial increase in Union imports and a significant drop in prices are expected and will assess the likely effect on sectoral income. On this basis the Commission would designate agricultural sectors or products and, where relevant, regions as eligible for possible EGF support. Member States would have the possibility to submit applications for an EGF contribution, provided that they can prove that eligible sectors experience significant trade-related losses, that farmers operating in these sectors are affected and that they have identified and targeted the affected farmers. As the access to EGF support is conditioned by the fact that the workers must have been made redundant, or for farmers that they are adjusting that part of their activity affected by the relevant trade agreement, the proposal contains specific provisions on how the redundancy should be counted for each worker. Revision of the notion of ‘workers’ : in order to ensure that EGF support is available to workers independently of their contract of employment or employment relationship, the notion of 'workers' is extended to include not only workers with contracts of employment of indefinite duration as in Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, but also workers with fixed-term contracts, temporary agency workers and owner-managers of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed workers (including farmers). The EGF is designed to contribute to the growth and employment objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Therefore, its focus is on active labour market measures aimed at reintegrating dismissed workers rapidly into stable employment. As does Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, this proposal provides for a financial contribution from the EGF for a package of active labour market measures. It cannot contribute to the funding of passive measures as these are not compatible with the growth and employment objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Allowances may only be included if they are designed as incentives to facilitate the participation of dismissed workers in active labour market policy measures. In order to ensure a reasonable balance between genuinely active labour market policy measures and 'activated' allowances, the share of allowances in a coordinated package of active labour market measures is capped. For farmers , including all members of the farm household active on the farm, the measures would focus on the acquisition of appropriate training and skills and use of advisory services enabling them to adjust their activities, including carrying out new activities, within and / or outside agriculture, as well as to support to a limited extent the initial investments in changing or adjusting their activities so as to assist them to become structurally more competitive and secure their livelihoods. Support could also be given to cooperation activities with a view to creating new market options especially for small-scale farmers. Application and intervention deadlines : the effectiveness of the EGF has suffered from the length and procedural requirements of the decision-making process. Shortening as much as possible the time lag between the date of application for EGF support and the date of payment, and simplifying the procedures, should be a common concern for all parties involved in the EGF process: Member States should strive to submit a complete application as soon as possible once the relevant criteria are met; the Commission should assess and conclude on eligibility soon after the submission of a complete application; the budgetary authority should swiftly take its decision on deploying the EGF funding. In order to cover the needs arising at the beginning of the year, the Commission will continue to propose within the annual budgetary procedure a minimum amount in payment appropriations for the relevant budgetary line. In view of the unpredictable nature of the needs arising for support from the Fund, it is necessary to reserve a part of the annual maximum amount for applications receiving financial contributions after 1 September each year. In case the needs for support from the Fund exceed the amount remaining available, the Commission’s proposals will reflect the proportion set for support of the agricultural sector during the duration of the MFF. Complementarity, compliance and coordination : assistance from the EGF will be in addition to the efforts of the Member States, at national, regional and local levels. For reasons of sound financial management the EGF cannot replace measures that are already covered by Union Funds and Programmes included in the MFF. Nor can the EGF financial contribution replace measures that are the responsibility of dismissing companies under national law or collective agreements. Budget procedure : the budget procedure in the proposal follows directly from point 13 of the draft Interinstitutional Agreement. Whenever possible, the process will be shortened and streamlined. Taking account of the fact that the measures co-funded by the EGF are implemented by means of shared management with the Member States, the payment mechanism for the financial contribution will remain in line with those applied for this management mode of the Union budget. At the same time, the financing arrangements should reflect the scope of the actions to be carried out by the Member States as proposed in their applications. The co-funding rate will be modulated, with a 50% contribution to the cost of the package and its implementation as the norm, and the possibility to raise this rate to 65% in the case of applications submitted by those Member States on the territory of which at least one region at NUTS II level is eligible under the ""Convergence"" objective of the Structural Funds. The purpose of this modulation is to ensure that the Union’s expression of solidarity with workers in these Member States and regions is not hampered by a lack of Member State co-funding resources, as recognised by the higher co-funding rates laid down under the Structural Funds. The Commission, in its assessment of such applications, will decide whether the higher co-funding rate is justified in the specific case proposed by the Member State. One of the key messages for the period 2014-2020 is that expenditure at Union level should be result-oriented, thus ensuring that the output and impact of the expenditure push forward the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and the achievement of its targets. For expenditure related to the EGF the MFF sets the target that at least 50% of workers assisted through the EGF should find a new and stable job after 12 months. Implementing reports : Member States will present an interim report on the implementation of EGF support after 15 months. Within the same results-oriented approach the proposal provides for the possibility that Member States, subject to approval by the Commission, can amend the planned active labour market policy measures if in the course of the 24-month implementation period other measures become more relevant and promising to reach a higher reintegration rate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EGF is one of the special instruments not included in the MFF, with a maximum amount from January 2014 to 31 December 2020 of EUR 3 billion, while the amount in support of the agricultural sector shall not exceed EUR 2.5 billion (2011 prices). It may not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 429 million. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates - a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges - are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by Decision 2012/419/EU, the European Council amended the status of Mayotte with regard to the Union with effect from 1 January 2014. Therefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be an overseas territory to become an outermost region within the meaning of Articles 349 and 355(1) TFEU. Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014. This proposal follows the examination of requests made by the French authorities to have the Union acquis amended through derogations and/or transitional periods applicable to Mayotte in different areas, such as environment, agriculture, social policy and public health. The examination has revealed that France needs additional time to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte in these fields. The amendments proposed relate to all the Directives. In the interest of simplicity and speediness, it has been considered expedient not to resort to individual proposals for each of the acts concerned but, where legally possible, to bundle the amendments to several acts in a single proposal.

LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2), Article 114, Article 153(2), Article168 and Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: taking into account the specific situation in Mayotte, the Commission is proposing to amend a series of Directives in the fields of the environment, agriculture, social policy and public health. Environment: it is proposed to amend three Directive in order to: (i) grant France the sufficient periods of time for meeting the requirements of the Directives concerning urban waste water treatment and for the adoption and the proper implementation of river basin management plans; (ii) define specific time limits to allow France to reach the Union standards as regards bathing water quality. Agriculture: it is proposed to amend Council Directive 1999/74/EC laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens. Since laying hens are reared in Mayotte in unenriched cages and since it would be difficult to change this position in the short term, France should be granted sufficient time to adapt. Social policy: it is proposed to amend Directive 2006/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with a view to granting a derogation to France, until 31 December 2017, from certain provisions in the field of artificial optical radiation. It is also proposed that France must ensure proper consultation of the social partners and limit risks for workers to a minimum. Public health: it is proposed to amend Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, to grant France an additional period of 30 months from 1 January 2014 to bring into force the provisions necessary to comply with that Directive in respect of Mayotte .

In the area of fisheries, the proposed amendments aim to: include the waters around Mayotte and to prohibit the use of purse-seines on tuna and tuna-like schools of fish inside the area within 24 miles from the baselines of the island in order to preserve the shoals of large migratory fish in the vicinity of the island of Mayotte; grant additional time to France to to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte, in particular in regard to the registering and control obligations in the area of fisheries, to the extent it concerns certain vessels dispersed around the island and not associated to a specific landing site. In the area of animal health, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to grant France a transitional period of five years in regard to Mayotte, which would enable it to create the infrastructure necessary for the identification, handling, transport, treatment and disposal of animal by-products.

BACKGROUND: while emissions from other sectors are generally falling, road transport is one of the few sectors where emissions have risen rapidly. Between 1990 and 2008 emissions from road transport increased by 26%. As a result, it is the second biggest source of GHG emissions in the EU, and contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of CO2. In March 2011 the Commission adopted the 'Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system'. It sets out a transport strategy within a frame of achieving a 60% reduction in transport GHG emissions by 2050. Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 sets the CO2 reduction framework for the new van fleet to 2020. It operates in two steps. In the first period to 2017 the modalities of compliance with the targets have been established. For the second period to 2020 the target cannot become effective without implementing the necessary modalities, which are to be determined in a review. The Commission is requested to confirm that the 2020 van target is feasible. Failure to determine or implement the modalities would have a detrimental effect on vehicle manufacturers and parts suppliers who need certainty with regard to the technology and vehicles that will be needed to meet the target. Key modalities in the current Regulation include the limit value curve which is defined by the utility parameter and the function describing the relationship between the utility parameter and CO2 emissions (setting the shape and slope). Other modalities include the excess emissions premium scheme, eco-innovations, derogations, pooling, the phasing-in of the targets and granting of super-credits for a limited period of time. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a joint impact assessment supporting the current proposal and a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 has been prepared. The following aspects were analysed: (a) 'do nothing' option; (b) modalities of meeting the car target; (c) simplification and reduction of administrative burden; (d) adaptation to the new test cycle; (e) form and stringency of legislation beyond 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal confirms the feasibility of the average target of 147 g CO2/km for new light commercial vehicles to be reached in 2020. It proposes to define the modalities of reaching the target as follows: · the utility parameter continues to be vehicle's mass in running order · the limit value curve remains linear with a slope of 100% compared to the baseline fleet ; · manufacturers responsible for less than 500 registrations of new light commercial vehicles per year are excluded from the obligation to meet their specific emissions target; · more flexibility is allowed in the timing of decisions granting small-volume derogations ; · eco-innovations are retained when a revised test procedure is implemented ; · excess Emissions Premium is maintained at €95 per g/km per vehicle. As industry benefits from indications of the regulatory regime that would apply beyond 2020, the proposal includes a further review to take place by 31 December 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it has become more and more apparent that consumer policy is one area which can make a telling contribution to meeting the Europe 2020 objectives. In Europe there are 500 million consumers and consumer expenditure amounts to 56% of EU GDP. The more consumers are able to make informed decisions, the greater the impact they can have on strengthening the Single Market and stimulating growth. However, empowerment is not only a question of consumer rights but of building an overall environment that enables consumers to make use of those rights and benefit from them. The Communication 'A budget for Europe 2020' of 29 June 2011 allocated funds to the Consumer Programme for the period 2014-2020, and this proposal aims at establishing a Consumer Programme for the period 2014-2020, as a successor to the 2007-2013 Programme of Community Action in the field of consumer policy. The new Consumer Programme will support the general objective of future consumer policy placing the empowered consumer at the centre of the Single Market. The actions under the new Programme are grouped in the following four categories: ·  to consolidate and enhance product Safety through effective market surveillance throughout the EU; ·  to improve consumers' education, information and awareness of their rights, to develop the evidence base for consumer policy and to provide support to consumer organisations; ·  to consolidate consumer rights in particular through regulatory action and improving access to redress including alternative dispute resolution; ·  to support enforcement of consumer rights by strengthening cooperation between national enforcement bodies and by supporting consumers with advice. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment considered four options: ·  Option 0 corresponds to the absolute minimum actions to be financed resulting from the legal obligations imposed by the Treaty and the existing EU acquis in the field of consumer protection. ·  Option 1 corresponds to the baseline scenario. Under this option, the majority of actions conducted under the 2007-2013 Programme are pursued, with some adaptation. Some actions are substantially reduced or no longer implemented because they are no longer relevant, while some new actions are launched with a limited level of ambition (for instance on redress). It corresponds to a budget equal to or lower than the one provided under the current Programme. ·  Option 2 corresponds to a more ambitious approach in line with Commission priorities (Europe 2020, Single Market Act) and the on-going reflection on the future of consumer policy. The budget under this option is around EUR 25 millions annually. ·  Option 3 would require a budget increase compared to the current Programme for some additional actions such as the development of a public consumer product safety Database, and in matters of redress: setting up a fund to support the financing of cross-border redress actions. The impact assessment has concluded that option 2 is the best option from a cost/benefit point of view. LEGAL BASIS: Article 169 TFUE. CONTENT : the aim of the Consumer Programme is to contribute to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers, as well as to promote their right to information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests. The Programme will complement, support and monitor the policies of Member States. The actions will support the following four specific objectives: Objective 1 - safety : to consolidate and enhance product safety through effective market surveillance throughout the Union. This objective will be measured in particular through the activity of the EU rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products (RAPEX). Objective 2 - information and education : to improve consumers' education, information and awareness of their rights, to develop the evidence base for consumer policy and to provide support to consumer organisations. Objective 3 - rights and redress : to consolidate consumer rights in particular through regulatory action and improving access to redress including alternative dispute resolution. This objective will be measured in particular through the recourse to alternative dispute resolution to solve cross-border disputes and through the activity of a Unionwide on-line dispute resolution system. Objective 4 - enforcement : to support enforcement of consumer rights by strengthening cooperation between national enforcement bodies and by supporting consumers with advice. This objective will be measured in particular through the level of information flow and cooperation within the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network and the activity of the European Consumer Centres. The description of the indicators is provided in Annex II, and the Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts to modify the indicators. Eligible actions : the proposal sets out the selected areas for actions which are of three kinds: Actions corresponding to legal obligations imposed by the Treaty and the existing EU acquis in the field of consumer protection on the EU and Member States. This involves financing the maintenance and proper functioning of the RAPEX Network, of the CPC Network of enforcement authorities and of the cosmetics databases. Actions which are not or could not be undertaken at national level because of their EU-level character: ·  assisting consumers on cross-border issues by co-financing the operation of the Network of European Consumer Centres (ECCs) and by supporting the development of a Union-wide on-line dispute resolution system dealing also with cross-border cases; ·  developing cooperation with international partners to deal with the impact of the globalisation of the production chain on product safety; ·  supporting the production of EU-level comparable consumer markets data for benchmarking between Member States and input into EU-level policy-making; ·  ensuring EU-level representation of consumer interests by financially supporting EU-level consumer organisations. Actions complementing and enhancing the efficiency of measures undertaken at national level: ·  coordination and co-financing of joint actions in the field of product safety and of consumer rights enforcement; ·  supporting awareness-raising campaigns on consumer issues with Member States and other stakeholders and working with intermediaries to contribute to the provisions of clear, transparent and reliable information to consumers; ·  supporting the training of national consumer organisations, which would be much more costly at national level without economy of scale; ·  providing a platform for exchange and sharing of good practices in the field of consumer education. A more detailed description of the content that those actions may have is included in Annex I. Participation of third countries in the Programme : participation in the Programme shall be open to the participation of: ·  the countries of the European Free Trade Associations participating in the European Economic Area; ·  third countries, in particular acceding and candidate countries as well as potential candidates, and countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy applies. Types of intervention and maximum level of co-financing : financial contributions by the Union may take the form of either grants or public procurement. The proposal describes in detail the types of intervention in relation to eligible actions. Grants for the functioning of consumer organisations at Union level may be awarded to European consumer organisations, which comply with certain conditions set out in the proposal as well as grants for eligible actions. Financial framework and co-financing : the financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme shall be EUR 197,000,000 from 2014 to 2020. The rate of co-financing depends on the type of action being financed, Grants for functioning range from 50% to 95% of eligible costs in certain cases. Grants for action range from 50% to 70% of eligible costs. Administrative and technical assistance : the financial allocation for the Programme may also cover expenses pertaining to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities which are required for the management of the programme and the achievement of its objectives; in particular, studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions, including corporate communication of the political priorities of the Union, expenses linked to IT networks focusing on information processing and exchange, together with all other technical and administrative assistance expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme. Methods of implementation : the Commission shall implement the Programme. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers will be conferred on the Commission in respect of the adoption of annual work programmes. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Consistency and complementarity with other policies: the Commission shall, in cooperation with the Member States, ensure overall consistency and complementarity between the Programme and other relevant Union policies, instruments and actions. Evaluation and dissemination of results : standard clauses for monitoring, control, dissemination and anti-fraud measures are inserted in the proposal. Report: no later then mid-2018, an evaluation report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of all the measures (at the level of results and impacts), the efficiency of the use of resources and its European added value, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the measures. Repeal: Decision No 1926/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council is repealed from 1 January 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial appropriations for implementing the Programme over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 will amount to EUR 197 millions in current prices. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU is delegated to the Commission in respect of the adaptation of the indicators set out in Annex II. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: Article 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""delegated acts"" (Article 290(3)). Article 291 of the TFEU allows Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""implementing acts"" (Article 291(4)). As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred upon the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 774/94 need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t here was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact analysis since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) 774/94 with the TFEU is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal consists in aligning Council Regulation (EC) No. 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty. Regulation (EC) No 774/94 confers powers on the Commission allowing it to adopt the necessary implementing measures. It also confers powers on the Commission to adopt adjustments to that Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular by a decision to approve an agreement with one or more third countries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 774/94, the relevant implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: Article 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""delegated acts"" (Article 290(3)). Under Article 291 of the TFEU, Member States adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""implementing acts"" (Article 291(4)). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact analysis since the proposal to align Council Regulations (EC) No 2008/97, (EC) No 779/98 and (EC) No 1506/98 with the TFEU is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he objective of the present proposal consists in aligning three Council Regulations in the field of imports of olive oil and other agricultural products from Turkey with those provisions of the TFEU. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred upon the Commission under those regulations need to be aligned. It is necessary to re-classify the powers conferred upon the Commission into delegated and implementing powers and to amend the regulations above. In order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 2008/97, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of the resulting adjustments necessary for that Regulation where the present conditions of the special arrangements provided for in the Association Agreement are amended, in particular as regards the amounts, or where a new agreement is concluded. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 2008/97, (EC) No 779/98 and (EC) No 1506/98, the relevant implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no financial impact on budgetary expenditure and revenue."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EEC) N° 1601/91 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatised wines, aromatised wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails  and Commission Regulation (EC) No 122/94 have proved successful in regulating the aromatised wines, aromatised wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails, hereinafter called “aromatised wine products”. However, in the light of technologic innovation, market developments and evolving consumer expectations it is necessary to update the rules applicable to the definition, description, presentation, labelling and protection of geographical indications of certain aromatised wine products, while taking into account traditional production methods. This proposal replaces Commission proposal which the Commission decided to withdraw in the 2011 Commission Work Programme which has been communicated to the other institutions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. The main European producers and national organisations were consulted informally and did not expect significant impacts. A consensus exists among the producers of aromatised wine products to keep the same framework and similar rules; only minor technical adjustments seem to be necessary. Those were communicated to the Commission services by the representatives of the sector. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal simplifies the existing rules by introducing limited changes to improve the readability and clarity of the rules on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products as well as on the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products. Alignment with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) : one of the main objectives of the present proposal consists in aligning Council Regulation (EEC) N° 1601/91 on new comitology rules: the objectives and principles and other essential elements regarding the definition, the description, the presentation, the labelling and the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products are determined by the Legislator; the Commission should be able to adopt, by means of a delegated act, in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU, the production processes, the methods of analysis, the necessary amendments of the definitions, the requirements, the restrictions, the sales denominations and the descriptions, the necessary rules for the geographical indications and the necessary rules for exchange of information; the Legislator should grant the Commission the power to adopt implementing acts, in accordance with Article 291(2) of the Treaty, specifically with regard to the uniform application of the rules on aromatised wine products related to geographical indications, to administrative and physical checks and to exchange of information. Other amendments : the proposal does not change the scope of the existing rules for the sector, and has no significant impact as it corresponds to an adaptation to obligations already taken on by the Union. In particular, the proposal: enhances applicability, readability and clarity of the Union legislation on aromatised wine products; introduces a well defined quality policy for aromatised wine products based on the present definitions of products; updates certain sales denominations, in the light of the possibility to increase the level of wine instead of directly adding alcohol, and so ensuring that the consumer is properly informed; adapts the Union rules to new technical requirements; adapts the Union rules to WTO requirements, including the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement (TRIPs agreement). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: public procurement plays a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. The award of works concessions is presently subject to basic rules of Directive 2004/18/EC on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts while the award of services concessions with a cross-border interest is subject to the principles of the Treaty, and in particular the principle of free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services as well as to the principles deriving therefrom such as equal treatment, non-discrimination, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency. There is a risk of legal uncertainty related to different interpretations of the principles of the Treaty by national legislators and of wide disparities among the legislations of different Member States. Such risk has been confirmed by the extensive case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union but which has only partially addressed certain aspects of the award of concession contracts. The absence of clear rules at Union level governing the award of concession contracts gives rise to legal uncertainty and to obstacles to the free provision of services and causes distortions in the functioning of the Internal Market. As a result, economic operators, in particular Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are being deprived of their rights within the Internal Market and miss out on important business opportunities, An adequate legal framework for the award of concessions would ensure effective and non-discriminatory access to the market to all Union economic operators and legal certainty, favouring public investments in infrastructures and strategic services to the citizen. Hence, a uniform concretisation of the Treaty principles across all Member States and the elimination of discrepancies in their understanding following therefrom is necessary at the Union level in order to eliminate persisting distortions of the Internal Market. The Commission announced the intention to adopt a legislative initiative on concessions in its communication “The Single Market Act Twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence” of 13 April 2011. This draft is being put forward in tandem with the revision of Public Procurement Directives (COD/2011/0438 and COD/2011/0439). It will result in the adoption of a separate legal instrument regulating the award of concessions which, together with the two proposals to revise Public Procurement Directives (2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC), aims at creating a modern public procurement legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the final impact assessment report confirmed the need for new legislation. It found that economic operators are faced with an unlevel playing field, which often leads to missed business opportunities. The optimal solution identified was legislation based on the current provisions on public works concessions, adequately adjusted and supplemented with certain specific provisions. A more restrictive approach, would be to extend to concessions the provisions that apply to public contracts. This approach was considered counter-productive in that it could potentially discourage contracting authorities from using concessions. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53 (1), Article 62 and Article 114 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposed Directive is expected to guarantee transparency, fairness and legal certainty in the award of concession contracts, and thereby contribute to improved investment opportunities and ultimately to more and better quality of works and services. It will apply to concessions awarded after its entry into force. This provision is in line with rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union on modifying contracts. (1) Legal certainty : the main objective of the Directive is to provide for clarity on the legal framework applicable to the award of concessions, but another is to clearly delimit the scope of application of this framework. Definition : the present proposal for a Directive on the award of concession contracts provides for a more precise definition of concession contracts with reference to the notion of operational risk. It makes clear what types of risk are to be considered operational and how to define significant risk. It also provides references as to the maximum duration of concessions. Incorporation of Treaty obligations into secondary law : the proposal extends the majority of the obligations which currently apply to the award of public works concessions to all services concessions. . It also lays down a number of concrete and more precise requirements, applicable at different stages of the award process on the basis of the Treaty principles, as interpreted in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Moreover, it extends the application of secondary law to the award of concession contracts in the utilities sector, which is currently exempt from such legislation. Public-public cooperation : there is considerable legal uncertainty as to how far cooperation between public authorities should be covered by public procurement rules. The relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union is interpreted differently between Member States and even between contracting authorities. Hence the present proposal clarifies the cases in which contracts concluded between contracting authorities are not subject to the application of concession award rules. Such clarification is guided by the principles set out in the relevant case law of the Court of Justice. Modifications : a specific provision on modifying concessions incorporates the basic solutions developed in the case law and provides a pragmatic solution for dealing with unforeseen circumstances requiring an a concession to be modified during its term. (2) Better access to the concessions markets: the proposal provides for a fundamental improvement economic operators' access to the concessions markets. The provisions are primarily designed to increase the transparency and fairness of award procedures by restricting the arbitrariness of contracting authorities and contracting entities' decisions on such issues as prior and post-publication, procedural safeguard, selection and award criteria and the deadlines imposed on tenderers. Furthermore, they provide for a better access to justice in order to prevent or to address violations of those provisions. Publication in the Official Journal : in order to ensure transparency and equal treatment to all economic operators, the present proposal provides for compulsory publication of concession contracts with a value equal to or greater than EUR 5 000 000. Deadlines : this proposal also sets a minimum deadline for the submission of interest in any concession award procedure, amounting to 52 days, as this is currently the case for public works concessions. It has been decided to provide for concessions a longer deadline than in case of public contracts, given that concession contracts are usually more complex. Selection and exclusion criteria : the rules are less restrictive than similar provisions currently applicable to public contracts. However, they restrict the selection criteria to those related to the economic, financial and technical capacity of the bidder and limit the scope of the acceptable exclusion criteria. Award criteria : the proposal provides for an obligation to apply objective criteria linked to the subject matter of the concession, ensuring compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment, guaranteeing that tenders are assessed in conditions of effective competition allowing an overall economic advantage for the contracting authority or the contracting entity to be determined. These criteria should prevent arbitrary decisions by contracting authorities and contracting entities and must be published in advance and listed in descending order of importance. Member States or contracting authorities or contracting entities which so wish, may also provide for or apply the ‘most economically advantageous tender’ criterion for the award of concessions. Procedural guarantees : unlike the Public Procurement Directives, the proposed rules do not contain a fixed catalogue of award procedures. This solution allows contracting authorities and contracting entities to follow more flexible procedures when awarding concessions notably reflecting national legal traditions and permitting the award process to be organised in the most efficient way. However, the proposal establishes a number of clear procedural safeguards to be applied to the award of concessions notably during negotiations. These safeguards aim at ensuring that the process is fair and transparent. Remedies : this proposal provides for an extension of the scope of application of the Remedies Directives (Directives 89/665/EEC and 92/13/EC, as amended by Directive 2007/66/EC) to all concession contracts above the threshold in order to guarantee effective channels for challenging the award decision in court and provide minimal judicial standards which have to be observed by contracting authorities or entities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: p ublic procurement plays an important role in the overall economic performance of the European Union. In Europe, public authorities spend around 18 % of GDP on supplies, works and services. Given the volume of purchases, public procurement can be used as a powerful lever for achieving a Single Market fostering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. A comprehensive economic evaluation has shown that the public procurement Directives have achieved their objectives to a considerable extent. They have resulted in greater transparency and higher levels of competition while achieving measurable savings through lower prices. The Commission published on 27 January 2011 a Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy — Towards a more efficient European Procurement Market launching a broad public consultation on options for legislative changes to make the award of contracts easier and more flexible and enable public contracts to be put to better use in support of other policies. A very large majority of stakeholders appreciated the initiative of the Commission to review the current public procurement policy. They voiced demand for a review of the public procurement directives to simplify the rules, increase their efficiency and effectiveness and make them better suited to deal with the evolving political, social and economic context. This proposal has two complementary objectives: Increase the efficiency of public spending to ensure the best possible procurement outcomes in terms of value for money. This implies in particular a simplification and flexibilisation of the existing public procurement rules. Streamlined, more efficient procedures will benefit all economic operators and facilitate the participation of SMEs and cross-border bidders. Allow procurers to make better use of public procurement in support of common societal goals such as protection of the environment, higher resource and energy efficiency, combating climate change, promoting innovation, employment and social inclusion and ensuring the best possible conditions for the provision of high quality social services. This initiative implements the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiatives on a Digital Agenda for Europe, the Innovation Union, an Integrated Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, Energy 2020 and a Resource Efficient Europe. It also implements the Single Market Act, in particular its twelfth key action ‘Revised and Modernised Public Procurement Legislative Framework’. Together with the proposed new utilities Directive, the proposal will replace Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC as the core elements of the European Union public procurement legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment and its executive summary give an overview of the different options for each of the five groups of basic problems (administrative organisation, scope, procedures, strategic procurement and access to procurement markets). Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the different options, a package of preferred options was identified that should optimise the synergies between the different solutions allowing savings due to one type of action to neutralise related costs caused by another (e.g. possible increased procedural requirements caused by strategic procurement actions could partially be neutralised by savings related to the improved design of procurement procedures). These preferred options form the basis of the present proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1), Article 62 and Article 114 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the main axes of the proposal are as follows: (1) Simplification and flexibilisation of procurement procedures Clarification of scope: the basic concept of ‘procurement’ has been newly introduced in order to better determine the scope and purpose of procurement law and to facilitate the application of the thresholds. The definitions of certain key notions determining the scope of the Directive (such as body governed by public law, public works and service contracts, mixed contracts) have been revised in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice; the traditional distinction between so-called prioritary and non-prioritary services (‘A’ and ‘B’ services) will be abolished . However, it became also clear that the regular procurement regime is not adapted to social services which need a specific set of rules. Toolbox approach: Member State systems will provide two basic forms of procedure, open and restricted procedure. They may, in addition, foresee, subject to certain conditions, the competitive procedure with negotiation, the competitive dialogue and/or the innovation partnership, a new form of procedure for innovative procurement; contracting authorities will furthermore have at their disposal a set of six specific procurement techniques and tools intended for aggregated and electronic procurement: framework agreements, dynamic purchasing systems, electronic auctions, electronic catalogues, central purchasing bodies and joint procurement. Compared to the existing Directive, these tools have been improved and clarified with a view to facilitating e‑procurement. Lighter regime for sub-central contracting authorities: in line with the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, the proposal provides a simplified procurement regime that applies to all contracting authorities below the central government level, such as local and regional authorities. These purchasers may use a prior information notice as a means of calling for competition. If they make use of this faculty, they don’t have to publish a separate contract notice before launching the procurement procedure. Promotion of e-procurement: the proposal aims at helping Member States to achieve the switchover to e-procurement enabling suppliers to take part in online procurement procedures across the Internal Market. It provides for the mandatory transmission of notices in electronic form, the mandatory electronic availability of the procurement documents and imposes the switch to fully electronic communication, in particular e-submission, in all procurement procedures within a transition period of two years. Modernisation of procedures: time-limits for participations and submission of offers have been shortened . The distinction between selection of tenderers and award of the contract which is often a source of errors and misunderstandings has been made more flexible, allowing it for contracting authorities to decide on the most practical sequencing by examining award criteria before selection criteria and to take into account the organisation and quality of the staff assigned to performing the contract as an award criterion; the grounds for exclusion of candidates and tenderers have been reviewed and clarified . Contracting authorities will be entitled to exclude economic operators which have shown significant or persistent deficiencies in performing prior contracts. The proposal provides also for the possibility of ‘self-cleaning’: contracting authorities may accept candidates or tenderers in spite of the existence of an exclusion ground if they have taken appropriate measures to remedy the consequences of any illicit behaviour and effectively prevent further occurrences of the misbehaviour; the modification of contracts during their term has become an increasingly relevant and problematic issue for practitioners. A specific provision on modification of contracts takes up the basic solutions developed by case-law and provides a pragmatic solution for dealing with unforeseen circumstances requiring an adaption of a public contract during its term. (2) Strategic use of public procurement in response to new challenges: the proposed Directive is based on enabling approach providing contracting authorities with the instruments needed to contribute to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategic goals by using their purchasing power to procure goods and services that foster innovation, respect the environment and combat climate change while improving employment, public health and social conditions. Life-cycle costing : the proposal gives public purchasers the possibility to base their award decisions on life-cycle costs of the products, services or works to be purchased. Production process : contracting authorities may refer to all factors directly linked to the production process in the technical specifications and in the award criteria, as long as they refer to aspects of the production process which are closely related to the specific production or provision of the good or service purchased. This excludes requirements not related to the process of producing the products, works or services covered by the procurement, such as general corporate social responsibility requirements covering the whole operation of the contractor. Labels : contracting authorities may require that works, supplies or services bear specific labels certifying environmental, social or other characteristics, provided that they accept also equivalent labels. Sanctioning violations of mandatory social, labour or environmental law : under the proposed Directive, a contracting authority can exclude economic operators from the procedure, if it identifies infringements of obligations established by Union legislation in the field of social, labour or environmental law or of international labour law provisions. Social services : The evaluation on the impact and effectiveness of EU public procurement legislation has shown that social, health and education services have specific characteristics which make them inappropriate for the application of the regular procedures for the award of public service contracts. These services are typically provided within a specific context that varies widely between Member States due to different administrative, organisational and cultural circumstances. The services have, by their very nature, only a very limited cross-border dimension. Member States should therefore have large discretion to organise the choice of service providers. The proposal takes account of this by providing a specific regime for public contracts for these services, with a higher threshold of EUR 500 000 and imposing only the respect of basic principles of transparency and equal treatment. Innovation : the proposal provides for this purpose the innovation partnership, a new special procedure for the development and subsequent purchase of new, innovative products, works and services, provided they can be delivered to agreed performance levels and costs. (3) Better access to the market for SMEs and Start-ups Simplification of information obligations : the proposal provides for the mandatory acceptance of self-declarations as prima-facie evidence for selection purposes. The actual production of documentary evidence will be facilitated by a standardised document, the European Procurement Passport which is a means of proof for the absence of grounds for exclusion. Division into lots : contracting authorities will be invited to divide public contracts into — homogeneous or heterogeneous — lots to make them more accessible for SMEs. Limitation on requirements for participation : to avoid unjustified barriers in the way of participation by SMEs, the proposed Directive contains an exhaustive list of possible conditions for participation in procurement procedures. Turnover requirements which are frequently a formidable obstacle to access by SMEs are explicitly limited to three times the estimated contract value, except in duly justified cases. Finally, any conditions for participation by groups of economic operators — an instrument of particular relevance for SMEs — must be justified by objective reasons and proportionate. Direct payment of subcontractors : Member State can provide that subcontractors may request for direct payment by the contracting authority of supplies, works and services provided to the main contractor in the context of the contract performance. (4) Sound procedures Conflicts of interest : the proposal contains a specific provision on conflicts of interest covering actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest situations affecting staff members of the contracting authority or of procurement service providers intervening in the procedure and members of the contracting authority’s management who may influence the outcome of a procurement procedure even if they are not formally involved in it. Illicit conduct : the proposal contains a specific provision against illicit behaviour by candidates and tenderers, such as attempts to improperly influence the decision-making process or entering into agreements with other participants to manipulate the outcome of the procedure have to be excluded from the procedure. Unfair advantages : the proposal contains a specific provision on safeguards against undue preference in favour of participants who have advised the contracting authority or been involved in the preparation of the procedure. (5) Governance National oversight bodies : the proposal provides that Member States designate a single national authority in charge of monitoring, implementation and control of public procurement. Knowledge centres : the proposal obliges Member States to provide support structures offering legal and economic advice, guidance, training and assistance in preparing and conducting procurement procedures. To reinforce the fight against corruption and favouritism, contracting authorities will be obliged to transmit the text of concluded contracts to the oversight body. However, the creation of disproportionate administrative burden must be avoided; the obligation to transmit the full text of concluded contracts should therefore remain limited to relatively high value contracts. The thresholds proposed would strike the right balance between increasing administrative burden and ensuring greater transparency: with a threshold of EUR 1 000 000 for supplies and services, and of EUR 10 000 000, this obligation would apply to 10 - 20 % of all procurement published in the Official Journal. Administrative cooperation : the proposal provides also for effective cooperation allowing national oversight bodies to share information and best practices and to cooperate through the Internal Market Information System (IMI).

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: p ublic procurement plays an important role in the overall economic performance of the European Union. In Europe, public authorities spend around 18 % of GDP on supplies, works and services. Given the volume of purchases, public procurement can be used as a powerful lever for achieving a Single Market fostering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. A comprehensive economic evaluation has shown that the public procurement Directives have achieved their objectives to a considerable extent. They have resulted in greater transparency and higher levels of competition while achieving measurable savings through lower prices. The Commission published on 27 January 2011 a Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy — Towards a more efficient European Procurement Market launching a broad public consultation on options for legislative changes to make the award of contracts easier and more flexible and enable public contracts to be put to better use in support of other policies. A very large majority of stakeholders appreciated the initiative of the Commission to review the current public procurement policy. They voiced demand for a review of the public procurement directives to simplify the rules, increase their efficiency and effectiveness and make them better suited to deal with the evolving political, social and economic context. This proposal has two complementary objectives: Increase the efficiency of public spending to ensure the best possible procurement outcomes in terms of value for money. This implies in particular a simplification and flexibilisation of the existing public procurement rules. Streamlined, more efficient procedures will benefit all economic operators and facilitate the participation of SMEs and cross-border bidders. Allow procurers to make better use of public procurement in support of common societal goals such as protection of the environment, higher resource and energy efficiency, combating climate change, promoting innovation, employment and social inclusion and ensuring the best possible conditions for the provision of high quality social services. This initiative implements the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiatives on a Digital Agenda for Europe, the Innovation Union, an Integrated Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, Energy 2020 and a Resource Efficient Europe. It also implements the Single Market Act, in particular its twelfth key action ‘Revised and Modernised Public Procurement Legislative Framework’. Together with the proposed new utilities Directive, the proposal will replace Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC as the core elements of the European Union public procurement legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment and its executive summary give an overview of the different options for each of the five groups of basic problems (administrative organisation, scope, procedures, strategic procurement and access to procurement markets). Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the different options, a package of preferred options was identified that should optimise the synergies between the different solutions allowing savings due to one type of action to neutralise related costs caused by another (e.g. possible increased procedural requirements caused by strategic procurement actions could partially be neutralised by savings related to the improved design of procurement procedures). These preferred options form the basis of the present proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1), Article 62 and Article 114 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the main axes of the proposal are as follows: (1) Simplification and flexibilisation of procurement procedures Clarification of scope : the basic concept of “procurement” which appears also in the title of the proposed Directive has been newly introduced in order to better determine the scope and purpose of procurement law and to facilitate the application of the thresholds. The definitions of certain key notions determining the scope of the Directive (such as body governed by public law, public works and service contracts, mixed contracts) have been revised in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice; the notion of special or exclusive rights is central to the definition of the scope of this Directive, since entities which are neither contracting authorities not public undertakings within the meaning of this Directive are subject to this Directive only to the extent that they exercise one of the activities covered on the basis of such rights. It is therefore appropriate to clarify that rights which have been granted by means of a procedure in which adequate publicity has been ensured and where the granting of those rights was based on objective criteria, notably pursuant to Union legislation, do not constitute special or exclusive rights for the purposes of this Directive; the traditional distinction between so-called priority and non-priority services (“A” and “B” services) will be abolished. The results of the evaluation have shown that it is no longer justified to restrict the full application of procurement law to a limited group of services. However, it became also clear that the regular procurement regime is not adapted to social services which need a specific set of rules; the scope in terms of sectors covered remains largely unchanged. However, procurement made for the purpose of exploring oil and gas has been withdrawn from the scope as that sector has been found to be subject to such competitive pressure that the procurement discipline brought about by the Directive is no longer needed. Toolbox approach : Member State systems will provide the three basic forms of procedure which already exist under current Directives: open and restricted procedures as well as negotiated procedures with prior call for competition. They may, in addition, foresee either as standard procedure or subject to certain conditions the innovation partnership, a new form of procedure for innovative procurement; contracting entities will furthermore have at their disposal a set of six specific procurement techniques and tools intended for aggregated and electronic procurement: framework agreements, dynamic purchasing systems, electronic auctions, electronic catalogues, central purchasing bodies and joint procurement. Compared to the existing Directive, those tools have been improved and clarified with a view to facilitating e-procurement. Promotion of e-procurement: the proposal provides for the mandatory transmission of notices in electronic form, the mandatory electronic availability of the procurement documents and imposes the switch to fully electronic communication, in particular e-submission, in all procurement procedures within a transition period of two years. Modernisation of procedures : time-limits for participations and submission of offers have been shortened . The distinction between selection of tenderers and award of the contract which is often a source of errors and misunderstandings has been made more flexible, allowing contracting entities to decide on the most practical sequencing by examining award criteria before selection criteria and to take into account the organisation and quality of the staff assigned to performing the contract as an award criterion; the procedure for exemption of contracts awarded in sufficiently competitive markets (the current “Article 30 decisions”) has been simplified and streamlined. A number of exemptions, in particular the intra-group and joint venture exemptions which are important in practice have also been reviewed and clarified; the modification of contracts during their term has become an increasingly relevant and problematic issue for practitioners. A specific provision on modification of contracts takes up the basic solutions developed by case-law and provides a pragmatic solution for dealing with unforeseen circumstances requiring an adaption of a public contract during its term. (2) Strategic use of public procurement in response to new challenges: the proposed Directive is based on enabling approach providing contracting authorities with the instruments needed to contribute to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategic goals by using their purchasing power to procure goods and services that foster innovation, respect the environment and combat climate change while improving employment, public health and social conditions. Life-cycle costing : the proposal gives purchasers the possibility to base their award decisions on life-cycle costs of the products, services or works to be purchased. Production process : contracting entities may refer to all factors directly linked to the production process in the technical specifications and in the award criteria, as long as they refer to aspects of the production process which are closely related to the specific production or provision of the good or service purchased. This excludes requirements that are not related to the process of producing the products, works or services covered by the procurement, such as a general corporate social responsibility requirement covering the whole operation of the contractor. Labels: contracting entities may require that works, supplies or services bear specific labels certifying environmental, social or other characteristics, provided that they accept also equivalent labels. Sanctioning violations of mandatory social, labour or environmental law : under the proposed Directive, a contracting authority can exclude economic operators from the procedure, if it identifies infringements of obligations established by Union legislation in the field of social, labour or environmental law or of international labour law provisions. Social services : the services have, by their very nature, only a very limited cross-border dimension. Member States should therefore have large discretion to organise the choice of service providers. The proposal takes account of this by providing a specific regime for public contracts for these services, with a higher threshold of EUR 1 000 000 and imposing only the respect of basic principles of transparency and equal treatment. Innovation : the proposal provides for this purpose the innovation partnership, a new special procedure for the development and subsequent purchase of new, innovative products, works and services, provided they can be delivered to agreed performance levels and costs. (3) Better access to the market for SMEs and Start-ups Simplification of information obligations : it is foreseen that contracting entities may apply the selection criteria provided for in the proposed Directive on public procurement and that, where they do, they are then obliged to apply the provisions concerning notably the ceiling to requirements on minimum turnover as well as the provisions on in particular self-certification. Better access to framework agreements : under the current Directives, there is no limitation to the duration of framework agreements concluded in the utilities sectors. This can lead to market foreclosure. The proposal limits the duration to four years (except in duly justified circumstances). Direct payment of subcontractors : Member State can provide that subcontractors may request for direct payment by the contracting authority of supplies, works and services provided to the main contractor in the context of the contract performance. (4) Sound procedures Conflicts of interest : the proposal contains a specific provision on conflicts of interest covering actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest situations affecting staff members of the contracting authority or of procurement service providers intervening in the procedure and members of the contracting authority’s management who may influence the outcome of a procurement procedure even if they are not formally involved in it. Illicit conduct : the proposal contains a specific provision against illicit behaviour by candidates and tenderers, such as attempts to improperly influence the decision-making process or entering into agreements with other participants to manipulate the outcome of the procedure have to be excluded from the procedure. Unfair advantages : the proposal contains a specific provision on safeguards against undue preference in favour of participants who have advised the contracting authority or been involved in the preparation of the procedure. (5) Governance National oversight bodies : the proposal provides that Member States designate a single national authority in charge of monitoring, implementation and control of public procurement. Knowledge centres : the proposal obliges therefore Member States to provide support structures offering legal and economic advice, guidance, training and assistance in preparing and conducting procurement procedures. To reinforce the fight against corruption and favouritism, contracting authorities will be obliged to transmit the text of concluded contracts to the oversight body, which will thus be able to scrutinize these contracts for suspicious patterns, and give access to these documents to interested persons to the extent that legitimate public or private interests are not jeopardized. Administrative cooperation : the proposal provides also for effective cooperation allowing national oversight bodies to share information and best practices and to cooperate through the Internal Market Information System (IMI). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

BACKGROUND: Decision 804/2004/EC established the Hercule I programme and Decision 878/2007/EC extended this programme over the period 2007 to 2013, as Hercule II. The latter placed specific emphasis on the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting to reflect the legal obligations of the Commission stemming from the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeiting Agreement with Philip Morris International signed in 2004. It was the first of the agreements signed with international cigarette manufacturers under which, in recognition of more than US$ 2 billion to be paid by them into national and the Union Budgets over periods of up to 20 years, the Commission and Member States agreed that European efforts to suppress the illegal traffic in tobacco products would be enhanced. The annual provision for Hercule was duly increased from 2007. As the legal basis for Hercule II will expire at the end of 2013, its replacement should ensure the continuity of European support for the activities carried out by the Commission and Member States in providing better information, carrying out studies and providing training or technical and scientific assistance in the fight against fraud. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the protection of the Union's financial interests against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union is a shared responsibility between the Commission and Member States. The Hercule III programme concerns this specific sphere of activity of the Commission and its cooperation with Member States’ competent authorities, as well as with the other European institutions and bodies, particularly OLAF. It is essential that there should continue to be an instrument specifically dedicated to fighting fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an impact assessment. Four options, with their impact on the budget, were considered. Option 1 : to continue the programme with the same level of funding (baseline scenario); Option 2 : to renew the Hercule programme with improved objectives and a better methodology, including in particular a higher maximum rate of co-financing for technical support such as the procurement of equipment; Option 3 : to significantly alter the distribution between the different spending objectives and put much greater support on operational and law enforcement activities; Option 4 : discontinue the Hercule programme, with the possibility of continuing some actions under other Union co-financing programmes and/or to leave other actions to the Member States. In view of the past experience, the option to renew the programme with improved objectives and a better methodology is the preferred option (option 2) with a budgetary envelope in real prices which remains similar to the current envelope (approximately EUR 15 million per year). In contrast, Option 3 would result in an imbalance to the detriment of specific support for actions of prevention and detection of fraud and it might lead to confusion with regard to the attribution of responsibilities between Member States and the European Union. Member States are primarily responsible for the fight against fraud. Discontinuing the programme would reduce expenditure at Union level, without creating real economies and offsetting resources at national level or in the framework of another Union programme. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325 TFEU. CONTENT: this proposal establishes the Hercule III programme to promote activities against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. This objective shall be measured, inter alia, through the amount of recoveries following fraud cases detected by joint actions and cross border operations, the increased percentage of successful joint operations, and the increased number of cases accepted by the criminal investigative authorities. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Purpose: the aims are to: · target exclusively the protection of the financial interests of the Union, in the context of a long term vision which is coherent with other Union objectives, on the basis of the priorities defined each year for this specific field of expertise; · allow the implementation of other Union programmes to focus on priorities other than the protection of the financial interests; · fully take into account the results of the actions already co-financed in the past in this field, including in terms of targeted beneficiaries and geographical balance; · have direct impact on not only some Member States investigations, but also on OLAF investigations. Added value: the programme in particular creates savings deriving from the collective procurement of specialised equipment and databases to be used by the stakeholders and those derived from the collective specialised training. An increased effectiveness of the cross-border operations is expected on the basis of common technical standards and joint training. The Programme shall contribute to: · developing the activities at Union level and the Member States to counter fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, including the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting; · an increased transnational cooperation at the Union level and in particular to the effectiveness of the cross-border operations; · an effective prevention of fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, by offering joint specialised training for staff of national, regional administrations and to other stakeholders. Bodies eligible for funding : these are (i) national or regional administrations of a Member State or a third country which promote the strengthening of action at Union level to protect the Union's financial interests; (ii) research and educational institutes and non-profit making entities provided that they have been established and have been operating for at least one year, in a Member State or in a third country. Eligible actions : the Programme shall provide financial support for the following actions: (a) Provision of specialised technical assistance for national authorities through: · providing specific knowledge, specialised and technically advanced equipment and effective information technology (IT) tools facilitating transnational cooperation and cooperation with the Commission; · ensuring the necessary support and facilitating investigations, in particular the setting up of joint investigation teams and cross border operations; · supporting Member States' capacity to store and destroy seized cigarettes as well as independent analytical services for the analysis of seized cigarettes; · enhancing staff exchanges for specific projects, in particular in the field of the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting; · providing technical and operational support for the law enforcement authorities of the Member States in their fight against illegal cross border activities and fraud affecting the Union financial interests, including in particular support for customs authorities; · building information technology capacity throughout the Member States and third countries by providing specific databases and IT tools facilitating data access and analysis; · increasing data exchange, developing and providing IT tools for investigations, and monitoring intelligence work. (b) Organisation of specialised training, and risk analysis training workshops, as well as conferences, aimed at: · further fostering better understanding of Union and national mechanisms; · exchanging experience between the relevant authorities in Member States, and third countries as well as representatives of international organisations, including specialised law enforcement services; · coordinating the activities of Member States, third countries, and international public organisations; · disseminating knowledge, particularly on better identification of risk for investigative purposes; · developing high-profile research activities, including studies; · improving cooperation between practitioners and academics; · further raising the awareness of the judiciary and other branches of the legal profession for the protection of the financial interests of the Union. (c) Any other action, provided by the annual work programmes, which is necessary for attaining the general and specific objectives provided for in the text. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the programme will cover the period 2014-2020, and the overall budgetary envelope is EUR 110 000 000 in current prices. This amount is in line with the Commission's Communication on the next Multi-Annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: ''A Budget for Europe 2020''."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal aims at enabling Greenland to participate in the Kimberley Process certification scheme on rough diamonds through its cooperation with the European Union. The scheme set out in the proposal would allow for the import and export of rough diamonds from Greenland to the Union as well as to other participants of the certification scheme, provided that all imports and exports of rough diamonds are verified and, for exports, certified by Union authorities pursuant to the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the international trade in rough diamonds. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Greenland and Denmark undertake to transpose and implement in the legislation applicable to Greenland the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the conditions and formalities for importing and exporting rough diamonds, their transit to a participant other than the Union, the participation of the Union, including Greenland, in the Kimberley Process certification scheme and associated obligations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal extends the territory of the Union to also cover the territory of Greenland for the purposes of the Kimberley Process certification scheme. Accordingly, Greenland will be prohibited to accept imports or exports of rough diamonds to or from outside of the territory of the Union without a valid Kimberley Process (KP) certificate. The amendments will allow for the export of rough diamonds from Greenland to third countries as long as they are accompanied by an EU KP certificate. The conditions for certification previously required evidence that the rough diamonds were lawfully imported into the Union. For diamonds mined and extracted in Greenland that have never been exported before, an alternative condition is introduced by this proposal, notably to demonstrate proof in this regard. In addition, the proposal: sets out the modalities of submitting rough diamonds to Union authorities for verification, extends the special rules for transit to Greenland. enables Greenland's participation in the Committee for the implementation of the Regulation, and enables Greenland's representation in the Kimberley Process and cooperation with other Member States through the Commission. The proposal is closely connected to a proposal for a Council Decision setting out specific rules for the circulation of rough diamonds between the Union and Greenland. The application of that Decision is proposed to align with the entry into force of this amendment to the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 establishes common technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and as such is an important building block in the realisation of a single euro payments area (SEPA). That Regulation sets 1 February 2014 as the end-date in the Eurozone for the migration of domestic as well as intra-European credit transfers and direct debits in euros towards SEPA credit transfers (SCT) and SEPA direct debits (SDD). Considering the low migration pace in some Member States for SCT and in most Member States for SDD, it appears very unlikely that the SEPA migration will be fully completed on 1 February 2014. However, in view of this legal end-date, banks and other payment service providers are likely to refuse from that date onwards to process legacy payments which are not SEPA compliant. In the absence of full migration to SCT/SDD, payment incidents leading to delays in payment or market disruptions cannot be excluded. These might affect all payment services users, and particularly SMEs and consumers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is not accompanied by a separate impact assessment, as an impact assessment for Regulation (EU) No. 260/2012 has already been undertaken. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 by introducing a grandfathering clause allowing banks and other payment service providers to continue also after 1 February 2014, for a limited period of time of 6 months, the processing of non-compliant payments through their legacy payments schemes alongside SCT and SDD. A clear communication of such amendment will provide certainty to the payment service users that their payments will continue to be processed after 1 February 2014, and it will allow those that have not yet migrated to do so as rapidly as possible. Under all circumstances, on-going information campaigns on the SEPA migration should continue. At the end of the grandfathering period, the Commission will not hesitate to take the necessary steps to ensure the full application of EU law by the Member States. In view of the above and given the very short period of time left before 1 February 2014, this Regulation should be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council as a matter of urgency and enter into force without delay. The proposal provides that the amendment applies as of 31 January 2014. This provision also allows for a retro-active application in case the proposal is not adopted by the European Parliament and the Council before 1 February but just after this date. This will avoid a legislative gap as of 1 February 2014 which would create legal uncertainty. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have a budgetary impact for the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the CLP Regulation entered into force in 2009 in order for the EU to implement the United Nations Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). The aim is to protect workers, consumers and the environment by means of labelling and indicating any potential hazardous effects of chemicals. The CLP Regulation is expected to facilitate global trade and harmonised communication of information on hazards posed by chemicals and to promote regulatory efficiency. It will complement the REACH Regulation. Directives 92/58/EEC, 92/85/EEC, 94/33/EC, 98/24/EC6 and 2004/37/EC contain references to EU chemical classification and labelling legislation. If these Directives are to remain effective, they need to be aligned to the CLP Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the proposed amendments to the five Directives maintain the current level of worker protection without additional requirements of significant impact, a formal impact assessment was not carried out. A full impact assessment for the CLP Regulation was presented during 2007. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the aim of the Directive is to update references and terminology of the five above-mentioned Directives in order to bring them into line with the applicable EU chemical classification and labelling legislation. In doing so, no changes to the scope or level of protection provided by these Directives are required. Regarding the non-exhaustive list of agents mentioned in the Annex, Part I, Section 3 of Directive 94/33/EC, an exact correlation between the pre-existing and new chemical classification systems cannot be achieved. The proposal therefore presents an alignment that may result in a limited number of additional substances coming within the scope of the Annex. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the dissemination of content which is protected by copyright and related rights and the linked services, including books, audiovisual productions and recorded music require the licensing of rights by different holders of copyright and related rights, such as authors, performers, producers and publishers. Such services may be provided offline, such as showing a film in a cinema or playing music in a concert hall, but also increasingly online. In some sectors, licences are most often granted directly by individual rightholders (e.g. film producers). In other sectors, the collective management of rights plays a very important role, in particular of authors' rights in musical works. Collecting societies enable rightholders to be remunerated for uses which they would not be in a position to control or enforce themselves, including in non-domestic markets. Moreover, they have an important social and cultural role as promoters of the diversity of cultural expressions by enabling the smallest and less popular repertoires to access the market. The Commission recommends action in two areas. · Firstly, there are significant differences in the national rules governing the functioning of collecting societies, in particular as regards their transparency and accountability towards their members and rightholders. Collective rights' management in all sectors needs to adapt in terms of the service provided to members and users as regards efficiency, accuracy, transparency and accountability. · Secondly, in the licensing of the rights of authors in musical works, online music service providers face difficulties in acquiring licences with an aggregated repertoire for the territory of more than one Member State. This situation leads to fragmentation of the EU market for these services, thereby limiting the provision of online music services by online service providers. This proposal is presented in the context of the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Europe 2020 Strategy. In its ""Single Market Act"" the Commission underlined that, in the internet age, collective management must be able to evolve towards more transnational, possibly EU-wide models of licensing. In its Communication ""A Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights"" the Commission announced that it would be proposing a legal framework for the collective management of copyright and related rights. The importance of this legislative proposal was also highlighted in the Commission's ""European Consumer Agenda"". IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment examines two groups of options to deal with: (1) options pertaining to governance and transparency standards in collecting societies are as follows: · retaining the status quo (A1); · better enforcement (A2) of existing EU law; · the codification of existing principles (A3) reflecting in legislation the principles that have emerged from the case-law of the Court of Justice, the Commission's antitrust decisions and Recommendation 2005/737/EC; · a governance and transparency framework (A4) which would codify the existing principles and provide a more elaborate framework of rules on governance and transparency, increasing the possibilities of control over collecting societies. (2) The following policy options were examined to address the complexities of the collective licensing of authors' rights in musical works for online uses: · retaining the status quo (B1); · the European Licensing Passport (B2): this would foster the voluntary repertoire aggregation for online uses of musical works at EU level and the licensing of rights through multi-territorial licensing infrastructures. It would lay down common rules for all collective licensors throughout the EU and would create competitive pressure on societies to develop more efficient licensing practices; · parallel direct licensing (B3); · extended collective licensing and country of origin principle (B4); · a centralised portal (B5). After carefully weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches, options A4 (governance and transparency framework) and B2 (European Licensing Passport) were retained. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 50(2)(g), 53 and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal for a directive aims to put in place an appropriate legal framework for the collective management of rights that are administered by collecting societies on behalf of rightholders. It aims to: · improve the standards of governance and transparency of collecting societies so that rightholders can exercise more effective control over them and help improve their management efficiency; · facilitate the multi-territorial licensing by collecting societies of authors' rights in musical works for the provision of online services. (1) Collecting societies : the proposal establishes organisational and transparency rules which apply to all types of collecting societies. It provides, inter alia: · rules governing the membership organisation of collecting societies; · rules on collecting societies’ financial management: a collecting society must: (i) specify the applicable deductions in its agreements with rightholders; (ii) assure members and rightholders fair access to any social, cultural or educational services, if funded by deductions; (iii) pay the amounts due to rightholders accurately and without undue delay and make efforts to identify rightholders. · rules on levels of disclosure: (i) information to rightholders on amounts collected and paid, management fees charged and other deductions made; (ii) information to other collecting societies on the management of rights under representation agreements; (iii) information to rightholders, other societies and users on request; (iv) annual publication of a transparency report. (2) Multi-territorial licensing by authors' collecting societies of online rights in musical works: the proposal establishes the conditions that an authors' collecting society must respect when providing multi-territorial licensing services for online rights in musical works, namely: · being able to process efficiently and transparently the data needed for the exploitation of such licences by using a time-sensitive, authoritative database containing the necessary data; · being transparent as regards the online music repertoire it represents; · offering rightholders and other societies the possibility to correct the relevant data and to ensure their accuracy; · monitoring the actual usage of the works covered by the licences, being capable of processing usage reports and invoicing; · paying rightholders and other collecting societies without delay and provide them with information on works used and financial data related to their rights (e.g. amounts collected, deductions made). In order to ensure that repertoires can be easily aggregated for the benefit of music service providers who want to offer a service as complete as possible across Europe and for the benefit of cultural diversity and consumers at large, specific safeguards will apply to ensure that the repertoire of all societies have access to multi-territorial licensing. The proposal also ensures that collecting societies put in place complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures so that these are available for members and rightholders. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. BACKGROUND: adopted in early 2003, the Market Abuse Directive (MAD) 2003/6/EC introduced a comprehensive framework to tackle insider dealing and market manipulation practices, jointly referred to as ""market abuse"". However, experience has shown that the objective of the Directive, to increase investor confidence and market integrity, has not been achieved. The report by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU recommended that a sound prudential and conduct of business framework for the financial sector must rest on strong supervisory and sanctioning regimes. To this end, the Group considers that supervisory authorities must be equipped with sufficient powers to act and should be able to rely on equal, strong and deterrent sanctions regimes against all financial crimes, sanctions which should be enforced effectively. However, the High-Level Group considers that none of these is currently in place"" and Member States sanctioning regimes are regarded as in general weak and heterogeneous. The Commission has published a Communication with regard to sanction regimes in the financial sector. It concluded that the Commission will assess whether the introduction of criminal sanctions, and the establishment of minimum rules on the definition of criminal offences and sanctions may prove to be essential in order to ensure the effective implementation of EU financial services legislation Following the approach set out in the Communication of 20 September 2011 ""Towards an EU criminal policythe Commission considers that minimum rules on criminal offences and on criminal sanctions for market abuse, which would be transposed into national criminal law and applied by the criminal justice systems of the Member States, can contribute to ensuring the effectiveness of this Union policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options related to criminal sanctions were considered as part of this preparatory work. One of the problems identified in the impact assessment is the fact that the sanctions currently in place to fight market abuse offences are lacking impact and are insufficiently dissuasive, which results in ineffective enforcement of the Directive. In addition, the definition of which insider dealing or market manipulation offences constitute criminal offences diverges considerably from Member State to Member State. For example, five Member States do not provide for criminal sanctions for disclosure of inside information by primary insiders and eight Member States do not do so for secondary insiders. Since market abuse can be carried out across borders, this divergence undermines the internal market and leaves a certain scope for perpetrators of market abuse to carry such abuse in jurisdictions which do not provide for criminal sanctions for a particular offence. The impact assessment concluded that requiring Member States to introduce criminal sanctions for the most serious market abuse offences was essential to ensure the effective implementation of the Union policy on market abuse. LEGAL BASIS: Article 83 (2) of the TFEU. CONTENT: proposals to strengthen and ensure the coherence of administrative sanctions are included in the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on insider dealing and market manipulationthat also intends to remedy other major problems in the existing system. This proposal lays down a requirement for Member States to provide for minimum rules on the definition of the most serious market abuse offences and on minimum levels of criminal sanctions attached to them. The main points are as follows: Criminal offences: two forms of market abuse conduct, namely insider dealing and market manipulation, should be regarded as criminal offences if committed intentionally. The attempt to commit insider dealing and market manipulation should also be punishable as a criminal offence. The offence relating to inside information should apply to persons who possess inside information of which they know that it is inside information. The offence relating to market manipulation is applicable to anybody. Inciting, aiding and abetting and attempt: the proposal provides that inciting as well as aiding and abetting the defined criminal offences are also punishable in Member States. The attempt to commit one of the offences defined in the Directive is also covered, with the exception of improper disclosure of inside information and dissemination of information which gives false or misleading signals, as it does not seem appropriate to define attempts to commit these offences as criminal offences. Criminal sanctions: the proposal requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the criminal offences identified in the text are subject to criminal sanctions. These sanctions should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Liability of legal persons: the proposal requires Member States to ensure that legal persons can be held liable for the criminal offences defined in the directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (replacing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : this proposal follows the judgment of the European Court of Justice annulling Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union and maintaining the effects of the Regulation until a new regulation has been adopted on the appropriate legal basis. The Court's ruling of 6 September 2012 was decided after the European Parliament took legal action against the Council in October 2010 contesting the legal basis used for the adoption of Regulation 617/2010 and requesting the Court to annul it (Case C-490/10). The Council used Articles 337 TFEU and 187 of the Euratom Treaty as the legal bases, on the grounds that the Regulation relates to the activity of collecting general information. Following Parliament's request, the Court annulled Regulation 617/2010, but maintained its effects until a new regulation is adopted on the correct legal basis within a reasonable period of time Obtaining an overall picture of the development of investment in energy infrastructure in the Union is essential for the Commission to perform its tasks in the field of energy. In order to comply with the Court's judgement and to ensure continuity in the observation of investment projects in energy infrastructure, the Commission proposes a Regulation with the same content as the annulled Regulation and suggests a few adaptations, which are necessary due to the new legislative process. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given that an impact assessment was carried out when Regulation 617/2010 was proposed and that the content of the proposed regulation is the same as that of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010, the Commission did not carry out a new impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes a common framework for the notification to the Commission of data and information on investment projects in energy infrastructure in the petroleum, gas, electricity and bio-fuel sectors and related to carbon dioxide produced by these sectors. The scope of this proposed regulation is identical to that of the annulled Regulation . Member States are required to notify the Commission every two years of data and information on investment projects concerning production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas, electricity (including electricity from renewable sources), biofuels and the capture and storage of carbon dioxide. Investments to be notified to the Commission include : (i) projects both planned and under construction; (ii) transformation of existing infrastructure as well as (iii) decommissioning projects of a certain size, on a five-year horizon, in the territory of Member States, including interconnections with third countries. Undertakings concerned should be under an obligation to notify the Member State of the data and information in question. The only modifications concern the new legislative procedure (ordinary legislative procedure), the date for a review of the act (31 December 2016 instead of 23 July 2015) and the date for reporting. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will have a limited impact on the Community budget. Expenditure will cover information technology and, should the Commission so decide, purchasing of data and reimbursement of experts. There should be no direct impact on Member States’ budgets."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: EU economies face a structural need for seasonal work for which labour from within the EU is expected to become less and less available. As regards future skills shortages, traditional sectors will continue to play an important role and the structural need for low-skilled and low-qualified workers is likely to continue expanding. It should also be pointed out that there is a more permanent need for unskilled labour within the EU. It is expected to be increasingly difficult to fill these gaps with EU national workers, primarily owing to the fact that these workers consider seasonal work unattractive. Further, there is significant evidence that certain third-country seasonal workers face exploitation and sub-standard working conditions which may threaten their health and safety. Lastly, sectors of the economy that are characterised by a strong presence of seasonal workers - most notably agriculture, horticulture and tourism - are repeatedly identified as the sectors most prone to work undertaken by third-country nationals who are staying illegally. The proposal is part of a comprehensive package of measures, proposed in the Policy Plan on Legal Migration of 2005 and further endorsed by the Stockholm Programme, adopted by the European Council in December 2009. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the following options were considered: Option 1 - Status quo. Current developments in Member States and at EU level would continue within the existing legal framework. Employers will be under certain obligations resulting from the 2009 Directive on employer sanctions as regards notifications to authorities and penalties in the case of illegal employment. The effect of this option would be limited. Option 2 - Directive on entry and residence conditions of seasonal workers and rights . Common rules would be established, including the definition of seasonal work, and admission criteria. This would help to establish a common legal framework applicable to all employers in the EU and to prevent exploitation. However, seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex procedures for entry. Option 3 - Directive laying down common admission procedures . In addition to option 2, a single work and residence permit for third-country seasonal workers would be introduced, to be issued in a single procedure. Provisions would be made for facilitating re-entry of a seasonal worker in subsequent seasons. Hiring procedures would be more efficient, and a more predictable workforce would be available for EU employers. Option 4 - Directive on measures to ensure effective return . Measures would include limitation of the length of stay, and an explicit obligation to return at the end of the period. Overstaying of seasonal workers would be prevented to some extent. Effects on the functioning of the EU labour market would be marginal. Seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex entry procedures. Option 5 - Communication, coordination and cooperation among Member States . No new legislation would be introduced, but complementary and supporting activities would be undertaken with a view to approximating Member States’ practices. Effects would be limited, as the measures would not be binding; potential seasonal workers and their prospective employers would continue to face an array of different rules for admission and different rights would be granted to seasonal workers during their residence. The preferred option is a combination of options 2, 3 and 4. Common admission standards with simplified entry procedures and the prospect of returning in a subsequent season (options 2 and 3) will provide for flexible admission to endow the EU labour market with the necessary resources. Elements from option 4 should help ensure the return of the seasonal worker and thus prevent overstaying. LEGAL BASE: Article 79(2)(a) and (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal establishes a fast-track procedure for the admission of third-country seasonal workers, based on a common definition and common criteria, in particular the existence of a work contract or a binding job offer that specifies a salary equal to or above a minimum level. Seasonal workers will be issued with a residence permit allowing them to work for a specified maximum period per calendar year. Provision is also made for facilitating the re-entry of a seasonal worker in a subsequent season. In order to prevent exploitation and protect the safety and health of third-country seasonal workers, legal provisions applying to working conditions are clearly defined. Also, employers are required to provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have appropriate accommodation during his/her stay and that provision is made for facilitation of complaints. To prevent overstaying of third-country seasonal workers, a maximum duration of stay per calendar year is laid down as well as the explicit obligation to return after that period; there is no possibility of status change. The main provisions are as follows: Chapter I: General provisions Purpose :the purpose of the proposal is to introduce a special procedure for the entry and residence of third-country nationals applying to reside in the EU for seasonal employment, and to define the rights of seasonal workers. Scope : the provisions only apply to third-country nationals who reside outside the territory of the Member States. There is no provision for applications for employment as seasonal workers from within a Member State. The proposal does not apply to third-country nationals posted by undertakings established in a Member State in the framework of a provision of services in accordance with Directive 96/71/EC. Definitions : the notion of seasonal work is distinguished from regular, permanent work in particular by higher workforce requirements linked to an event or pattern of events, such as the planting or harvesting period in agriculture, or the holiday period in tourism including events, festivals, biennales or long term exhibitions in culture. Member States may determine specific sectors of the economy that meet the criteria for seasonal work. More favourable provisions : the proposal allows Member States to grant more favourable conditions only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern the procedural safeguards, the level of rights granted to seasonal workers, as well as provisions relating to accommodation and facilitation of complaints. Chapter II: Admission criteria Criteria for admission : the proposal sets out the criteria that a third-country national seasonal worker and his/her employer must fulfil. As the admission is demand-driven, a work contract or a binding job offer must be presented. They should specify a level of remuneration in order to allow the competent authorities to assess whether the proposed remuneration is comparable to that paid for the respective activity in the Member State concerned. This is vital in order to avoid an unfair advantage for the employer and exploitative working conditions for the seasonal worker. The work contract must also specify the working hours per week or month. ensure that employers only request third-country seasonal workers in case of real economic need (sufficient employment capacities); serve as a guarantee of a certain, fixed level of remuneration for the seasonal workers, and, when applicable, other relevant working conditions such as insurances; enable efficient control by the competent authorities before admission. The application must also include evidence that the respective seasonal worker will benefit from appropriate accommodation. Grounds for refusal : the proposal does not create a right to admission. These provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusal as well as for withdrawal and non-renewal, including non-fulfilment of the admission criteria, the existence of quotas and the possibility for Member States to carry out a labour market test. The principle of EU preference, as expressed in the relevant provisions of the Acts of Accession of 2003 and 2005, constitutes EU primary law, and therefore the Directive must be applied in conformity with the Acts of Accession by those Member States that still make use of the transitional arrangements. Chapter III: Procedure and permit Access to information : Member States are required to ensure that the relevant information about conditions of entry and residence, including the rights granted to third-country seasonal workers, and about all the documentary evidence necessary for lodging the application are available to prospective third-country seasonal workers and their employers. Applications : Member States have to determine whether applications are to be lodged by the third-country national or by his or her prospective employer. They are also required to designate a competent authority to receive the application and issue the permit. This designation is without prejudice to the role and responsibilities of other national authorities with regard to the examination of and decision on the application. Furthermore, the designation to receive and issue the permit should not prevent Member States from appointing other authorities with which the third-country national or his/her prospective employer can lodge the application (e.g. consular offices) and which have the authority to issue the permit. The application to reside and work as a seasonal worker must be submitted in a single application procedure. Seasonal worker permit : third-country nationals for whom a positive decision has been taken by the Member State concerned must receive a seasonal worker permit. The residence permit with the indication ‘seasonal worker’ must allow both the residence and the exercise of the specific seasonal work authorised, without an additional permit, in particular a work permit, being necessary. Accordingly, for periods of stay below three months, Member States must issue a visa that will also entitle the seasonal worker to exercise the specific employment activity for which he/she was admitted. Duration of stay : the maximum period of stay is set at six months in any calendar year. Such strict limitation of the duration of stay should contribute to ensuring that third-country national workers admitted under the Directive are actually employed for work that is genuinely seasonal and not for regular work. Explicit provision is made that within the maximum duration of stay an extension of the contract or a change of employer for seasonal work is possible. This is important because seasonal workers who are tied to a single employer may face the risk of abuse. Also, the possibility of extending the stay within the specified period of time may reduce the risk of overstaying. Facilitation of re-entry : this provision is intended to promote circular migration of third-country national seasonal workers, that is, their movement between a third country and the EU for temporary stay and work in the latter. This kind of migration will potentially benefit the country of origin, the EU host country and the seasonal worker him/herself. Accordingly, Member States have the choice of either issuing multi-seasonal permits or applying a facilitated procedure. Multi-seasonal permits cover up to three seasons and are thus appropriate for sectors where the labour market needs remain stable over a period of time. A third-country national who did not comply with the obligations linked to a previous stay as a seasonal worker is to be excluded from admission as a seasonal worker for one or more years. Sanctions : an employer who has not fulfilled obligations resulting from the work contract must be subjected to sanctions and excluded from the possibility to apply for seasonal workers for at least one year. Procedure : a fast-track procedure (30 days) is provided for examining applications. Procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decision. Accommodation: employers of seasonal workers must provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have accommodation ensuring an adequate standard of living. This covers cases where the employer is to provide accommodation and where accommodation is to be provided by a third party. Chapter IV: Rights Rights : a seasonal worker permit entitles its holder to enter and reside on the territory of the Member State which has issued the permit and to exercise the employment activity authorised by the permit. The text defines the working conditions, including pay, dismissal and health and safety requirements at the workplace applicable to seasonal workers in order to ensure legal certainty. It also grants rights to third-country seasonal workers by determining fields where equal treatment with own nationals should be ensured in the form of a minimum requirement without prejudice to the right of Member States to adopt or maintain provisions which are more favourable. Accordingly, equal treatment applies in respect of freedom of association and affiliation and membership of an organisation representing workers. Equal treatment : equal treatment also applies to social security and covers the benefits defined in Regulation (EC) No 883/04 on the coordination of social security systems. Such provisions are intended to establish common rules within the EU; to recognise that third-country national seasonal workers legally working in a Member State contribute to the European economy through their tax payments; and to serve as a safeguard to reduce unfair competition between own nationals and third-country nationals that may result from possible exploitation of the latter. Complaints: complaints mechanisms should be put in place, open not only to third-country seasonal workers, but also to designated third parties. Evidence suggests that seasonal workers are often either not aware of the existence of such mechanisms or they are hesitant to use them in their own name, as they are afraid of the consequences in terms of future employment possibilities. Chapter V: Final provisions : this chapter regulates the obligations of Member States concerning sharing the relevant statistical data and the information resulting from transposition of the Directive.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union has been a Contracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (the ICCAT Convention) since 14 November 1997, following the adoption of Council Decision 86/238/EEC. The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation in the conservation and management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas through the establishment of an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the adoption by the latter of conservation and management measures which become binding on the contracting parties. In 1998, ICCAT adopted resolution 98-18 concerning the unreported and unregulated catches of tuna by large-scale longline vessels in the Convention area. Following the adoption of resolution 98-18, ICCAT identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels. As a consequence, ICCAT recommended that Contracting Parties take appropriate measures, consistent with provisions of the 1998 Resolution, to the effect that the import of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products in any form from the above mentioned countries be prohibited. As a consequence, imports to the Union of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating from these countries were prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 827/2004. In 2004, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations for the lifting of trade-restrictive measures against those three countries. As a consequence, Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 was amended by Regulation (EC) No 919/2005, so that it continued prohibiting such imports only from Bolivia and Georgia. At its 22nd regular annual meeting, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made and actions taken by Bolivia and Georgia and adopted recommendation 11-19 lifting the import prohibitions on Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products which had been imposed on those two countries. Regulation (EC) No 827/2004, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 919/2005 should therefore be repealed. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the lifting of the import prohibitions on Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products that were imposed on Bolivia and Georgia has been adopted by ICCAT, international body to which the European Union is a Contracting Party. In order to uphold its international commitments, the European Union should enact such decision into Union law and therefore repeal Regulation (EC) No 827/2004. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), on the one hand, and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts), on the other. In the context of the alignment of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 to the new rules of the TFEU, powers currently conferred to the Commission by that Regulation have been reclassified into measures of delegated nature and measures of implementing nature. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to: identify the delegated powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and to establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts; adapt certain provisions to the decision-making procedures of the TFEU. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 94/9/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The proposal does not change the scope of Directive and the essential health and safety requirements. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the products are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the products bear the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 94/9/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 94/9/EC on the placing on the market of products has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their products comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant article is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The changes made to the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC concern: the definitions, the obligations of economic operators, the presumption of conformity provided by harmonised standards, the declaration of conformity, CE marking, the safeguard clause procedure and the conformity assessment procedures. The proposal does not change the scope and the safety objectives of Directive 2006/95. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the materials are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the electrical equipment bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2006/95/EC on the placing on the market of electrical equipment has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their electrical material complies with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when non-compliant electrical equipment is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Regulation (EC) N° 261/2004 and Regulation (EC) N° 2027/97). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 on air carrier liability in respect of the carriage of passengers and their baggage by air have significantly contributed to protecting the rights of air passengers when their travel plans are disrupted by denied boarding, long delays, cancellations or mishandled baggage. A number of shortcomings revealed during the implementation of the rights under the Regulations have, however, prevented their full potential in terms of passenger protection from being realised. In order to ensure a more effective, efficient and consistent application of air passenger rights across the Union, a series of adjustments to the current legal framework is required. This was underlined in the Commission’s 2010 EU Citizenship Report on dismantling obstacles to EU citizens' rights, which announced measures to ensure a set of common rights, notably for air passengers, and the adequate enforcement of these rights. In its resolution of 29 March 2012, the European Parliament considered that proper application of the existing rules by Member States and air carriers, enforcement of sufficient means of redress and providing passengers with accurate information concerning their rights should be the cornerstones of regaining passengers’ trust. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission evaluated four options: Option 1 : focus on economic incentives (moderate change of enforcement); Option 2 : balance stronger enforcement policy with economic incentives: ·  Variant 2a : increasing the time threshold after which the passenger has a right to compensation in case of delays from the current three hours to at least five; ·  Variant 2b : extending the scope of ""extraordinary circumstances"" to include most technical defaults; Option 3 : focus on stronger enforcement and clarify passenger rights; Option 4 : centralised enforcement. The impact assessment concludes that option 2 is preferable to the others, as it would most effectively and efficiently enhance passengers' rights while taking into account the financial impact on the air transport sector. Variant 2a is slightly preferred to 2b. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to promote the interest of air passengers by ensuring that air carriers comply with a high level of air passenger protection during travel disruptions, while taking into account the financial implications for the air transport sector and ensuring that air carriers operate under harmonised conditions in a liberalised market. In concrete terms, the proposal: ·  clarifies the definition of ""extraordinary circumstances in line with the European Court's decision in the case C-549/07 (Wallentin-Herman) i.e. circumstances which, by their nature or origin, are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned and are beyond its actual control; ·  increases the time threshold after which the right to compensation arises from three to five hours for all journeys within the EU. For journeys to/from third countries, the threshold will be dependent upon the distance of the journey: (i) 5 hours for outside-EU journeys of 3500 km or less; (ii) 9 hours for outside–EU journeys between 3500 and 6000 km, and (iii) 12 hours for outside-EU journeys of 6000 km and more; ·  stipulates that if the air carrier cannot reroute the passenger on its own services within 12 hours, it must consider other carriers or other transport modes, subject to seat availability; ·  introduces a single time threshold for care of 2 hours for flights of all distances; ·  confirms that passengers that miss a flight connection because their previous flight was delayed have a right to care and, under certain circumstances, a right to compensation. However, such right would only apply where the connecting flights are part of a single contract of carriage; ·  confirms that passengers of flights rescheduled with a notice of period of less than two weeks in advance of the originally scheduled time have similar rights to delayed passengers; ·  clearly sets out the rights of passengers when their aircraft is delayed on the tarmac, in particular a right to disembark after five hours; ·  provides that passengers should have a right to information about the flight disruption as soon as the information is available; ·  clarifies the role of the National Enforcement Bodies (NEBs), and extends their role to the monitoring of compliance with the baggage provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2027/97, and also enhances the exchange of information and the coordination between the NEBs, and between the NEBs and the Commission; ·  requires air carriers to inform passengers, at the time of reservation, about their claim and complaint handling procedures, and provide electronic means to submit complaints. Airlines will be required to respond to passengers within two months. Lastly, the proposal ensures better enforcement of passenger rights with regard to mishandled baggage: (i) passengers with reduced mobility should have the same right to free movement, and non-discrimination as other citizens; (ii) increased liability of air carriers with regard to mobility equipment up to the actual value of the equipment; (iii) enhanced transparency with regard to baggage allowances; (iv) measures with regard to musical instruments; (v) require air carriers to issue a claim form at the airport where passengers can complain about delayed, damaged or lost baggage BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 established a European framework for cross-border insolvency proceedings. It determines which Member State has jurisdiction for opening insolvency proceedings, establishes uniform rules on applicable law and provides for the recognition and enforcement of insolvency-related decisions as well as for the coordination of main and secondary insolvency proceedings. Adopted in May 2000, the Insolvency Regulation has applied since 31 May 2002. Ten years after its entry into force, the Commission's December 2012 report on the application of the Regulation concludes that the Regulation is functioning well in general but that it is desirable to improve the application of certain of its provisions. The evaluation of the Insolvency Regulation identified five main shortcomings: the Regulation's scope does not cover national procedures which provide for the restructuring of a company at a pre-insolvency stage (“pre-insolvency proceedings”) or proceedings which leave the existing management in place (“hybrid proceedings”); there are difficulties in determining which Member State is competent to open insolvency proceedings; problems have also been identified with respect to secondary proceedings; there are problems relating to the rules on publicity of insolvency proceedings and the lodging of claims; the Regulation does not contain specific rules dealing with the insolvency of a multi-national enterprise group although a large number of cross-border insolvencies involve groups of companies. According to the Commission, the revision of the Regulation will contribute to ensuring a smooth development and the survival of businesses, as stated in the Small Business Act . The revision is also one of the key actions listed in the Single Market Act II . IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed the costs and benefits of the main aspects of the proposed reform in its Impact Assessment which accompanies this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main elements of the proposed reform of the Insolvency Regulation may be summarised as follows: Scope : the proposal extends the scope of the Regulation by revising the definition of insolvency proceedings to include hybrid and pre-insolvency proceedings, as well as debt discharge proceedings and other insolvency proceedings for natural persons which currently do not fit the definition. It is proposed to: amend the current definition of ""insolvency proceedings"" to open the scope to proceedings which do not involve a liquidator but in which the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a court; make an express reference to proceedings for the adjustment of debts and to the purpose of rescue in order to include also those proceedings which enable the debtor to find an arrangement with his creditors at a preinsolvency stage. Jurisdiction : the proposal clarifies the jurisdiction rules and improves the procedural framework for determining jurisdiction. The proposal retains the concept of the centre of main interest (COMI) but complements the definition of it. It also introduces a provision determining the COMI of natural persons. In addition, a new recital clarifies the circumstances in which the presumption that the COMI of a legal person is located at the place of its registered office can be rebutted. Furthermore, the proposal grants all foreign creditors a right to challenge the opening decision and ensures that these creditors are informed of the opening decision in order to be able to effectively exercise their rights. Secondary proceedings : several modifications are proposed with the aim of improving the efficient administration of the debtor's estate in situations where the debtor has an establishment in another Member State . The proposal provides for a more efficient administration of insolvency proceedings by: enabling the court to refuse the opening of secondary proceedings if this is not necessary to protect the interests of local creditors, abolishing the requirement that secondary proceedings must be winding-up proceedings and improving the cooperation between main and secondary proceedings, in particular by extending the cooperation requirements to the courts involved. Publicity of insolvency proceedings and lodging of claims : the proposal requires Member States to publish the relevant court decisions in cross-border insolvency cases in a publicly accessible electronic register and provides for the interconnection of national insolvency registers. The proposal facilitates the lodging of claims for foreign creditors, particularly small creditors and SMEs, in three ways: (i) it introduces standard forms for the lodging of claims which will be available in all official languages of the European Union; (ii) it gives foreign creditors at least 45 days following publication of the notice of opening of proceedings in the insolvency register to lodge their claims; (iii) legal representation will not be mandatory for lodging a claim in a foreign jurisdiction, thereby reducing costs for creditors. Groups of companies : the proposal creates a specific legal framework to deal with the insolvency of members of a group of companies while maintaining the entity-by-entity approach which underlies the current Insolvency Regulation. introduces an obligation to coordinate insolvency proceedings relating to different members of the same group of companies by obliging the liquidators and the courts involved to cooperate with each other in a similar way as this is proposed in the context of main and secondary proceedings; gives each liquidator standing in the proceedings concerning another member of the same group. In particular, the liquidator has a right to be heard in these other proceedings, to request a stay of the other proceedings and to propose a reorganisation plan in a way which would enable the respective creditors' committee or court to take a decision on it. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal would have limited impact on the EU budget. The IT application for the interconnection of the insolvency registers has already been developed and will be hosted on the e-Justice Portal. The implication for the EU budget over 2014-2020 will comprise only of hosting and maintenance costs of the IT application. In total, these costs would amount to EUR 1 500 000 for the period 2014-2020 and would be covered by the financial envelope of the future Justice programme . DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the context of the ongoing economic and financial crisis, the smooth implementation of the European Fisheries Fund programmes is of particular importance for investment in the fisheries sector. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under an adjustment programme. In order to facilitate the management of Union funding, to help accelerate investments and to improve the availability of funding to the economy, Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 was amended in 2012 to allow the increase of interim and final payments from the European Fisheries Fund by an amount corresponding to ten percentage points above the actual co-financing rate for each priority axis for Member States which are facing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and request to benefit from that measure. Article 77a of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 allows for the application of that increased co-financing rate up to 31 December 2013. However, since Member States still face serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, the application of the increased co-financing rate should not be limited to the end of 2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to top up payments to programme countries until the end of the 2007-2013 period. The increase will be an amount calculated by applying ten percentage points top-up to the co-financing rates applicable to the priority axes of the programmes to the newly certified expenditure submitted during the period in question until the ceiling for payments is reached. The total financial allocation for the period from the Fund to the countries and the programmes in question will not change. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed to modify article 77a of the Regulation to allow the Commission to continue, until the end of the eligibility period of the 2007-2013 operational programmes, to reimburse the newly declared expenditure by an increased amount calculated by applying a 10 percentage points top-up of the applicable co-financing rates for the priority axis. The contribution from the fund to the priority axis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned in the Commission decision approving the operational programme. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: There is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of the Fund financing provided for in the operational programmes for the 2007-2013 programming period. For payment appropriations, the proposal relating to the top-up is budget neutral."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: while emissions from other sectors are generally falling, road transport is one of the few sectors where emissions have risen rapidly. Between 1990 and 2008 emissions from road transport increased by 26%. As a result, it is the second biggest source of GHG emissions in the EU, and contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of CO2. In March 2011 the Commission adopted the 'Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system'. It sets out a transport strategy within a frame of achieving a 60% reduction in transport GHG emissions by 2050. Regulation (EC) 443/2009 sets the CO2 reduction framework for the new car fleet to 2020. It provides an operation in two parts. In the first period to 2015 the modalities of compliance with the target have been established. For the second period to 2020 the target cannot become effective without implementing the necessary modalities, which are to be determined in a review. This target was established in the co-decision process and is not reconsidered in the review. Failure to determine or implement the modalities would have a detrimental effect on vehicle manufacturers and parts suppliers who need certainty with regard to the technology and vehicles that will be needed to meet the target. Key modalities in the current Regulation include the limit value curve which is defined by the utility parameter and the function describing the relationship between the utility parameter and CO2 emissions (setting the shape and slope). Other modalities include the excess emissions premium scheme, eco-innovations, derogations, pooling, the phasing-in of the targets and granting of super-credits for a limited period of time. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a joint impact assessment supporting the current proposal and a proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 510/2011  has been prepared. The following aspects were analysed: (a) 'do nothing' option; (b) modalities of meeting the car target; (c) simplification and reduction of administrative burden; (d) adaptation to the new test cycle; (e) form and stringency of legislation beyond 2020. Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends the Regulation to implement the modalities of meeting the 95 gCO2/km target for new passenger cars to be reached in 2020. The main modalities implemented are as follows: · the utility parameter continues to be the vehicle's mass in running order; · the limit value curve remains linear with a slope of 60% compared to the baseline fleet which is kept as the 2006 fleet in line with the 2015 limit value curve; · super-credits for cars emitting below 35 gCO2/km are introduced between 2020 and 2023 with a multiplier of 1.3 and limited to a cumulative figure of 20 000 vehicles per manufacturers over the duration of the scheme; · the ""niche"" derogation for manufacturers target is updated for 2020; · manufacturers responsible for less than 500 registrations of new passenger cars per year are excluded from the obligation of having a CO2 target; · more flexibility is allowed in the timing of decisions granting small volume derogations; · eco-innovations are retained when a revised test procedure is implemented; · the Excess Emissions Premium is maintained at €95 per g/km per vehicle; · the Committee procedure provisions are updated to be compatible with the Lisbon Treaty. As industry benefits from indications of the regulatory regime that would apply beyond 2020, the proposal includes a further review to take place by 31 December 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Council Regulation No (EC) 207/2009). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an increasingly competitive environment, the growing number of trade mark applications at both national and EU levels, and the growing number of trade mark users demonstrates the crucial role of trade marks in terms of market success and commercial value. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date. In its ‘ Small Business Act ’ of 2008, the Commission pledged to make the Community trademark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, in its 2008 Communication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe the Commission underlined its commitment to effective and efficient trademark protection and to a trademark system of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trademark system in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) and National Offices. Lastly, in its 2011 Intellectual Property Rights Strategy for Europe, the Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a view to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it more effective, efficient and consistent overall. The Council has also called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identified one main problem that the revised Regulation needs to address: the low level of cooperation among trade mark offices in Europe. The following options were considered to solve the problems and to achieve three corresponding objectives. ·  Providing an adequate legal basis for cooperation: Option 1: no specific legal basis; Option 2: legal basis allowing optional cooperation; Option 3: legal basis obliging mandatory cooperation. ·  Technical capacity building at National Offices : Option 1: each office to procure and develop the required facilities and tools; Option 2: optional access to tools; Option 3: mandatory access to tools. ·  Securing long-term financing for cooperation activities : Option 1: from Member States; Option 2: from EU budget; Option 3: from OHIM budget. The impact assessment concluded that option 3 (legal basis obliging mandatory cooperation, mandatory access to tools, and financing from OHIM budget) would in all cases be proportionate and best suited to achieving the objectives pursued. LEGAL BASIS: Article 118 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main common objective of this initiative and of the parallel proposal for the recast of Directive 2008/95/EC is to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and efficient in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and legal security. As regards this proposal to revise the Regulation, the Commission is not proposing a new system, but well-targeted modernisation of existing provisions, with the main aims being: 1) Adapting the terminology in the Regulation to the Lisbon Treaty and adapting provisions to the Common Approach on decentralised agencies : throughout the Regulation, the term ‘Community trade mark’ is replaced by ‘European trade mark’. The term “Office”, insofar as it refers to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, is replaced by the term ‘Agency’. 2) Streamlining procedures to apply for and register a European trade mark: ·  since National Offices hardly ever receive applications for European trade marks any more, the option for filing these at National Offices should be abolished; ·  with regard to the filing date, it is proposed to abolish the one-month period and to link the ‘obligation’ to pay with the filing of the application, so that applicants will have to provide evidence that they submitted or authorised their payment when they filed their application; ·  current search regimes are abolished, in view of the fact that they do not provide a reliable trade mark clearance tool; ·  the current one-month period between the Agency notifying the applicant of search reports and publication of the application is abolished, which will speed up the registration procedure. 3) Increasing legal certainty by clarifying provisions and removing ambiguities: ·  the proposed new definition of a European trademark leaves the door open to registering matter that can be represented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees; ·  the absolute grounds for refusal are fully aligned with the EU law on geographical indications; ·  it is clarified that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier rights; ·  in cases of both double identity and similarity, it is only the origin function which matters; ·  in accordance with the rulings of the Court of Justice, it is appropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met; ·  the trade mark owner may prevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC; ·  it is clarified that goods may not be imported into the EU even if only the consignor is acting for commercial purposes. ·  bearing in mind the outcome of the Philips/Nokia judgment, the proposal entitles right holders to stop third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing an unauthorised trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the Union, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation; Other amendments concern the following provisions: limitation of the effects of a European trademark; designation and classification of goods and services; European certification marks, and tasks of the Agency, which are defined in one new Article. 4) Establishing an appropriate framework for cooperation between OHIM and national offices to promote convergence of practices and developing common tools: the proposal contains provisions for mandatory cooperation between the Agency and Member States, and stipulates the main areas for cooperation and specific common projects of Union interest which the Agency will coordinate. It further sets up a funding mechanism enabling the Agency to finance those common projects by means of grants. 5) Aligning the framework to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directive 2008/95/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an increasingly competitive environment, the growing number of trade mark applications at both national and EU levels, and the growing number of trade mark users demonstrates the crucial role of trade marks in terms of market success and commercial value. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date. In its ‘ Small Business Act ’ of 2008, the Commission pledged to make the Community trademark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, in its 2008 Communication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe the Commission underlined its commitment to effective and efficient trademark protection and to a trademark system of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trademark system in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) and National Offices. Lastly, in its 2011 Intellectual Property Rights Strategy for Europe, the Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a view to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it more effective, efficient and consistent overall. The Council has also called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment carried out for both the review of the Regulation and of the Directive identified two main problems: (i) the divergent provisions of the existing regulatory framework, and (ii) the low level of cooperation between trade mark offices in the Union. Four options were envisaged. ·  Option 1 : no further approximation of trade mark laws and procedures; ·  Option 2 : Partial expansion of the approximation of national laws and their consistency with the Community trade mark system; ·  Option 3 : full approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures; ·  Option 4 : a single trademark rulebook, which would replace Member States' trade mark laws in their entirety, by setting uniform rules across the Union. The impact assessment concluded that option 2 would be proportionate and would best serve to achieve the objectives pursued. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the main common objective of this proposal for recasting and of the parallel proposal for the amendment of the Regulation is to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and efficient for businesses in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and legal security. Specifically, the initiative to recast the Directive is driven by the following objectives: 1) Modernising and improving the existing provisions of the Directive. This will be achieved by amending outdated provisions, increasing legal certainty and clarifying trade mark rights in terms of their scope and limitations: ·  the proposed new definition does not restrict the permissible means of representation to graphic or visual representation but leaves the door open to register matter that can be represented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees; ·  the proposal makes it clear that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier rights; ·  it is clarified that in cases of both double identity and similarity, it is only the origin function which matters; ·  in accordance with the rulings of the Court of Justice, it is appropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met; ·  the trade mark owner may prevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC; ·  it is made clear that the importing of goods into the Union is also prohibited where it is only the consignor who acts for commercial purposes; ·  bearing in mind the outcome of the Philips/Nokia judgment, the proposal entitles right holders to stop third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing an unauthorised trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the Union, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation; ·  there are provisions allowing proceedings against the distribution and sale of labels and packaging and similar items which may subsequently be combined with illicit products. 2) Achieve greater approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures with the aim of making them more consistent with the Community trade mark system, by (a) adding further substantive rules and (b) introducing principal procedural rules into the Directive in accordance with provisions contained in the Regulation. In this regard, it is proposed, inter alia: ·  to insert provisions relating to geographical indications, traditional terms for wine and traditional specialities guaranteed in the Directive; ·  to ensure that, in all Member States, national trade marks with reputation enjoy the same level of protection as that afforded to Community trade marks; ·  to complement the Directive with a corresponding body of rules addressing trade marks as objects of property as contained in the Regulation; ·  to provide for a set of specific provisions for the registration and protection of collective marks. 3) Facilitate cooperation between the offices of the Member States and OHIM for the purpose of promoting convergence of practices and the development of common tools, by putting in place a legal basis for this cooperation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: at global level, according to United Nations estimates, the total amount of criminal proceeds in 2009 was approximately USD 2.1 trillion, or 3.6% of global GDP. There are no reliable estimates of the size of criminal profits in the European Union, but in Italy the proceeds of organised crime laundered in 2011 have been estimated by the Bank of Italy at EUR 150 billion. The profits derived from these activities are laundered and reinvested into licit activities . Organised crime groups increasingly hide and reinvest assets in Member States other than the one where the crime is committed which weakens our ability to fight cross-border serious and organised crime in the EU as a whole. All Member States should therefore have in place an efficient system to freeze, manage and confiscate criminal assets because, although regulated by EU and national laws, the confiscation of criminal assets remains underdeveloped and underutilised. As an effective tool in the fight against organised and serious crime, confiscation of criminal assets has been given strategic priority at EU level. The 2009 Stockholm Programme calls the Member States and the Commission to make the confiscation of criminal assets more efficient and to strengthen the cooperation between Asset Recovery Offices. In a series of conclusion, the Council has also called on the Commission to consider strengthening the legal framework in order to achieve more effective regimes for third party confiscation and extended confiscation. For its part, the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on organised crime which invites the Commission to present new legislative proposals in the field. It is in this context that the Commission put forward “An Internal Security Strategy in Action” in which it undertook to propose legislation to strengthen the EU legal framework on confiscation, in particular to allow more third-party confiscation and extended confiscation, and to facilitate mutual recognition of non-conviction-based confiscation orders between Member States. Over time, all confiscation and freezing orders issued by a Member State should be effectively enforced against assets located in another Member State. It should be noted that the majority of definitions and certain basic provisions in this proposal for a directive may be found in existing European texts, and in particular: Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA , which obliges Member States to enable confiscation, to allow value confiscation where the direct proceeds of crime cannot be seized and to ensure that requests from other Member States are treated with the same priority as domestic proceedings; Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA , which harmonises confiscation laws; Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA , which provides for mutual recognition of freezing orders; Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA , which provides for the mutual recognition of confiscation orders; and Council Decision 2007/845/JHA on cooperation between national Asset Recovery Offices. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of several policy alternatives that represent differing degrees of EU-level intervention. Option 0: a non-legislative option, Option 1: a minimal legislative option (correcting deficiencies in the existing EU legal framework which inhibit it from functioning as intended) and Option 2: a maximal legislative option (going beyond the aims of the existing EU legal framework). Within the latter, two maximal legislative sub-options are analysed, one with and one without EU level action relating to mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders between Member States. The preferred policy option is the maximal legislative option. This option would considerably enhance the harmonisation of national rules on confiscation and enforcement, inter alia by amending existing provisions on extended confiscation, and introducing new provisions on non-conviction based confiscation and third party confiscation and introducing more effective rules on the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(2) and Article 83 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal for a Directive lays down minimum on the freezing of property with a view to possible later confiscation and on the confiscation of property in criminal matters. The Directive only makes provision for minimum rules (national legislative measures may be more ambitious). The adoption of those minimum rules will further harmonise the Member States' freezing and confiscation regimes, and thus facilitate mutual trust and effective cross-border cooperation. Confiscation : based on the existing provision of the Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA, the proposal provides for the Member States to enable the confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime following a final conviction and to enable the confiscation of property of equivalent value to the proceeds of crime. Extended powers of confiscation : according to the proposal “extended confiscation signifies the ability to confiscate assets which go beyond the direct proceeds of a crime. A criminal conviction may be followed by the (extended) confiscation not only of assets associated with the specific crime, but of additional assets which the court determines are the proceeds of other similar crimes. Extended confiscation powers are already provided for in the EU legislation. Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA obliges Member States to allow the confiscation of assets belonging directly or indirectly to persons convicted of certain serious crimes (related to organised crime and terrorism activities). However, this Framework Decision establishes alternative minimum set of rules for extended confiscation, leaving Member States free to apply one, two or all three options. This proposal introduces extended confiscation for the crimes listed in Article 83(1) TFEU as set out in existing Union legislation. It also streamlines the existing regime of alternative options for extended confiscation, by providing for a single minimum standard. Extended confiscation can take place where a court finds, based on specific facts, that a person convicted of an offence covered by this Directive is in possession of assets which are substantially more probable to be derived from other criminal activities of similar nature or gravity than from any other activities. Extended confiscation is excluded where the similar criminal activities could not be the subject of criminal proceedings due to prescription under national criminal law. The proposal also excludes from confiscation the proceeds of alleged criminal activities for which the affected person has been finally acquitted in a previous trial or other situations where where the ne bis in idem principle applies. Non-conviction based confiscation: this provision introduces provisions on non-conviction based confiscation in limited circumstances, with a view to addressing cases where criminal prosecution cannot be exercised. It accordingly concerns confiscation in relation to a criminal offence, but it allows Member States to choose whether confiscation should be imposed by criminal and/or civil/administrative courts. Non-conviction based procedures allow to freeze and confiscate an asset without a prior conviction of its owner in a criminal court. In order to meet the requirement of proportionality, the proposal would not introduce non-conviction based confiscation in all cases, but makes it possible only in circumstances where a criminal conviction cannot be obtained because the suspect has died, is permanently ill or when his flight or illness prevents effective prosecution within a reasonable time and poses the risk that it could be barred by statutory limitations. Third party confiscation : criminals often transfer their assets to knowing third parties as soon as they come under investigation, in order to avoid confiscation. Third party confiscation involves the confiscation of assets that have been transferred by an investigated or convicted person to third parties. The Member States' national provisions on third party confiscation are diverging. This hampers the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders on assets transferred to a third party. In order to meet the requirements of proportionality and protect the position of a third party acquiring property in good faith, the proposal does not introduce minimum harmonisation provisions on third party confiscation in all cases. This provision requires third party confiscation to be available for the proceeds of crime or other property of the defendant received for a price lower than market value and that a reasonable person in the position of the third party would suspect to be derived from crime or to be transferred in order to circumvent the application of confiscation measures. It clarifies that the reasonable-person-test must be based on concrete facts and circumstances to prevent arbitrary decisions. Moreover, third party confiscation should be possible only following an assessment, based on specific facts, that the confiscation of property of the convicted, suspected or accused person is unlikely to succeed, or in situations where unique objects must be restored to their rightful owner. Freezing : this provision requires Member States to enable the freezing of property or instrumentalities in danger of being dissipated, hidden or transferred out of the jurisdiction in view of possible later confiscation. It clarifies that such measures should be ordered by a court. The introduction of the possibility to use freezing powers in urgent cases in order to prevent asset dissipation in situations where waiting for an order issued by a court would jeopardize the possibilities of freezing is a longstanding priority concern of prosecutors and law enforcement agencies. The second paragraph of this Article requires Member States to have in place measures to ensure that assets in danger of being dissipated, hidden or transferred out of their jurisdiction can be frozen immediately by the competent authorities, prior to seeking a court order or pending its request. Safeguards : according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, fundamental rights such as the right to property are not absolute. They can legitimately be subject to restrictions provided these restrictions are provided for by law and are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others, as in the prevention of organised crime. Inasmuch as freezing or confiscation orders interfere with the right to property or other fundamental rights, they must be capable of challenge by affected parties under the conditions set by this Article. The existing EU legislation (e.g. Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA) provides that Member States should ensure that adequate legal remedies for the affected persons exist in national legislation. With a view to fully complying with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this Article introduces minimum safeguards at EU level. These aim at guaranteeing: the respect of the presumption of innocence , the right to a fair trial (including the ne bis in idem principle), the existence of effective judicial remedies before a court and the right to be informed on how to exercise such remedies. Determination of the extent of the confiscation and effective execution : persons suspected to belong to criminal organisations have proven to be successful in hiding their assets, often with the benefit of advice from skilled professionals. In case a confiscation order was issued, no property or insufficient property was discovered and the confiscation order could not be executed, this Article requires Member States to allow financial investigations on the person's assets to be pursued to the extent necessary to fully execute such order. This provision addresses the problem of the foreclosure of confiscation activities at the end of the criminal procedure and allows unexecuted or partially executed confiscation orders to apply against previously hidden assets which have ""resurfaced"" in the meantime. Management of frozen property : this provision intends to facilitate the management of property frozen in view of possible later confiscation. It requires Member States to introduce measures aimed at ensuring an adequate management of such property, notably by granting powers to realise frozen property, at least where it is liable to decline in value or become uneconomical to maintain. Effectiveness and reporting obligations : this provision introduces reporting obligations for Member States, which would help generate statistics to be used for evaluation purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal will imply no cost for the EU budget. It does not concern the budgetary allocation of the product of confiscation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directives 2005/71/EC and 2004/114/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union’s working age population has practically stopped growing and over the next couple of years it will start shrinking. The EU is also facing a situation of 'innovation emergency'. Europe is spending 0.8% of GDP less than the US and 1.5% less than Japan every year on Research & Development (R&D). in addition, thousands of the best researchers and innovators have moved to countries where conditions are more favorable. To counterbalance this lack of manpower, immigration from outside the EU is one source of highly skilled people, and third-country national students and researchers in particular are groups which are increasingly sought after and which the EU needs to actively attract. Allowing third-country nationals to acquire skills and knowledge through a period of training in Europe encourages “brain circulation” and supports cooperation with third countries. However, in the absence of a clear legal framework, there is also a risk of exploitation to which trainees and au-pairs are particularly exposed, with the subsequent risk of unfair competition on the labour market. With a view to better optimising those benefits and properly tackling those risks, and taking account of the similarities of the challenges faced by these categories of migrants, this proposal amends Council Directive 2004/114/EC (“Students’ Directive”) on the conditions of admission of third country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service: extending its scope to remunerated trainees and au-pairs and making mandatory provisions on unremunerated trainees that are currently discretionary, as well as Council Directive 2005/71/EC on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research (“Researchers’ Directive”). The proposal seeks to remedy the shortcomings highlighted in the implementation reports of the two Directives [see COM(2011)901 and 587] on the conditions of admissions in particular (visas, mobility aspects…) and procedural safeguards. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the following options were considered: Option 1 (baseline): the Member States would continue to apply different and diverging rules with respect to admission conditions (e.g. the granting of visas); Option 2: Increased communication efforts (in particular in case of researchers), and strengthened enforcement of the current rules; Option 3: Improvement of admission conditions, rights and procedural guarantees whereby Member States would be obliged to (i) grant the requisite visas to the third-country national (students and other categories) who has submitted an application and (ii) introduce a compulsory deadline for decisions on an application (60 days); (iii) provide for the right of students to work during their period of study for a minimum of 15 hours per week; Option 4: Further improvement of admission conditions, rights also on intra-EU mobility and procedural guarantees: (i) access to job-seeking following completion of studies or research project; (ii) extended scope to au-pairs and remunerated trainees; (iii) possibility to issue long-stay visas or residence permits; (iv) increased intra-EU mobility for researchers, students and remunerated trainees; (v) specific, more favorable rules applicable to beneficiaries of EU programmes (e.g. Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie); (vi) right of students to work for a minimum of 20 hours per week as of the first year of residence ; (vii) after finalization of their studies/research, students and researchers would be allowed to stay on the territory to identify work opportunities for a period of 12 months; (viii) decisions on applications within 60 days (all groups), and within 30 days for Erasmus Mundus and Marie Curie fellows. Option 4 appears to be the most cost-effective option to meet the key objectives and brings about positive economic and social impacts. The main disadvantage of legislative changes would be the costs involved: Member States would have to make modifications to their legislative frameworks. LEGAL BASIS: Article 79(2) points (a) and (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal’s overall objective is to support social, cultural and economic relationships between the EU and third countries, foster the transfer of skills and know-how and promote competitiveness while, at the same time, provide for safeguards ensuring fair treatment of these groups of third-country nationals. Chapter I – General provisions: the proposal has two specific objectives: to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals to the territory of the Member States for a period exceeding three months for the purposes of research, studies, pupil exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing; to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country national students and remunerated trainees in Member States other than the Member State which first grants the third-country national an authorisation. Scope: the proposal extends the scope of the “Student” Directive to include remunerated trainees and au-pairs. The proposal would not, however, apply to third-country nationals who are EU long-term residents given their more privileged status and their specific type of residence permit, or refugees, those residing in a Member State on a strictly temporary basis in accordance with Union legislation. Member States may grant more favourable conditions for the persons to whom the proposal for Directive applies, however only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern family members of researchers, rights to equal treatment, economic activities and procedural safeguards. Chapter II – Admission: General principle: an applicant who satisfies all the general and specific conditions for admission shall be granted a residence permit or a long-stay visa by the Member State where the application has been made. The proposal lays down the general conditions that applicants must fulfil in order to be admitted to a Member State, besides the specific conditions that apply to the different categories of third-country nationals laid down in the proposal. The general conditions are very much in line with those developed in the existing acquis on legal migration, and include valid documents, sickness insurance and minimum resources. Specific conditions: - the specific conditions of admission for researchers which already exist in the Researchers' Directive are maintained. The proposal lists the elements that should be contained in the hosting agreement: title and purpose of the research project, the confirmation of the organisation that it is hosting the researcher so that he or she can complete the research project, the start and end date of the research project, etc. For researchers to be aware of research organisations that can enter into hosting agreements, emphasis is placed in the proposal on the need for the list of approved organisation to be publicly available and up-dated regularly; - for students, the specific conditions are those in the “Students’ Directive”; - for pupils, remunerated and unremunerated trainees, volunteers and au-pairs, the specific conditions are that these persons are required to show evidence of the organisation that is responsible for their exchange, training or, volunteering. for au-pairs: in addition, there needs to be evidence that the host family accepts responsibility for example as far as subsistence and accommodation are concerned. The au-pair stay also needs to be based on an agreement between the au-pair and the host family defining his/her rights and obligations; for remunerated trainees, the training programme, its duration, conditions of supervision and working conditions need to be specified. In order to avoid situations in which trainees are used as 'cheap labour', the host entity may be obliged to declare that the third-country national is not filling a job. Chapter III – Authorisations and duration of residence: a series of provisions set out the information that should be included on the third-country national's residence permit or long-term visa. For researchers and students an authorisation should be granted for at least one year. For all other groups, the authorisation is limited to one year as a rule, with the possibility for exceptions. Chapter IV – Grounds for refusal, withdrawal or non-renewal of authorisations: the provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusing, withdrawing or not renewing an authorisation, such as the general and specific conditions for admission no longer being met, false documents etc., which are standard conditions under the existing migration Directives. Chapter V – Rights: to ensure the fair treatment of third-country nationals falling under the scope of the Directive, a new provision entitles them to equal treatment under the Single Permit Directive. More favourable rights to equal treatment with nationals of the host Member State as regards branches of social security as defined in Regulation No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security schemes are maintained for third-country national researchers, without the possibility for the limitations laid down by the Single Permit Directive. Furthermore, school pupils, volunteers, unremunerated trainees and au-pairs will benefit from equal treatment rights with nationals of the host Member State as regards access to goods and services and the supply of goods and services made available to the public independently on whether Union or national law gives them access to the labour market. Right to work: provisions exist in the proposal whereby researchers and students are given the right to work , with Member States being able to set certain limits. Researchers, as was the case under Directive 2005/71, are allowed to teach in accordance with national legislation. Regarding students, whereas under Directive 2004/114/EC students were allowed to work for a minimum of 10 hours per week, this period has been increased to 20 hours. With respect to students' access to economic activities, Member States may continue take into consideration their labour market situation but this should be done in a proportionate way in order not to systematically endanger the right to work. The proposal introduces the possibility for students and researchers, if they fulfil the general admission conditions of the proposal (except for the condition on being a minor), to stay in the Member State for 12 months upon finalisation of their studies/research in order to look for work or set up a business. This provision has the potential to make the Member States more competitive in the search for talents on a global stage. It would however not be an automatic work permit. In a period of more than 3 and less than 6 months, Member States could ask the third-country nationals to provide documentation that they are genuinely seeking for a job (for example, copies of the letters and CVs sent to employers) or are in the process of setting up a business. After 6 months, they could also ask third- country nationals to provide evidence that they have a genuine chance of being engaged or of launching a business. The proposal includes specific provisions on the admission and access to the labour market of researchers' family members in derogation to Directive 2003/86/EC with a view to increasing the EU’s attractiveness to third-country national researchers. Chapter VI – Mobility between Member States: a series of articles set out the conditions under which researchers, students and trainees can move between the Member States, in order to facilitate such mobility: for researchers , under Directive 2005/71/EC, the period for which they are allowed to move to a second Member State on the basis of the hosting agreement concluded in the first Member State has been extended from 3 to 6 months (N.B. in line with the provisions of the Blue Card Directive, researchers' family members can move between Member States together with the researcher). for students , provisions would also allow them to move to a second Member State for a period of up to 6 months on the basis of the authorisation granted by the first Member State . Specific rules apply to third country nationals who come under EU mobility programmes, for example the current Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie programmes, in order to simplify the exercise of mobility. Chapter VII – Procedure and transparency: the proposal introduces a time-limit that obliges Member States to decide on the complete application for an authorisation and notify the applicant in writing within 60 days (applying for all groups), and within 30 days for Union programmes including mobility measures. Procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decisions in writing, and ensuring respect for the right to a legal remedy. Provisions are also included in regard to communication: the Member States would be required to make information available on the entry and residence conditions as set by this proposal, including on approved research organisations and on fees. Taxes and fees: Member States may charge fees for the processing of applications. However, the amount of such fees should not endanger the fulfilment of the Directive's objectives. Chapter VIII - Final provisions: Member States would be required to establish national contact points to exchange information on third-country nationals covered by the proposal who move between Member States. Such national contact points already exist in relation to certain existing migration Directives such as the Blue Card Directive. Member States would be required to communicate to the Commission statistics on the numbers of third-country nationals granted authorisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the face of the increasing number and magnitude of humanitarian crises (natural catastrophes and man-made crises), the Union has to ensure adequate humanitarian aid. As envisaged in Article 214(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this proposal establishes the framework for the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, which should enable joint contributions from European volunteers in humanitarian aid operations. Its objective is to express the Union's humanitarian values and solidarity with people in need whether within or beyond the Union’s borders. Improving the mobilisation of the volunteering capacity of European citizens can also project a positive image of the Union in the world and foster interest for pan-European projects in support of humanitarian aid activities. The proposal builds on the 2010 Communication ""How to express EU citizens’ solidarity through volunteering: First reflections on a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps"". The Communication presents the guiding principles, gaps and necessary conditions to make a positive contribution to Union humanitarian aid. The Council and the European Parliament have expressed strong support for the initiative, reaffirming the key role of the Union in promoting volunteering and identifying some of the key components of the Corps. This proposal will, moreover, contribute to: the objectives of the Union's external policy and, in particular, the Union's humanitarian aid objectives; and reinforcing the benefits delivered to the hosting communities in third countries and the impact that the volunteer activities have on the volunteers themselves. Furthermore, the training and informal learning experience volunteers will acquire is a strong investment in human capital which would improve their employability in global economy and thus contribute to the Europe's 2020 objectives for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: interested stakeholders, including the main humanitarian aid organisations (NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Family, UN agencies), mainstream volunteer organisations, individual volunteers, Member States' representatives and other relevant actors were specifically consulted at two dedicated conferences 5 and through a public on-line consultation. An impact assessment report was prepared to examine policy options and their potential impacts. The main problems identified are: (1) lack of a structured EU approach towards volunteering; (2) poor visibility of EU humanitarian action and solidarity with people in need; (3) lack of consistent identification and selection mechanisms across Member States; (4) insufficient availability of qualified volunteers for humanitarian aid; (5) shortcomings in the surge capacity of humanitarian aid; and vi) weak capacity of hosting organisations. The impact assessment examined a number of policy options resulting from the combination of different modules and mode of management: Policy Option 1 , including: (1) Development of standards for identification, selection and training of volunteers and (2) Development of certification mechanism for sending organisations; Policy Option 2 , including the modules under Option 1 plus (3) Support to training for EU volunteers in humanitarian aid, (4) Creation of an EU Register of trained volunteers, (5) Development of standards and a certification mechanism for volunteer management in hosting organisations; Policy Option 3 , including all modules under Option 2 plus (6) Support to deployment of EU volunteers, (7) Building capacity in third country hosting organisations, (8) Establishment of an EU Network of humanitarian volunteers. This Option would be implemented in partnership with humanitarian aid organisations which should identify, select and deploy the volunteers. Policy Option 4 , including all modules under Option 3 implemented in a direct management mode by the European Commission. Based on this assessment of the potential economic, social and environmental impacts, Policy Option 3 was recommended as the most efficient and effective option for addressing the problems identified. LEGAL BASIS: Article 214(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal lays down the procedures and the rules for the operation of the EU Aid Volunteers. It follows an enabling approach and is limited to the essential elements necessary for the implementation of the Regulation, including specifying its general and operational objectives, the principles and the actions of which it consists, the provisions for financial assistance and the general provisions for its implementation. General objective and operational objectives: the objective of the EU Aid Volunteers shall be to express the Union's humanitarian values and solidarity with people in need, through the promotion of an effective and visible EU Aid Volunteers' initiative, which contributes to strengthening the Union's capacity to respond to humanitarian crises and to building the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster affected communities in third countries. The EU Aid Volunteers shall pursue the following operational objectives: Increase in and improvement of the capacity of the Union to provide humanitarian aid; Improvement of the skills and competences of volunteers in the field of humanitarian aid and the conditions under which they are working; Building the capacity of hosting organisations and foster volunteering in third countries; Promotion of the visibility of the Union's humanitarian aid values; Enhancement of coherence and consistency of volunteering across Member States in order to improve opportunities for Union citizens to participate in humanitarian aid activities and operations. Progress towards the achievement of this operational objective shall be assessed on the basis of key indicators, which shall be used for monitoring, evaluation and review of performance as appropriate. They are indicative and may be amended in order to take into account experience from the progress measurement. General principles: EU Aid Volunteers’ actions: shall be conducted in compliance with the humanitarian aid principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence; shall respond to the need of local communities and hosting organisations and should contribute to the professionalization of the provision of humanitarian aid. In this context, the safety and security of volunteers shall be a priority. The EU Aid Volunteers shall promote common activities and participation of volunteers from different countries and foster joint projects and transnational partnerships between implementing organisations. Types of actions undertaken by the volunteers: the EU Aid Volunteers shall pursue the above-mentioned objectives through the following types of actions: development and maintenance of standards regarding candidate and EU Aid Volunteers; development and maintenance of a certification mechanism for sending and hosting organisations; identification and selection of candidate volunteers; establishment of a training programme and support for training and apprenticeship placements; establishment, maintenance and updating of a Register of EU Aid Volunteers; deployment of EU Aid Volunteers in third countries for humanitarian aid activities and operations; capacity building of hosting organisations; establishment and management of an EU Aid Volunteers' Network; communication, awareness raising and visibility; ancillary activity that furthers the accountability, transparency and effectiveness of the EU Aid Volunteers. These different actions can be supported with financial assistance and implemented by different beneficiaries based on a Commission annual work programme. As regards certain specific actions, the proposal specifies the following types of actions: Standards regarding candidate and EU Aid Volunteers: the Commission will develop standards which will set the policy framework and minimum requirements to ensure effective, efficient and coherent recruitment and preparation of candidate volunteers and deployment and management of EU Aid Volunteers which are the main actions of this initiative. The standards will ensure duty of care and cover notably responsibilities of the sending and hosting organisations, minimum requirements on the coverage of subsistence, accommodation and other relevant expenses, insurance coverage and other relevant elements. Certification: sending organisations that would like to select, prepare and deploy EU Aid Volunteers will have to be certified for compliance with these standards. They should meet different eligibility requirements and follow a differentiated certification procedure (to be defined in implementing acts), taking into account their nature and capacity (e.g. Member States' public bodies, NGOs). Civil protection and development cooperation actors acting in the field of humanitarian aid shall also be considered eligible. A differentiated certification mechanism will be established for eligible hosting organisations. Although private companies are not eligible as sending or hosting organisations, they can be associated with projects and co-finance part of the costs of the volunteer to encourage corporate volunteering. Identification and selection of candidate volunteers: the EU Aid Volunteers are open for participation to Union citizens as well as nationals legally residing in the EU on a long term basis. Subject to agreements as referred to in the proposal, citizens from candidate and potential candidate countries and from partner countries from the European Neighbourhood Policy may apply to become EU Aid Volunteers. On the basis of an annual work programme, the Commission will publish calls for proposals for the identification and selection of candidate volunteers by certified sending organisations. Sending organisations that have been awarded the contracts in response to these calls will identify and select candidate volunteers for training after prior assessment of the needs in third countries by sending or hosting organisations or other relevant actors. Training and pre-deployment preparation: the selected candidate volunteers will undergo tailor-made training, taking into account their prior experience. The training programme will be organised by the Commission and will be implemented by organisations with specific training expertise. In addition, as part of their training and depending on their training needs, candidate volunteers will be able to gain practical experience through apprenticeship placements or other forms of short term predeployment preparation given by certified sending organisations. Register of EU Aid Volunteers: candidate volunteers should be assessed for their preparedness to be deployed in third countries. If successful, they should be included in a Register of EU Aid Volunteers eligible for deployment which will be managed by the Commission. The Register will also include volunteers who have already been deployed, if they are willing to be considered for future deployment. Deployment of EU Aid Volunteers in third countries: on the basis of its annual work programme, the Commission will publish calls for proposals for the deployment of EU Aid Volunteers by certified sending organisations. Sending organisations that have been awarded the contracts in response to these calls can select volunteers from the Register and deploy them to hosting organisations. The Commission may also deploy volunteers from the Register to the Commission’s humanitarian aid field offices or in response operations in third countries through the Emergency Response Centre that facilitates the Union response to disasters. The specific terms of deployment will be set-out in a contract between the sending organisation and the volunteer. Capacity building of hosting organisations: through this action, the Commission can support capacity building actions of the hosting organisations so as to ensure effective management of the EU Aid Volunteers and sustainable impact of their work, including the promotion of local volunteering. EU Aid Volunteers' Network: this action envisages the establishment of an EU Aid Volunteers' Network which will be managed by the Commission. It will consist of and facilitate interaction between the EU Aid Volunteers and will also carry out specific activities, notably through knowledge sharing and dissemination of information. It shall also support activities such as seminars, workshops and alumni activities. Communication, awareness raising and visibility: this action will support public information, communication and awareness raising actions to promote the EU Aid Volunteers and to encourage volunteering in humanitarian aid. The Commission will develop an information and communication action plan, which will be implemented by all beneficiaries, in particular sending and hosting organisations. Financial provisions: provisions are envisaged for laying down the framework for actions that are eligible for financial assistance and the potential beneficiaries of financial assistance. In this context, the Commission may consider the added-value and management advantages of creating an EU Trust Fund. Work programme: in order to implement this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt an annual work programme which will set out the objectives pursued, the expected results, the method of implementation and their total amount. It shall also contain the description of actions to be financed, an indication of the amount allocated to each action and an indicative implementation timetable. For grants, they shall include the priorities, the essential evaluation criteria and the maximum rate of co-financing. Coherence and complementarity: in implementing the Regulation, coherence shall be ensured with other areas of Union's external action and with other relevant Union policies (in particular, development policy) and with the actions undertaken in the Member States and/or with relevant international organisations. Report and evaluation: the Regulation shall be regularly evaluated, in particular in an interim report in 2017 and in the context of a final report preparing the ground for a communication on the continued of the implementation of the Regulation (by no later than 31 December 2018).. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Commission communication entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” provides, for the creation of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, with budgetary commitments amounting to EUR 239.1 million (current prices). DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission is empowered to adopt modalities of some of the actions through delegated acts on standards and amending indicators for operational objectives, or through implementing acts regarding the certification mechanism and modalities of the training programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2010, nearly one quarter of Europeans (116 million) were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This is about 2 million more than in the previous year and the first figures available for 2011 confirm this trend. About 40 million of European citizens suffer from severe material deprivation. The main features of material deprivation are the inability to access appropriate quantities and quality of food and homelessness (4.1 million were homeless in Europe in 2009/2010, according to estimates). There are 25.4 million children at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the Union. Children suffering from these forms of material deprivation are less likely than their better-off peers to do well at school, enjoy good health and realise their full potential as adults. While the needs of those who are at the margins of the society keep growing, the ability of Member States to support them has in many cases diminished. In many Member States it is felt that policies decided at European level are in some ways responsible for these developments. The Union's response to poverty and material deprivation: the main Union's instrument for supporting employability, fighting poverty and promoting social inclusion is and will remain the European Social Fund (ESF). Next to that, the EU's Food Distribution programme for the Most Deprived People (MDP) has for more than two decades provided food aid for those persons. It was created in 1987 to make meaningful use of agricultural surpluses, which might otherwise have been destroyed, by making them available to Member States wishing to use them. Over the years, the scheme became an important source of provisions for organisations working in direct contact with the least fortunate members of society, providing them with food. The expected depletion and high unpredictability of intervention stocks over the period 2011-2020, as a consequence of successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, has deprived the MDP of the original rationale underpinning it and it will be discontinued at the end of 2013. The potential significant cut in the support provided under the MDP scheme in 2012 was heavily criticized by civil society organisations, with regional and local authorities' representatives stressing the importance of this support and pleading for its continuation at a time when needs are increasing. Discussions in the Council and the European Parliament and with civil society and local authorities on the current forms of aid for the most deprived under the MDP programme have provided meaningful insights and ideas for the future. On the other hand, Member States’ views about such an instrument are divided: seven Member States have expressed their opposition to continuation of the MDP beyond 2013. Other Member States have argued strongly in support of the scheme. The European Parliament has repeatedly expressed strong support for the continuation of the food aid programme in the interest of better social cohesion in Europe. It called for a strategy to be drawn up on the subject – firstly, in a written declaration (2010) and then in a resolution (2011). Given persistent material deprivation, EU assistance to the most deprived in society remains necessary. In its proposal for the next multiannual financial framework the Commission has reflected this and reserved a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a new instrument designed to fight extreme forms of poverty and exclusion. Against this background, the proposed Regulation establishes for the period 2014-2020 a new instrument that will complement the existing cohesion instruments and notably the European Social Fund, by addressing the worst and most socially corrosive forms of poverty, food deprivation as well as homelessness and material deprivation of children while supporting accompanying measures aiming at the social reintegration of the most deprived persons of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the core issue examined by the impact assessment concerned the scope of the new instrument. The options considered were: Option 0 : no funding; Option 1 : a successor instrument to the current MDP limited to dispensing food aid; Option 2 : an instrument which would complement the distribution of food aid with support for accompanying measures aiming at the social inclusion of the food aid recipients, and Option 3 : a comprehensive instrument supporting material relief in terms of food, goods for homeless people and goods for materially deprived children, combined with accompanying measures aiming at the social reintegration of the most deprived persons. The net impact of Option 0 depends on how the funds made available are reallocated. But it would certainly be seen as attesting to an erosion of solidarity in Europe at a time when poverty is increasing. Compared to Option 1, Option 2 and even more so Option 3 entail a reduction of the food aid distributed as some resources are allocated to other types of actions. However, the accompanying measures should also ensure greater sustainability of the results achieved. Option 3 is preferred because it best allows tailoring the supported interventions to local needs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 175(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this Commission proposal related to the creation of a European Fund for the most deprived for the period 2014-2020. The proposed Regulation defines the objectives and scope, sets down the available financial resources and the various eligibility criteria, and lays down the rules to ensure the Fund’s effectiveness. General and specific objectives: the general objective of the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (the Fund) is to promote social cohesion in the Union by contributing to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy's objective of reducing by at least 20 million of the number of people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion. This translates into the specific objective of supporting national schemes which provide non-financial assistance to the most deprived persons through partner organisations. Scope: the Fund addresses food deprivation, homelessness and material deprivation of children. Each Member State may choose to address one or more of these forms of deprivation. It may also support accompanying measures, complementing material support, to contribute to the social reintegration of the most deprived persons. Eligible population and targeting: the population eligible to receive material assistance comprises the most deprived persons of the Union. Definition of the criteria for identifying the most deprived persons to be assisted will be the responsibility of the Member States or the partner organisations since they are best placed to target the assistance taking local needs into account. By defining the type of goods that will be distributed, namely food or basic consumer goods for personal use of homeless persons or of children, the Regulation also contains an indirect targeting mechanism. N.B. the Fund may only be used to support distribution of food or goods that are in conformity with the Union legislation on consumer product safety. Partner organisations: the partner organisations are the ones that deliver directly or indirectly the food or goods to the most deprived persons. In order to ensure that the Fund will contribute to sustainable reduction of poverty and to improvement of social cohesion, the partner organisations that deliver directly the food or goods will themselves have to undertake activities complementing the provision of material assistance, aiming at the social integration of the most deprived persons. The Fund itself may support such accompanying measures. The national authorities may either purchase the food or goods or make them available to partner organisations or provide the partner organisation with funding for the purchase of the food or goods. If the purchase of food or goods is undertaken by a partner organisation, it can either distribute the items itself or entrust the distribution to other partner organisations. Implementing provisions: the Fund will be implemented following the model of cohesion policy, i.e. through shared management on the basis of one 7-year operational programme per Member State covering the period 2014 to 2020. Implementation arrangements: the proposal follows the approach of the structural funds in terms of implementation arrangements, allowing notably the Member States to use, if they so wish, the structures, designated authorities and procedures set up for the European Social Fund, in order to minimize the administrative burden related to the transition from the current scheme for distribution of food to the most deprived persons to the new Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived. The provisions relating to programming, monitoring, evaluation and information and communication are, however, streamlined and simplified in order to be commensurate to the specificity of the objectives and target populations of the Fund. Eligibility rules: the eligibility rules are also designed to take into account the nature of the Fund and of the various actors that will be involved in its implementation. In particular, the Regulation provides for simplified cost methods for the majority of categories of expenditure and opens options for the others categories. Financial management of the Fund: the financial management and control system also derives from the structural funds logic. Also, some provisions have been adapted and simplified to be fully adequate to the types of operations that will be supported by the Fund, notably in terms of pre-financing, content of the payments applications to the Commission as well as proportional control. The partner organisations have a limited capacity to advance the funds necessary. Likewise, the Member States may have difficulties to mobilise the resources necessary to pre-finance the operations. In addition, the Member States facing the greatest fiscal constraints are likely to be those with the highest number of most deprived people. In order to address this situation, that could put at risk the achievement of the Fund's objective, the level of pre-financing is set at 11% of the total allocation to a Member State. This will allow covering up to 90% of the costs of the first year's aid campaign not counting technical assistance, transport, administrative costs and the accompanying measures. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the Fund for the period 2014-2020 shall be EUR 2.5 billion at 2011 prices, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in an annex to the proposal. For the purpose of programming and subsequent inclusion in the general budget of the Union, the amount of resources shall be indexed at 2% per year. Criteria will be laid down by the Commission, by means of implementing acts, setting out the annual breakdown of the global resources by Member State, taking into account the following indicators established by Eurostat: the population suffering from severe material deprivation; the population living in households with very low work intensity. 0.35% of the global resources shall be allocated to technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. Appropriations of around EUR 7.112 million between 2012 and 2020 are also provide for the management of the Fund (Heading 5 of the multiannual framework – human and administrative resources). DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty shall be devolved to the Commission in respect of the responsibilities of Member States concerning: the procedure for reporting irregularities and recovery of sums unduly paid, the modalities of exchange of information of operations, the arrangements for the adequate audit trail, the conditions of national audits, the designation criteria for managing authorities and certifying authorities, the identification of commonly accepted data carriers, and the criteria for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: on 26 March 2010, the European Council agreed to the European Commission's proposal to launch a new strategy for jobs and growth, Europe 2020, based on enhanced coordination of economic policies, which will focus on the key areas where action is needed to boost Europe’s potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness. To that end, the European Council agreed to set EU headline targets, which constitute shared objectives guiding action of the Member States and of the Union. The Treaty on the functioning of the EU provides that Member States are to regard their economic policies and promoting employment as matters of common concern and coordinate them within the Council. In two distinct articles, it provides that the Council is to adopt broad economic policy guidelines (Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article 148), specifying that the latter must be consistent with the former. Given this legal basis, the guidelines for employment and economic policies are presented as two distinct — but intrinsically interconnected — legal instruments: A Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union -Part I of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines; A Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States –Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines. These guidelines implemented by the above mentioned legal instruments form together the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. The employment guidelines were adopted on 21 October 2010, and as provided by the adoption decision should remain stable until 2014 to ensure a focus on implementation. The overall objectives and priorities expressed in the guidelines for the employment policies remain valid. Consequently, with this proposal, the Commission maintains the guidelines adopted in 2010. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission proposes that the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States set out in the Annex to Council Decision of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States are maintained for 2014 as they were in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The employment guidelines shall be taken into account by the Member States in their employment policies."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Directive 2012/34/EU. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its White Paper on transport policy of 28 March 2011, the Commission announced its intention to complete the internal railway market, allowing railway undertakings of the Union to provide all types of rail transport services without unnecessary technical and administrative barriers. In the last decade, three legislative ‘railway packages’ have aimed at opening up national markets and making railways more competitive and interoperable at EU level. Despite the new EU legislation, the modal share (6%) of rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. A number of problems need to be addressed: - the difficulty in accessing national passenger transport services: in many Member States, the market for domestic passenger services is closed to competition, which limits their development. This also creates disparities between those Member States that have opened their markets, and those that have not; - the governance of infrastructure managers: since infrastructure managers are natural monopolies, they do not always react to the needs of the market and its users; - a number of market entry barriers result from situations where infrastructure management and transport operations are part of the same integrated structure, with infrastructure managers facing a conflict of interest; - lastly, integrated structures make it much more difficult to enforce the separation of accounts between infrastructure management and transport operations. This proposal to amend Directive 2012/34/EU forms part of the Fourth Railway Package the overall objective of which is to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing any remaining legal, institutional and technical obstacles, and fostering the performance of the railway sector and its competitiveness, in order to further develop the Single European Railway Area. IMPACT ANALYSIS: based on an external study and the conclusions of a targeted consultation, the Commission carried out an impact assessment of the proposed measures, which examined options for new measures aiming to modernise the existing regulatory framework. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal encompasses provisions with the following aims: 1. The opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail with the objective of intensifying competitive pressure on domestic rail markets. The Commission proposes to open, from December 2019, all national passenger transport routes to new entrants and service providers. 2. Enhancing governance of the infrastructure manager with the objective of ensuring equal access to the infrastructure. To this end, the proposal seeks to: - remove conflicts of interest affecting decisions of the infrastructure manager on market access and eliminate the potential for cross-subsidisation, which exists in integrated structures; - ensure that all of the infrastructure manager’s functions will be managed in a consistent manner; - strengthen coordination between infrastructure managers and rail operators to better respond to market needs; - create a forum for the cooperation of infrastructure managers across borders; - establish information and integrated ticketing schemes common to all railway undertakings operating domestic passenger services in a way that does not distort competition. The proposal allows vertically integrated undertakings, including those with a holding structure, to maintain ownership of the infrastructure manager on condition that there are strong and efficient safeguards protecting the infrastructure manager’s independence. Verification of compliance: Member States could limit access rights of railway operators which are part of vertically integrated undertakings, where the Commission is not in a position to confirm that safeguards to protect the independence of the infrastructure manager have been effectively implemented. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directive 2008/57/EC on railway interoperability). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the last decade, the EU railway market has witnessed profound changes, gradually introduced by three legislative ‘railway packages’ intended to open up the national markets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level, while maintaining high level of safety. However, the modal share of rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. This is why the Commission has put forward the Fourth Railway Package in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing the remaining market obstacles. This proposal for a Directive, along with the proposal to recast Directive 2004/49/EC on rail safety, are part of this fourth package which focuses on the removal of remaining administrative and technical barriers by: establishing a common approach to safety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway undertakings active across the EU; decreasing administrative costs, accelerating administrative procedures, as well as avoiding disguised discrimination, relying on the European Railways Agency. Several lessons have been learned based on the work done on developing technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) and the application of the interoperability Directives to specific projects. Furthermore, the legislative context for the marketing of products has evolved in recent years, with the result that the interoperability legislation needs to be updated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment. In order to support the Commission in the impact assessment process, an external consultant was tasked to prepare an impact assessment support study and to undertake a targeted consultation of stakeholders. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1), Article 170 and Article 171 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission’s proposal to amend Directive 2008/57/EC may be summarised as follows: as regards the scope, the interoperability of local, urban and suburban systems is considered to have been adequately addressed in the voluntary field and does not need to be covered by this Directive; several definitions were reworded or added; further provisions are to be specified in the TSIs to cover existing subsystems and to enable railway undertakings to check compatibility between vehicles and routes on which these vehicles are intended to be operated; the use of Agency opinions pending the amendment of TSIs as a result of deficiencies discovered, is clarified; the cases of possible non-application of TSIs have been reduced; the role of national rules, the cases in which national rules may be introduced, and the procedures for their withdrawal and their publication have been clarified, as have the circumstances which trigger a new EC declaration of verification; the placing on the market of mobile subsystems, which can be done by both railway undertakings and manufacturers; a new provision introduces the notion of vehicle authorisation for placing on the market. This authorisation is issued by the Agency and contains all information needed later by the railway undertaking to place a vehicle in commercial service. An optional complementary statement will facilitate the railway undertaking in its task of placing the vehicle in service; the role of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers in checking the technical compatibility of the vehicle with the route and the safe integration of the vehicle in the system in which it is intended to operate is clarified; two new articles concerning conformity assessment bodies replace and complement some existing provisions to include the provisions of the new legislative framework for the marketing of products as defined in Decision 768/2008/EC; articles on European Vehicle Number (EVN) and registers have been updated; as a consequence of the Lisbon Treaty, a certain number of the annexes of Directive 2008/57/EC into implementing acts to be adopted by the Commission. It should be noted that the fourth railway package also includes: (i) a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and (ii) a proposal amending Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

In order to pursue efforts to establish a single market for rail transport services, it is necessary to establish a common regulatory framework for railway safety. Member States have until now developed their safety rules and standards mainly on national lines. Differences in principles, approach and culture have made it difficult to break through the technical barriers and establish international transport operations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment. In order to support the Commission in the impact assessment process, an external consultant was tasked to prepare an impact assessment support study and to undertake a targeted consultation of stakeholders. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to amend the current regulatory framework with a view to: facilitating the creation and implementation of a single EU safety certificate, in accordance with the recommendation of the European Railways Agency. Access to the railway infrastructure would only be granted to railway undertakings holding a safety certificate. In this regard, the proposal introduces amendments designed to take into account the new role of the national safety agencies in the transition process towards a single safety certificate and the reallocation of responsibilities between them and the Agency. adapting the text to take into account developments in the rail market : the current trend of outsourcing activities or services is leading to the emergence of new actors subject to increasing economic and financial pressure, while internal control is decreasing. This may have consequences for safety, unless a new way of monitoring is established, through contractual or other arrangements, to ensure that risk control measures are duly implemented by all relevant actors. Other proposed changes include: adapting the scope and definitions to improve consistency with the Interoperability Directive; adapting the provision regarding national rules to take into account the evolution of the legal framework (adoption of technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs)), in accordance with the conclusions of the Task Force established for the purpose; clarifying the cooperation between the national investigation body and the judicial authorities in case of investigation following an accident. It should be noted that the fourth railway package also includes: (i) a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and (ii) a proposal amending Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the last decade, the EU railway market has witnessed profound changes, gradually introduced by three legislative ‘railway packages’ intended to open up the national markets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level, while maintaining high level of safety.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the baseline scenario (Option 1), the Commission identified five options: Option 2: greater coordination role for the Agency in ensuring a consistent approach to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation; Option 3: European Railways Agency (ERA) as a one-stop-shop, where the final decision on certification and authorisation remains with the national safety agencies (NSAs) but ERA performs entry and exit checks of applications and of the decisions; Option 4: ERA and NSAs share competencies, where the final decision on certification and authorisation is taken by the Agency; Option 5: ERA takes over activities of NSAs in relation to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation; Option 6: horizontal measures that could be implemented to improve the competitiveness of the rail sector. The environmental impact of all the options was assessed as positive, though low. The social impact of all the options was assessed as low/marginal. It was concluded that Option 4 (combined with Option 6) was the preferred option as it provides the best balance of outcomes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation seeks to add new tasks to the European Railway Agency making it a truly European Railway Authority in the field of interoperability and safety. The Agency should in particular: play the role of European authority responsible for issuing authorisations for placing on the market for railway vehicles and for types of vehicles, safety certificates for railway undertakings and authorisations for placing in service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems; monitor national railway rules and the performance of national authorities acting in the railway interoperability and safety fields; provide independent and objective technical support, predominantly to the Commission; have a strengthened role in the field of telematics applications to ensure their consistent development and swift deployment; be given a more important role to ensure the consistent development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). The proposal also provides for the establishment of an appeal mechanism so that decisions of the Executive Director can be subject to appeal to a specialised Board of Appeal, whose decisions are, in turn, open to action before the Court of Justice. Lastly, in order to perform its tasks properly, the Agency should have legal personality and an autonomous budget funded mainly through a contribution by the Union and through fees and charges paid by applicants. It should be noted that the fourth railway package also includes: (i) a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and (ii) a proposal amending Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the new proposal for a Regulation constitutes a legislative basis for commitments in terms of budget and staff for the Agency. The implication for expenditure is estimated at EUR 161.118 million for the period 2015-2020. These figures are provisional because they depend on the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020 by the budgetary authority.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 allows Member States to compensate 36 enumerated railway undertakings for the payment of obligations which undertakings of other transport modes do not have to support, such as special family allowances and pensions. When the rules for normalisation are correctly applied, such State support is considered compatible with the internal market and Member States are exempted from State aid notification obligations, Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 was adopted before the rail market was liberalised and when rail transport in Europe was developing primarily within national borders, with integrated companies both operating rail services and managing rail infrastructure. Today, this Regulation is inconsistent and incompatible with legislative measures currently in force, as well as with the fundamental principles laid down in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a single European railway area which include that: (i) railway undertakings shall be managed according to principles that apply to commercial companies; (ii) entities responsible for the allocation of capacity and charging for rail infrastructure shall be separate from entities which operate rail services; (iii) there shall be a separation of accounts; (iv) any railway undertaking licensed in accordance with EU criteria should have access to railway infrastructure on fair, non-discriminatory terms; and (v) that infrastructure managers may benefit from State financing. Regulation (EEC) In the context of a liberalised market where railway undertakings compete directly with the traditional monopolies listed in the Regulation, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to discriminate between these two groups of undertakings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. However, it requested information from Member States about application of the Regulation in May 2010 and in June 2011. Responses revealed that, between 2007 and 2010, a majority of Member States had not received applications from railway undertakings and had not made payments of compensation under the Regulation. A majority of Member States indicated they saw no ongoing need for the Regulation and some explicitly expressed their support for repeal or their opinion that the Regulation is obsolete or out of date. On the basis of the data provided by Member States, it was concluded that the impact of a repeal of the Regulation would be very minimal. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91 and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 to eliminate inconsistencies in the EU legal order and will contribute to simplification by eliminating a legal act which is now obsolete.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the average annual rate of fatal accidents in scheduled passenger operations in the EU has remained more or less stable for the past years. However, it is feared that with the air traffic growth forecast for the next decades there will be an increase in the number of accidents. Experience has shown that often before an accident occurs, a number of incidents and numerous other deficiencies have shown the existence of safety hazards. Whilst the ability to learn lessons from an accident is crucial, purely reactive systems have shown their limit in continuing to bring forward improvements. In this context, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has encouraged the transition towards a more proactive and evidence-based safety approach. At Union level, Directive 2003/42/EC established the basis for a proactive and evidence-based aviation safety management system in the European Union by imposing the reporting of occurrences. However, the European Union and its Member States are currently not sufficiently able to use experience feedback for preventing accidents and the current legislation is insufficient to prevent that the number of accidents and related fatalities would increase as a consequence of the expected traffic growth. The improvement of civil aviation safety requires that relevant civil aviation safety information should be reported, collected, stored, protected, exchanged, disseminated, analysed and that appropriate safety actions should be taken on the basis of the information collected. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the option of not introducing any change to the current situation, three policy packages were considered to assess how Directive 2003/42/EC could be revised. · Policy package 1 aims at improving the current system through amendment to the legislation limited to what is strictly necessary and to the adoption of recommendations and guidance wherever possible; · Policy package 2 consists of a more ambitious package of policy measures entailing a substantial revision of EU legislation on occurrence reporting; · Policy package 3 aims at improving the current system by transferring Member States occurrence reporting competencies to the EU level and establishing requirements for occurrence analysis together with the adoption of necessary safety actions and improvement in monitoring. On the basis of the efficiency, effectiveness and consistency criteria, it is recommended that policy package 2 should be implemented, as its benefits would be considerably higher than the costs incurred. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to contribute to the reduction of the number of aircraft accidents and related fatalities, through the improvement of existing systems, both at national and European level, using civil aviation occurrences for correcting safety deficiencies and prevent them from recurring. The main points of the proposal are as follows: 1) Better collection of occurrences : the proposal establishes the appropriate framework for ensuring that all occurrences that endanger or would endanger aviation safety are reported. The proposal: · maintains the obligation to establish mandatory occurrence reporting systems (MORS) and lists the persons obliged to report, as well as the occurrences to be reported under the MORS; · imposes the establishment of voluntary systems whose aim is to collect occurrences which have not been captured by the MORS; · contains provisions ensuring that aviation professionals are encouraged to report safety-related information by protecting them from punishment, except in cases of gross negligence. 2) Clarification of the flow of information : the proposal requires organisations and Member States to establish occurrence reporting systems which will enable the identification of safety hazards. The occurrences collected by organisations must be transmitted to Member States’ competent authorities or to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), when appropriate. All occurrences collected by Member States, organisations and EASA are aggregated into the European Central Repository. 3) Improved quality and completeness of data : in order to ensure better identification of key risk areas and of measures to be taken, occurrence reports will have to contain minimum information and mandatory data fields, such as the date of the occurrence, the occurrence category or the narrative of the occurrence, will be introduced. The proposal also includes: · the obligation to classify occurrences in terms of risk according to a European common risk classification scheme; · procedures for implementing data quality checks , notably to ensure consistency between an occurrence report and the initial information collected from the reporter. The Commission will support Member States in reaching higher data quality and completeness standards by supporting the development of guidance material and the use of workshops. 4) Better exchange of information : access by Member States and EASA to the European Central Repository, which contains all occurrences collected by Member States as well as by EASA, is extended to all data and information contained in the database. In addition, when, in the assessment of data collected through occurrence reporting systems, an authority identifies safety matters considered to be of interest for another authority, it shall forward the information in a timely manner. In order to facilitate the exchange of data and information, the text requires that all occurrence reports should be compatible with the ECCAIRS software (this software is used by all Member States and for the European Central Repository) and with the ADREP taxonomy (the ICAO taxonomy also used in the ECCAIRS software). 5) Better protection against inappropriate use of safety information : the proposal strengthens the rules on ensuring that, besides the obligation to guarantee the confidentiality of the data collected, such information can only be made available and used for the purpose of maintaining or improving aviation safety. 6) Better protection of reporter to ensure the continued availability of information : the text reaffirms the obligation to render anonymous occurrence reports and it limits access to fully identified data only to certain persons. In addition, Member States are asked to refrain from instituting proceedings except in cases of gross negligence. Organisations are also asked to adopt a policy describing how the employees' protection is guaranteed. National bodies must be established, allowing employees to report infringements to the rules which guarantee their protection and penalties should be adopted, where appropriate. 7) Introduction of requirements on information analysis and follow up actions at national level : the proposal imposes new requirements which transpose into EU law the rules related to analysis and follow up of occurrences collected, which have been agreed at international level. Organisations and Member States are required to analyse the information collected through occurrence reporting systems in order to identify safety risks and to take actions in order to remedy to any safety deficiency identified. 8) Strengthen analysis at EU level : analysis at EU level will complement what is done at national level notably by the identification of possible safety problems and key risk areas at European level. 9) Improved transparency towards the general public : the proposal provides for the publication of annual safety reviews containing information about actions taken in application of the regulation, trends and aggregated data. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this is related to additional human resources for the European Aviation Safety Agency (involved through the Network of Analysts) and additional budget for mission and outreach activities. Both additional human resources (2 posts estimated at EUR 300 000 per year) and additional budget (mission and outreach activities estimated at EUR 65 000 per year) will be fully covered by redeployment within the existing resources of the Agency. Therefore the impact on the EU budget is neutral. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

Action is needed at EU level in order to guarantee interoperability and continuity of the service throughout Europe. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed three options : Option 1 : no EU action; Option 2 : voluntary approach; Option 3 : regulatory measures. Option 3 is the chosen option. The benefits identified through the impact assessment include: · reduction of fatalities (with all vehicles eCall-equipped, between 1% and 10% depending on country population density, road and emergency response infrastructure); · reduction of seriousness of the injuries (between 2% and 15%); · reduction of congestion costs caused by traffic accidents; · facilitation of rescue services and increased security of rescue team (e.g. firefighters) when extracting trapped occupants, as the Minimum Set of Data (“MSD”) in the eCall message will, among others, provide information on the fuel type; · reduced SOS roadside infrastructure, as each road user would be able to trigger an emergency call from their vehicle. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation forms part of a set of EU legal acts for ensuring the deployment of the 112-based eCall service by 1 October 2015. The other main legislative acts linked to this eCall initiative are: Commission Recommendation 2011/750/EU of 8 September 2011 as well as the Proposal for Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deployment of the interoperable EU-wide eCall. The proposal: requires new types of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to be constructed as to ensure that in the event of a severe accident an emergency call (eCall) to the 112 is triggered automatically. It must also be possible to trigger manually emergency calls (eCalls) to the 112; provides for rules concerning privacy and data protection. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no budgetary implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the healthcare sector is one of the largest in the EU: it accounts for approximately 10% of the EU’s gross domestic product and employs one in ten workers, with a higher than average proportion of workers with tertiary-level education. Health therefore plays an important role in the Europe 2020 agenda . As underlined in its Communication of 29 June 2011 entitled “ A budget for Europe 2020 ”, this third programme of EU action in the field of health (2014-2020), ‘Health for Growth’, strengthens and emphasises the links between economic growth and a healthy population to a greater extent than the previous programmes. The Programme is geared towards actions with clear EU added value. The general objectives of the Health for Growth Programme shall be to work with Member States to: encourage innovation in healthcare, increase the sustainability of health systems, and improve the health of the EU citizens and protect them from cross-border health threats. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment looked at different options for the programme and their expected impact: Option 1 : minimal action: this option corresponds to the absolute minimum of actions resulting from the legal obligations imposed by the Treaty and the existing EU acquis in the field of medicinal products, medical devices, substances of human origin, patients rights in cross border healthcare, Health security (cross border health threats) and tobacco. Option 2 : baseline scenario: this option implies continuing the programme in its present form with no changes consequently to the findings of the evaluations, in addition to the direct legal obligations. ·  Option 3, sub-option A : this option corresponds to a well structured programme, with SMART objectives, prioritised actions, creating EU added value and with better monitoring of outcomes and impacts. It will be focused on: i) supporting actions required by the current EU health and internal market legislation, ii) supporting the up-take of innovative solutions for improving specific points concerning the quality, efficiency and sustainability of health systems, iii) prevention of diseases at EU level by helping and complementing Member States’ efforts to increase their citizens’ number of healthy life years (HLY), including the aspect of reduction of health inequalities but mainly by other means than the resources of the Programme and limited to development of working methods and policy evaluation; iv) supporting and complementing Member States efforts in protecting citizens from cross-border health threats. ·  Sub-option 3, sub-option B: this option corresponds to a well structured programme but dealing only with one of the general objectives as a trade off. This programme would be focused on: i) supporting actions required by the current EU health and internal market legislation, ii) supporting the up-take of innovative solutions for improving specific points concerning the quality, efficiency and sustainability of health, iii) supporting and complementing Member States efforts in protecting citizens from cross-border health threats. ·  Sub-option 3, sub-option C: this option corresponds to a programme limited to supporting actions required by the current EU health related legislation and to supporting solutions for cross border health threats. In addition, there would be some dissemination of the results of the current Health Programme (2008–2013) in order to take into account the conclusions of previous evaluations. Option 4: this corresponds to a well-structured programme focusing on the same issues as option 3 A but adding a specific objective for addressing wider, social and economic, causes of health inequalities by appropriate financial means. This option would imply a significant increase of the envelope for the Programme. Following analysis of the results, Option 3A is the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 168 (5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the general objectives of the Health for Growth Programme shall be to work with Member States to encourage innovation in healthcare and increase the sustainability of health systems, to improve the health of the EU citizens and protect them from cross-border health threats. It focuses on four specific objectives with a strong potential for economic growth through better health: 1) to develop common tools and mechanisms at EU level to address shortages of resources, both human and financial and to facilitate up-take of innovation in healthcare in order to contribute to innovative and sustainable health systems; 2) to increase access to medical expertise and information for specific conditions also beyond national borders and to develop shared solutions and guidelines to improve healthcare quality and patient safety in order to increase access to better and safer healthcare for EU citizens; 3) to identify, disseminate and promote the up-take of validated best practices for cost-effective prevention measures by addressing the key risk factors, namely smoking, abuse of alcohol and obesity, as well as HIV/AIDS, with a focus on the cross border dimension, in order to prevent diseases and promote good health; and 4) to develop common approaches and demonstrate their value for better preparedness and coordination in health emergencies in order to protect citizens from crossborder health threats. Eligible actions: the proposal lays down the actions eligible under the programme. Actions that will be eligible will be those that: Contribute to innovative and sustainable health systems : e.g. developing EU cooperation on Health Technology Assessment; promoting the uptake of health innovation and e-Health by increasing the interoperability of e-Health applications; supporting the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, a pilot project under Europe 2020 flagship initiative Innovation Union; fostering a health knowledge system,… Increase access to better and safer healthcare for citizens : e.g. supporting action on rare diseases including creation of European Reference Networks; strengthening collaboration on patient safety and quality of healthcare, by increasing the availability of information to patients, exchanging of best practices and development of guidelines; developing guidelines to improve the prudent use of antimicrobials in human medicine and reducing the practices that increase antimicrobial resistance,… Promote good health and preventing diseases : e.g. exchanging best practices on key health issues such as smoking prevention, abuse of alcohol and obesity; supporting the prevention of chronic diseases including cancer, by sharing knowledge and best practice and developing joint activities,… Protect citizens from cross border health threats : e.g. strengthening preparedness and response for serious cross border health threats; supporting capacity building against health threats in Member States,… A more detailed description of the content those actions may have is included in Annex I of the proposed Regulation. Participation of third countries: the Programme shall be open on a cost basis, to the participation of third countries, in particular of: · acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates benefiting from a pre-accession strategy, ·  EFTA/EEA countries, ·  neighbouring countries and the countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) applies, ·  other countries in accordance with the conditions laid down by a relevant bilateral or multilateral agreement. Types of intervention and participation: financial contributions by the Union may take the form of either grants or public procurement or any other interventions necessary for achieving the objectives of the Programme. The proposal describes the forms of intervention by type of action eligible. Overall; the design of the revised programme favours simplification of interventions: ·  simplified rules, ·  reducing the costs of participation, ·  accelerating award procedures, and · providing a ""one-stop shop"" to make it easier for beneficiaries to access EU funding. Budget and rate of co-financing : the programme will have a budget of EUR 446 million from 2014-2020. The level of Union co-financing for grants for actions, actions co-financed by the competent authorities of the Member States or third countries, or by non-governmental bodies mandated by these authorities and operating grants will be harmonised at 60% of eligible costs and up to 80% in cases of exceptional utility. Provisions are foreseen to define the rules regarding eligibility for grants for actions covered by the Programme. Grants may be awarded to legally established organisations, public authorities, public sector bodies, in particular research and health institutions, universities and higher education establishments and undertakings, in accordance with strictly defined criteria. Administrative and technical assistance : the financial allocation for the Programme may also cover expenses pertaining to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities required directly for the management of the Programme and the achievement of its objectives, in particular studies, meetings, information and communication actions, including corporate communication of the political priorities of the EU, as well as all other technical and administrative assistance expense incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme. Methods of implementation: the Commission shall be responsible for the implementation of the Programme by drawing up annual work programmes establishing the priorities and actions to be undertaken, as well as other detailed eligibility criteria for the beneficiaries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Consistency and complementarity with other policies: the Commission shall, in cooperation with the Member States, ensure overall consistency and complementarity between the Programme and other policies, instruments and actions of the Union. Monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of results: the usual methods of monitoring, evaluation, dissemination of results and combating fraud are foreseen in the proposal. The Commission shall, in close cooperation with the Member States, monitor the implementation of the actions under the programme in the light of its objectives and indicators and keep the European Parliament informed thereof. Reporting : no later then mid-2018, an evaluation report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of all the measures (at the level of results and impacts), the efficiency of the use of resources and its European added value, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the measures. The longer-term impacts and the sustainability of effects of the Health for Growth Programme should be evaluated with a view to feeding into a decision on a possible renewal, modification or suspension of a subsequent programme. It should be noted that the Member States shall designate National Focal Points which shall assist the Commission in the promotion of the Programme, the dissemination of its results and the information on its impacts in their respective countries. Repeal: Decision No 1350/2007/EC shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the financial appropriations for implementing the programme over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 will amount to EUR 446 million (in current prices)."

BACKGROUND: On 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted the Communication ""A Budget for Europe 2020"" on the next multi-annual financial framework (MFF) (2014-2020), which proposes the creation of a Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to promote the completion of priority energy, transport and digital infrastructures with a single fund of EUR 40 billion, out of which the Commission proposed that EUR 9.2 billion are be dedicated to digital networks and services. On 8 February 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions on a new MFF setting the budget for ""CEF Digital"" at EUR 1 billion. On this basis, the Commission now proposes to modify its proposal for a Regulation on guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks. At the time of writing, the negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament on the next Multiannual Financial Framework have not yet been concluded. Likewise, negotiations on the proposal for a Regulation establishing the CEF are on-going. CONTENT: the modified proposal takes, to the extent possible, account of the latest positions in the Council and in the relevant European Parliament committee. It aims to focus the CEF intervention on a smaller number of digital service infrastructures, based on a stringent set of criteria for prioritisation, and a limited contribution to broadband via financial instruments, with a view to leverage private investment as well as investment from public sources other than CEF. Despite its limited financial contribution regarding broadband, the proposal sets a framework enabling wider contributions from business and institutional players such as the European Investment Bank. Hence, CEF will only be able to finance a limited number of broadband projects by itself, but in addition it will facilitate the efficient allocation of, for example, European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), by enabling Managing Authorities to make a contribution from the operational programmes. For digital service infrastructures , taking account of the proposed budgetary restrictions, two services have been not been a retained in the annex of this proposal (""Trans-European high-speed backbone connections for public administrations"", ""Information and communication technology solutions for intelligent energy networks and for the provision of Smart Energy Services""), while one general service infrastructure has been added The European Parliament's Industry, Research and Energy Committee added additional digital service infrastructures on ""Deployment of infrastructures in public transports allowing the use of secure and interoperable mobile proximity services"", ""Online Dispute Resolution Platform"", ""European Platform for Access to Educational Resources"", and ""Cross border interoperable electronic invoicing services"". Some of them are retained in the annex of the present proposal. In the area of broadband , the present proposal foresees the setting up of financial instruments with a view to providing an efficient way to allocate, inter alia, structural funds. Both Council and Parliament shared the view that the intervention should not displace private investment and that it should be based on the principle of technological neutrality. By insisting that EU funds be prioritised to state-of-the art technologies, while giving Member States flexibility in the choice of projects in their countries that would benefit from access to long term funds, the present proposal reaffirms the link to the Digital Agenda targets, while retaining the spirit of preferences expressed by both institutions. On the method of intervention , i.e. grants or financial instruments (loans, guarantees, project bonds, equity), the present proposal only provides for the setting up of financial instruments, as sources of efficiently priced long term funds, aligned to the infrastructure needs. Lastly, on horizontal points , the original Commission proposal foresaw Delegated Act powers to amend the list of Projects of Common Interest in the Annex. The present proposal takes account of the concerns expressed in particular by Member States, and instead foresees sufficiently flexible wording in the Annex, and recognises that the necessary programme adjustments will be made by Implementing Act. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the final amount allocated to telecommunications will be known once the political agreement on the MFF figures will be reached and the new legal base is adopted by the Legislative Authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the website-developer market consisted of some 175 000 enterprises in the 27 EU Member States. It employed some 1 million people and the generated turnover was EUR 144 billion. The European market for web-accessibility related products and services is estimated at EUR 2 billion. It could grow significantly, as less than 10% of websites are accessible. The number of websites providing e-government services (about 380 500 in the EU) and public sector websites (over 761 000 in the EU) is growing rapidly. Most Member States have already either enacted legislation, or taken other measures on web accessibility. However, significant differences exist between these laws and measures. The non-harmonised national approaches to web-accessibility create barriers in the Internal Market. Harmonisation of national measures for the public sector at EU level is being proposed as a necessary condition to put an end to this fragmentation and lack of confidence in the web accessibility market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. An Impact Assessment Steering Group, led by the Directorate General for the Information Society and Media, was established with a wide representation of services and departments of the Commission. The Commission believes that harmonisation will lead to better market conditions, more jobs, cheaper web-accessibility and more accessible websites: a triple win for governments, businesses, and citizens. In addition, the Directive would support Member States in achieving their national commitments regarding web accessibility, as well as their commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities regarding websites of public sector bodies. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Directive aims at approximating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on the accessibility of public sector bodies' websites, by defining harmonised requirements. Purpose and scope: the proposal lays down the technical provisions whereby Member States shall make accessible the content of certain types of websites of public sector bodies which provide information and services that are essential for citizens' participation in economy and society (e.g. income tax, employment services, social security, personal documents, vehicle registration, police statements, university or higher education enrolment). Requirements for web-accessibility: the requirements for web-accessibility are defined along two dimensions: (i) user orientation; and (ii) market orientation and interoperability. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to specify further, where appropriate, the harmonised requirements necessary to ensure the accessibility of the websites concerned. In order to ensure that current political commitments are promptly achieved, the above provisions are to be implemented by 31 December 2015. Harmonised standards and presumption of conformity: this Directive is in line with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on European Standardisation which sets the legal basis for the Commission to request European standardisation organisations to develop harmonised standards to assist stakeholders in providing presumption of conformity. In one of the Directive’s recitals, it is indicated that the Success Criteria and Requirements for Level AA conformance specified in the version 2.0 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) issued by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), are expected to be taken into account in the European standard resulting from Mandate 376 and subsequently in the harmonised standard that should be built upon the outcome of this work.. These technology neutral specifications provide the basis for the requirements for web-accessibility. European and international standards and presumption of conformity: in the absence of harmonised standards, the Directive provides a solution for presumption of conformity with the web-accessibility requirements to the websites concerned which meet European standards or parts thereof that have been determined by the Commission by delegated acts. Mandate 376 is preparing a European Standard that includes web accessibility. In the absence of such European standard, the Directive also provides a solution for presumption of conformity with the web-accessibility requirements to the websites concerned which meet the parts of the ISO/IEC 40500:2012 covering the Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements for Level AA conformance. Reports: the accessibility of a website should be continuously monitored, in the light of regular updates of web content. Member States are requested to monitor the public sector bodies' websites concerned, using the methodology established by Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the budget of the Union. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains the provisions for the exercise of delegated acts in line with Article 290 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: differences in contract law between Member States and the additional transaction costs and complexity that they generate in cross-border transactions dissuade a considerable number of traders, in particular SME, from expanding into markets of other Member States. These differences also have the effect of limiting competition in the internal market. Currently, only one in ten traders in the Union exports goods within the Union and the majority of those who do, only export to a small number of Member States. The value of the trade foregone each year between Member States due to differences in contract law alone amounts to tens of billions of Euros. With its 2001 Communication on European contract law,  the Commission launched a process of extensive public consultation on the problems arising from differences between Member States' contract laws. In July 2010, the Commission launched a public consultation by publishing a 'Green Paper on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses', which set out different policy options on how to strengthen the internal market by making progress in the area of European contract law. In response to the Green Paper, the European Parliament issued a Resolution on 8 June 2011 in which it expressed its strong support for an instrument which would improve the establishment and the functioning of the internal market and bring benefits to traders, consumers and Member States' judicial systems. The Commission Communication 'Europe 2020' recognises the need to make it easier and less costly for traders and consumers to conclude contracts with partners in other Member States, notably by making progress towards an optional European contract law. The Digital Agenda for Europe envisages an optional instrument in European contract law to overcome the fragmentation of contract law and boost consumer confidence in e-commerce. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment analysed the seven policy options set out in the Green Paper. These options were: (1) the baseline scenario (no policy change); (2) a toolbox for the legislator; (3) a Recommendation on a Common European Sales Law; (4) a Regulation setting up an optional Common European Sales Law; (5) a Directive (full or minimum harmonisation) on a mandatory Common European Sales Law; (6i) a Regulation establishing a European contract law; (7) a Regulation establishing a European Civil Code. The establishment of an optional uniform contract law regime (Option 4) was therefore reasoned to be the most proportionate action as it would reduce transaction costs experienced by traders exporting to several Member States and give consumers more product choice at a lower price LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he Proposal provides for the establishment of a Common European Sales Law. It harmonises the national contract laws of the Member States not by requiring amendments to the pre-existing national contract law, but by creating within each Member State's national law a second contract law regime for contracts covered by its scope that is identical throughout the European Union and will exist alongside the pre-existing rules of national contract law. This ‘second regime’ is characterised by the following features: A contract law regime common to all Member States : the Common European Sales Law will be a 'second regime' of contract law that is identical in every Member State. It will be common for the whole of the EU. An optional regime : the choice of the Common European Sales Law will be voluntary. In line with the principle of freedom of contract, a trader is free to choose to offer a contract under this regime (opt-in system) or to remain with the existing national contract law. Focus on 'sales' contracts : the Common European Sales Law will introduce a self-standing and complete set of rules for sales transactions. This will in particular but not exclusively be useful for the online supply of goods. The Common European Sales Law could also be used, for example when buying music, films, software or applications that are downloaded from the internet. These products would be covered irrespective of whether they are stored on a tangible medium such as a CD or a DVD. Limited to cross-border contracts : the scope of the Common European Sales Law is focussed on cross-border situations where the problems of additional transactions costs and legal complexity arise. The Common European Sales Law is therefore targeted to where it is needed and is not available as a general substitute to existing national contract law. It is left to the discretion of Member States whether to give the regime a wider application. Member States thus have the choice to make the Common European Sales Law also available for domestic contracts – which could further reduce transaction costs for businesses active on the single market. Focus on B2C contracts and B2B contracts where at least one party is an SME : t he scope of the Common European Sales Law is focussed on aspects which pose real problems in cross-border transactions, i.e. business-to-consumer relations and business-to-business relations where at least one of the parties is an SME. Contracts concluded between private individuals (C2C) and contracts between traders where neither of the parties is an SME are not included. Identical set of consumer protection rules : the Regulation will establish for all the areas of contract law the same common level of consumer protection. A comprehensive set of contract law rules : t he Common European Sales Law includes rules that cover issues of contract law that are of practical relevance during the life-cycle of a cross-border contract. These issues fall within the areas of the rights and obligations of the parties and the remedies for non-performance, pre-contractual information duties, the conclusion of a contract (including formal requirements), the right of withdrawal and its consequences, avoidance resulting from a mistake, fraud or unfair exploitation, interpretation, the contents and effects of a contract, the assessment and consequences of unfairness of contract terms, restitution after avoidance and termination as well as prescription. It settles the sanctions available in case of the breach of the obligations and duties arising under its application. On the other hand, certain topics that are either very important for national laws or less relevant for cross-border contracts – such as rules on legal capacity, illegality/immorality or representation and the plurality of debtors and creditors – will not be addressed by the Common European Sales Law. These topics continue to be governed by the rules of the national law that is applicable under the Rome I Regulation. With an international dimension : the proposal also has an international vocation in that, in order to be applicable, it is sufficient that only one party is established in a Member State of the EU. This international vocation enables the Common European Sales Law to become a standard setter for international transactions in the area of sales contracts. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: after the adoption of the proposal, the Commission will set up a database for the exchange of information concerning final judgments referring to the Common European Sales Law or any other provision of the Regulation, as well as relevant judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The costs associated with this data-base are likely to grow as more final judgments become available. At the same time, the Commission will organise training sessions for legal practitioners using the Common European Sales Law. These costs are likely to decrease with time, as knowledge about how the Common European Sales Law works spreads."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: tobacco is the most significant cause of premature death in the EU, responsible for almost 700 000 deaths every year. More than ten years have passed since the adoption of the Directive 2001/37/EC on tobacco products. In line with market, scientific and international developments, it has become necessary to update and complement this Directive. The overall objective of the revision is to improve the functioning of the internal market. In particular, the proposal aims to: · update already harmonised areas, in order to overcome obstacles encountered by Member States in bringing their national legislation in line with new market, scientific and international developments; · address product related measures not yet covered by the Directive; · ensure that provisions of the Directive are not circumvented by the placing on the market of products not compliant with the Directive; · ensure a harmonised implementation of international obligations following from the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which is binding for the EU and all Member States. With regard to health protection, the proposed revision: · seeks to regulate tobacco products in a way that reflects their specific characteristics (nicotine has addictive properties) and the negative consequences of their consumption (mouth, throat and lung cancer, cardiovascular problems including heart attacks, strokes, clogged arteries, increased risk of blindness, impotence, lower fertility, impact on the unborn child etc); · focuses on initiation of tobacco consumption, in particular by young people, taking into account that 70% of the smokers start before the age of 18 and 94% before the age of 25; · create conditions which allow all citizens across the EU to take informed decisions about the products, based on accurate information on the health consequences of consuming tobacco products. The Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a Health for Growth Programme contains measures which have as their direct objective the protection of public health regarding tobacco products and advertisement required by or contributing to the objectives of EU legislation in this field. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment which accompanies the proposal. A high level of health protection has been taken as the basic criteria amongst the different strategic options that were considered during the review of the Directive. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT : the revision of Directive 2001/37/CE focuses on the following areas: 1) Ingredients and emissions : the maximum yields of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide as well as the measurement methods remain the same as in Directive 2001/37/EC. · keeps in place the mandatory reporting system of ingredients and, in addition, provides that a common electronic format for the reporting and manufacturers are required to provide supporting data (e.g. marketing reports); · provides that placing on the market of new or modified tobacco products must not take place before the submission of ingredients data. Reported data, excluding confidential information, must be published; · prohibits tobacco products with characterising flavours, such as fruit flavours or chocolate, and prohibits flavourings in filters, papers or packages; · forbids additives associated with energy and vitality (e.g. caffeine and taurine), or creating the impression that products have health benefits (e.g. vitamins); · exempts tobacco products other than cigarettes, roll-your own tobacco and smokeless tobacco products, i.e. cigars, cigarillos and pipe tobacco from some provisions such as the prohibition of products with characterising flavours. The exemption shall be removed if there is a substantial change of circumstances (in terms of sales volume or prevalence level among young people). 2) Labelling and packaging : the proposal seeks to ensure that the appearance of the package reflects the characteristics of the product inside the package - a product that has negative health consequences, is addictive, and is not for the consumption of children and teenagers. In concrete terms, the proposal: · provides that that combined warnings (picture plus text) of 75% should be displayed on both sides of the packages of tobacco products, presented in rotation; · replaces tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (TNCO) levels on the packages with an information message referring to harmful substances of tobacco; · ensures that display of cessation information (e.g. quit-lines, websites) is added to the packages; · states that neither packaging of tobacco products, nor the products themselves, shall include any elements that promote tobacco products or mislead consumers into believing that the product is less harmful than others, refers to flavours or tastes or resembles a food product; · exempts tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your own tobacco from larger health warnings; · provides that in order to increase the visibility of the health warnings on smokeless tobacco products, these will have to be put on both sides of the package according to the proposal, but their size will remain unchanged compared to Directive 2001/37. 3) Traceability and security features : the proposal: · provides for an EU tracking and tracing system at packet level for tobacco products throughout the supply chain (excluding retail). Tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own-tobacco are granted a transitional period of five years; · provides that technical standards to ensure compatibility between the tracking and tracing systems used as well as for the contracts with third parties shall be adopted by delegated acts. Technical standardisations for security features shall also be adopted through delegated acts. 4) Tobacco for oral use : the ban of placing on the market (including cross-border distance sale) of tobacco for oral use as set out in Directive 2001/37/EC is maintained (except for Sweden which has an exemption in its Accession Treaty). 5) Cross-border distance sales of tobacco products : cross-border distance sales of tobacco products fall outside the scope of Directive 2001/37/EC. The proposal: · includes a notification obligation for retailers of tobacco products intending to engage in cross-border distance sales; · allows Member States to require the retailer to appoint a natural person, who ensures compliance with the Directive of products delivered to customers in the Member States concerned; · provides a mandatory age verification mechanism. 6) Novel tobacco products (do not fall within any of the established product categories): these products will have to respect requirements of the Directive (e.g. in terms of labelling and ingredients) to ensure a level playing field, and the applicable rules will depend on whether the product involves a combustion process or not. The proposal also provides a notification obligation for novel tobacco products and the Commission will issue a report on market development in these products five years after the transposition deadline of the Directive. 7) Nicotine containing products (NCP): bearing in mind the novelty and the rapid growth of the market in NCP, the proposal removes current legislative divergence between Member States and the differential treatment between Nicotine Replacement Therapies and Nicotine Containing Products. The proposal provides that: · NCP that either have a nicotine level exceeding 2 mg, a nicotine concentration exceeding 4 mg per ml or whose intended use results in a mean maximum peak plasma concentration exceeding 4 ng per ml may be placed on the market only if they have been authorised as medicinal products on the basis of their quality, safety and efficacy, and with a positive risk/benefit balance; · NCP with nicotine levels below this threshold can be sold as consumer products provided they feature an adapted health warning. 8) Herbal products for smoking : herbal products for smoking fall outside the scope of Directive 2001/37/EC and Member States regulate these products in different ways. The proposal provides for adapted health warnings for herbal products for smoking to inform consumers about the adverse health effects of these products. In addition, no promotional or misleading elements are allowed on the packages. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the estimated impact on expenditure (operational appropriations, human resources and other administrative expenditure) amounts to EUR 7,888 millions for the period 2014-2018. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the so-called negative list (Annex I) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the so-called positive list (Annex II)). As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed and amended when appropriate. Third countries for which the situation has changed as regards these criteria, should be transferred from one Annex to the other. CONTENT: following successful negotiations between the EU and Moldova and taking into consideration the progress made by Moldova in its visa liberalisation dialogue during the last three years, the Commission proposes to transfer Moldova from the negative to the positive list, however with a limitation of this visa waiver to the holders of biometric passports issued by Moldova in line with standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the so-called negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the so-called positive list). The determination of those third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating inter alia to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the European Union's external relations with third countries or territories. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. In view of the criteria of public order and illegal immigration, particular attention should also be paid to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries or territories concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed at regular intervals. This review aims in particular to: · ensure that the composition of the lists of third countries complies with the criteria set out in Recital 5 of the Regulation, in particular the illegal immigration and public policy criteria and the transfer of countries from one annex to another as appropriate; · ensure that in accordance with Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU, the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country national is to be subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement. As a result, a new amended version of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 is proposed to add a certain number of States to the positive or negative list of the Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been carried out. LEGAL BASE: article 77, par. 2, point a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in line with the approach taken within the framework of previous amendments to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, it is proposed to: · transfer some countries onto the positive list : t he imposition of the visa requirement on the nationals of Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati , Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu and Vanuatu is no longer justified. These countries do not present any risk of illegal immigration or a threat to public policy for the Union in accordance with the criteria set out in recital 5 of Regulation (EC) N° 539/2001. Consequently, nationals of those countries should be exempt from the visa requirement for stays of no more than three months in all and references to those countries should be transferred to Annex II. Exemption from the visa requirement should not come into force until bilateral agreements on visa waiver between the Union and the countries concerned have been concluded in order to ensure full reciprocity. · transfer the groups of “ British nationals ” onto the positive list : statistical data show that the groups of British nationals currently listed in point 3 of Annex I do not pose a risk in terms of irregular migration to the Schengen Area and that most of them live in islands of the Caribbean region which have strong links and similarities with neighbouring countries which are exempt from the visa obligation. These groups of British nationals should therefore be exempt from the visa requirement for stays of no more than three months in all and references to those groups should be transferred to Annex II. · update the negative list (Annex I) by the inclusion of South Sudan: on 9 July 2011, South Sudan declared its independence from Sudan, which is on the negative list. On 14 July 2011, the country was granted membership of the United Nations. Annex I should therefore be amended so as to include South Sudan. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: “sustainable intensification"" and greening of food crop production, in which yields are increased without adverse environmental impact and without the cultivation of more land, have become a central concern. Plant reproductive material legislation is critically important for reaching this aim. The EU Forest Strategy emphasises the importance of the multifunctional role of forest and its sustainable management. The majority of Council Directives for making available on the market of plant reproductive material have first been adopted between 1966 and 1971 and some Directives are more recent. The complexity and fragmentation of the existing legislation is likely to perpetuate existing uncertainties and discrepancies in its implementation between the Member States. This creates an uneven playing field for professional operators on the single market. Developments in the areas of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, plant breeding and making available on the market of plant reproductive material have shown that the legislation needs to be simplified and further adapted to the developments of the sector by replacing the existing Directives by a single Regulation. This proposal is part of a comprehensive package that also includes three other proposals to modernise the plant health, animal health, and official controls acquis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that no single option succeeds in achieving the objectives of the review of the current system. The preferred option combines aspects that seek to strike a balance between flexibility for professional operators (Options 2 and 4), biodiversity (Option 4) and the necessary rigour in health and quality requirements (Options 2 and 5) for the fair functioning of the market and for maintaining the quality and health of plant reproductive material. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal consolidates and updates legislation on the placing on the market of plant reproductive material by repealing and replacing the 12 existing directives. Its main features may be summarised as follows: Objectives: the proposal seeks to: (i) ensure a level playing field across the EU through simplified, clarified and harmonised rules; (ii) reduce unnecessary costs and administrative burden and to increase flexibility; (iii) align PRM legislation with other recent Union strategies; and (iv) foster innovation in plant breeding. The scope of the proposed Regulation covers all forms of PRM. Professional operators: the proposal introduces basic obligations for professional operators concerning the identification of the plant reproductive material they are producing or making available on the market, keeping of records, facilitation of controls and maintenance of the material. The traceability of any plant reproductive material is ensured by the obligation for the professional operators to have information one step before and one step after their commercial activities. PRM other than forest reproductive material: the proposal maintains the basic approach on registration of varieties/material and certification/inspection of lots before making available on the market. However, more flexibility will be given to professional operators. In addition, secondary acts will be adopted setting out the specific requirements for the production and making available on the market of particular species and their categories (pre-basic, basic, certified and standard material). The proposal sets down the requirements for making available on the market of PRM. It retains certain derogations and introduces a derogation on niche market plant reproductive material. It also brings exports within the scope of the Regulation. Production and making available on the market of PRM belonging to non-listed genera or species: PRM not belonging to the listed genera and species shall also be subject to a few basic requirements with regard to its health status, fitness for purpose, appropriate reference to varieties, where applicable, and identification of the respective material and imports. Registration of varieties in national and Union registers: the varieties, in order to be made available on the market throughout the Union, shall be included in a national register or in the Union register via direct application procedure to the CVPO. CPVO will keep the updated information on all plant varieties that can be made available on the market in the Union, including the varieties registered in national registers (Union plant variety database). The proposal establishes the detailed requirements for the variety registration Procedure. A new obligation for each national variety examination centre to be audited by the CPVO will be introduced with the aim to ensure the quality and harmonisation of the variety registration process in the Union. Concerning old varieties, less stringent requirements should continue to be laid down. Production and making available on the market of forest reproductive material: the EU legislation sets a specific approach on forest reproductive material. The proposal establishes the requirements applicable to forest reproductive material. Derogations are envisaged in regard to: (i) authorisation of more stringent national requirements; (ii) prohibition to make available to end-user specified forest reproductive material; and (iii) rules concerning temporary difficulties in supply and rules concerning temporary experiments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial appropriations for implementing the Regulation up to 31 December 2020 are presented in the Regulation on laying down provisions for the management of expenditure relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare, and relating to plant health and plant reproductive material. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal includes provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to comply with the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-63/12, when the Council establishes that at this stage of the procedure there is a serious and sudden deterioration in the economic and social situation within the Union, the Commission must submit a Proposal under Article 336 in order to involve the European Parliament in the legislative process. Equally the Council and the European Parliament shall decide upon the Commission proposal having regard to the criteria set in Article 65 of the Staff Regulations respecting the rules set in Annex XI with the exception of its Article 3(2). The Court has confirmed that the Commission has a margin of appraisal that should be based on Article 65 of the Staff Regulations, as regards the content of appropriate proposals. The review of remuneration may, where appropriate, take into account other factors, such as the human resources management and in particular the needs of recruitment. Within this margin of appraisal, the Commission may base its decision upon economic and social data such as the 2011 stagnation and the ongoing crisis as well as the high level of unemployment rate and the high level of public deficit and debt in the European Union. The Commission has taken into account as well developments since 2011 such as the reform of the Staff Regulations and especially the two years freeze imposed to EU officials and the increase of weekly working time to 40 hours. According to the data supplied by Eurostat in agreement with the national statistical offices of the Member States, national civil servants lost 1.8% of their purchasing power, the same loss in purchasing power should have been applied to the EU officials and other servants for the period 1 July 2011 – 30 June 2012 if the Commission would have followed the normal application of the method. The Commission considered however as appropriate to reduce the proposed adjustment to remuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg to 0.9% instead of 1.7% with regard to the economic crisis and the efforts already consented by EU officials. The same approach would lead in 2012 to an adjustment of 0.9% instead of 1.7%. The total adjustment for both years would be therefore 47% lower than under the normal application of the method in force in 2011 and 2012. The Commission has proposed the above measures in order to involve the European Parliament in the legislative procedure and to allow the co-legislators to decide on the appropriate measures in accordance with Article 336 TFEU. Under Article 65 of the Staff Regulations the remuneration and pensions shall be updated before the end of each year, which is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: under this proposal, with effect from 1 July 2011, the table of basic monthly salaries applicable for the purposes of calculating remuneration and pensions shall be replaced by the proposed amendments in this proposal. The correction coefficients are also laid down in the proposal with the amended dates as regards: parental leave benefits, household allowance, dependent child allowance, education allowance, expatriation allowance, other types of compensation or unemployment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has a financial impact on all budgetary lines relating to staff expenditure in all Institutions and Agencies, i.e. it concerns expenditure for salaries of staff in headquarters and in delegations, contract agents, staff in the administrative offices, Members, parliamentary assistants, research staff, staff financed under BA-lines, staff paid under the provisions of early termination of service, pensions. In 2013, the budgetary impact of this change would be EUR 129 million and EUR 51.6 million/year in 2014 and subsequent years."

BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision. President Barroso therefore requested a group of high level experts, chaired by Jacques de Larosière, to make proposals to strengthen European supervisory arrangements. Building on its recommendations, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009. The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 which proposed: establishing a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs): a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA); and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor and assess potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. The Communication also concluded that in order for the ESFS to work effectively, changes to the financial services legislation would be necessary, in particular to provide an appropriate scope to the more general powers provided for in the individual regulations establishing the authorities, ensuring a more harmonised set of financial rules through the possibility to develop draft technical standards and facilitate the sharing, where necessary, of microprudential information. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanied the legislative proposals, examining the options in more detail. The second impact assessment analysed the options for the appropriate powers for the authorities to work towards achieving a single set of harmonised rules and concluded that this capacity would be rightly limited to those areas to be defined in forthcoming sectoral legislation, and identified such potential areas. Additionally, in developing the draft technical standards themselves, the authorities should undertake appropriate analysis of potential related costs and benefits and consult stakeholders before submitting them to the Commission. LEGAL BASIS: given that changes need to be introduced into existing Directives to ensure the development of a single rule book, an amending Directive is the most appropriate instrument. This amending Directive should have the same legal basis as the Directives it amends, i.e. Articles 50, 53, 62, and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: along with the Regulations establishing the EBA, EIOPA and ESMA and in order for the ESFS to work effectively, changes to the sectoral legislation are necessary. The areas in which amendments are proposed fall broadly into the following categories: definition of the appropriate scope of technical standards as an additional tool for supervisory convergence and with a view of developing a single rule book; to appropriately integrate the possibility for the authorities to settle disagreements in a balanced way to those areas where common decision making processes already exist in sectoral legislation; general amendments which are common to most sectoral legislation and necessary for the directives to operate in the context of new authorities, for example, renaming the level 3 committees to the new authorities and ensuring the appropriate gateways for the exchange of information are present; and additional amendments to the Solvency II Directive. This amending directive is proposed to amend the following legislation: i) Directive 2003/71/EC: Prospectus Directive and ii) Directive 2009/138/EC (the Solvency II Directive). The changes to be made to the Solvency II Directive aim to: to adjust existing level 2 empowerments to the Lisbon Treaty: existing level 2 empowerments should be transformed into empowerments for delegated acts. Appropriate control procedures should be foreseen; provide for transitional requirements in relation to valuation, governance, supervisory reporting and public disclosure, the determination and classification of own funds, the standard formula for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement and the choice of methods and assumptions for the calculation of technical provisions, including the determination of the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure. It is also necessary to enable level 2 measures to specify transitional arrangements in relation to the treatment of third country regimes. The transitional requirements should not result in more favourable treatment for insurance and reinsurance undertakings, or lower protection for policy holders. They should encourage undertakings to move towards compliance with the particular requirements of the new regime as soon as possible; amend level 2 empowerments: in order to allow for greater convergence on procedures for supervisory approvals already provided for in Solvency II (specific parameters, model change policies, special purpose vehicles and the setting and removal of capital add-ons), the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures by means of delegated acts specifying procedure in these areas; include the European Cooperative Society (SCE) in the list of permissible forms of insurance and reinsurance undertakings; introduce an amendment to reflect the adaptation to the Euro amount of the MCR floor for captive reinsurance undertakings; Extend by two months the implementation date in order to better align the start of the various new reporting, calculation and other obligations of the Solvency II regime with the date (31 December) which marks the end of the financial year of the majority of insurance undertakings. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no implication for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (revision of Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 on transfer of funds). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Funds Transfers Regulation, based on Special Recommendation VII on wire transfers adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), lays down rules for payment service providers to send information on the payer throughout the payment chain for the purposes of prevention, investigation and detection of money laundering and terrorist financing. Against a background of the changes regarding the nature of money laundering and terrorist financing threats, facilitated by a constant evolution of technology and means at the disposal of criminals, the FATF has undertaken a fundamental review of the international standards, which culminated in the adoption of a new set of Recommendations in February 2012. In parallel with this process, the European Commission has also been undertaking its own review of the EU framework, which demonstrates the need to ensure adjustment to changes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identifies the main problems in the current EU anti-money laundering/combating terrorist financing legislative framework. It examines three scenarios: (i) a base-line scenario (status quo); (ii) an adjustment scenario; and (iii) a full harmonisation scenario. The analysis has demonstrated that the most balanced is the adjustment scenario which entails limited changes to the Funds Transfers Regulation necessary to either (i) align the legislative text to the revised international standards, or (ii) to ensure a sufficient level of consistency between national rules, or (iii) to address the most important shortcomings concerning the new emerging threats. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to revise Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds in ways which improve traceability of payments and ensure that the EU framework remains fully compliant with international standards. In line with new FATF Recommendation No 16 on wire transfers, the proposed changes are aimed at addressing areas where gaps in transparency still remain by imposing the following main requirements: · include information on the payee (the name and account number of the payer, where such an account is used to process the transfer of funds, or a unique transaction identifier where no such account is used for that purpose; · clarify that credit or debit cards, or mobile telephone or any other digital or IT device become subject to the provisions of the Regulation if they are used to transfer funds person to person; · clarify that, in the case of fund transfers outside the EU of a sum below EUR 1 000, a lighter regime of non-verified information on the payer and the payee applies; · impose a requirement to verify the identity of the beneficiary (where not previously identified) for payments originating outside the EU and where the amount is more than EUR 1 000; · impose an obligation to establish risk-based procedures for determining when to execute, reject or suspend a transfer of funds which lacks the required information and to determine appropriate follow-up action; · align the requirements on record keeping with the information with the FATF standards; · reinforce sanctioning powers for competent authorities and require coordination of actions when dealing with cross-border cases; · require publication of sanctions imposed for breaches and the establishment of effective mechanisms to encourage reporting of breaches of the provisions of the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE : Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: Money laundering and terrorism financing create thus a high risk to the integrity, proper functioning, reputation and stability of the financial system. The changing nature of money laundering and terrorist financing threats requires a permanent adaptation of the legal framework to counter such threats. At EU level, Directive 2005/60/EC (the Third Anti Money Laundering Directive or AMLD) sets out the framework designed to protect financial institutions against the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. The EU rules are to a large extent based on international standards adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). At international level, the FATF has undertaken a fundamental review of international standards and adopted a new set of Recommendations in February 2012. In parallel to the international process, the European Commission has been undertaking its own review of the European framework. The proposed revision of the Directive is complementary to the revised FATF Recommendations, which represent a substantial strengthening of the anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment, where it analysed the potential consequences of money laundering and terrorism financing. It also analysed the impact of the legislative proposals on fundamental rights. In order to rectify the problems identified, the assessment concluded that the following operational objectives must be achieved: ensure consistency between national rules and, where appropriate, flexibility in their implementation by strengthening and clarifying current requirements; ensure that the rules are risk-focused and adjusted to address new emerging threats, by strengthening and clarifying current requirements; ensure that the EU approach is consistent with the approach followed at international level by extending the scope of application, and strengthening and clarifying the current requirements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal incorporates and repeals Commission Directive 2006/70/EC laying down implementing measures for Directive 2005/60/EC1, thus improving the comprehensibility and accessibility of the anti-money laundering legislative framework. The Commission proposes to make the following amendments to the Third Anti-Money Laundering Directive: broaden the scope of the Directive beyond casinos to cover the gambling services involving wagering a stake with monetary value in games of chance; include an explicit reference to tax crimes as a predicate offence; reduce the scope of the Directive and customer due diligence thresholds for traders in high value goods from EUR 15 000 to EUR 7 500 for cash transactions; introduce a requirement for Member States to carry out a risk assessment at national level and take measures to mitigate risks; Member States are required to ensure that enhanced due diligence must be conducted in certain situations of high risk, while allowing them to permit simplified due diligence in lower risk situations; require all companies to hold information on their beneficial owners; maintain the approach which requires identification of the beneficial owner from a 25% ownership threshold, but clarify what the ""25% threshold"" refers to; introduce new rules clarifying that branches and subsidiaries situated in Member States other than the head office must apply host state anti-money laundering rules and reinforce cooperation arrangements between home and host supervisors; remove the provisions relating to positive ""equivalence "" with third countries, as the use of exemptions on the grounds of purely geographical factors is less relevant; provide a range of sanctions that Member States should ensure are available for systematic breaches of key requirements of the Directive; bring in the provisions of Council Decision 2000/642/JHA concerning arrangements for cooperation between financial intelligence units of Member States in respect of exchanging information and also extend and strengthen cooperation; entrust certain tasks to the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA): (i) carry out an assessment and provide an opinion on money laundering and terrorist financing risks; (ii) produce guidance for financial institutions on what factors should be taken into account when applying simplified customer due diligence and enhanced customer due diligence and when applying a risk-based approach to supervision; introduce provisions to clarify the interaction between anti-money laundering/combating terrorist financing and data protection requirements; introduce new requirements for the treatment of domestic politically exposed persons (PEPs) and PEPs working in international organisations.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: before a vehicle may be put on the market, it has to fulfil all the relevant type or individual approval requirements guaranteeing an optimal level of safety and environmental standards. Following this approval, cars on the road have to be regularly submitted to periodic roadworthiness tests. The goal of roadworthiness testing is to check the functionality of safety components, the environmental performance and the compliance of a vehicle with its approval. The proposal aims at contributing to reach the target of a reduction of road fatalities by half until 2020 as laid down in the Policy Orientations on Road Safety 2011-2020. It will also contribute to the reduction of emissions in road transport linked to poor maintenance of vehicles, following the European Strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles as well as the integrated energy and climate change policy. The proposal is part of a package of measures which also includes: a proposal for a regulation on technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Union and repealing Directive 2000/30/EC and a proposal for a regulation on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the following options were considered: Option 1: the 'No policy change' approach where the present EU legal framework would be maintained; Option 2: the ""Soft law approach"" would consist in both better implementation and better monitoring of the application of existing legislation; Option 3: the ""Legislative approach"" would be based on two components: (a) revising upwards the minimum EU standards for periodic roadworthiness tests (PTI) and unexpected roadside inspections (RSI) and define mandatory standards; (b) in a second phase, the possible establishment of and EU harmonised data exchange system linking the existing databases. The impact assessment has shown the benefits of a combination of a soft-law approach with a regulatory approach. Therefore, the soft-law measures have been integrated into the legislative texts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal will amend the existing requirements laid down in the existing legislative framework related to the registration documents for vehicles (Directive 1999/37/EC). It aims at improving the enforcement of the roadworthiness testing and roadside inspection regime, notably in the case where the technical condition of a vehicle creates an imminent risk to road safety. Compared to the existing act, the proposal provides for more precise definitions on the place of registration of vehicles, withdrawal and cancellation of registrations. The proposal also lays down new requirements on electronic vehicle registration registers and the follow up of notifications related to roadworthiness test results, re-registration and destruction of vehicles. Withdrawal and cancellation of registrations : the proposal: notified as 'end of life vehicle' shall be cancelled following its notification. Electronic registers: the proposal also introduces the establishment of electronic registers containing all information related to the vehicle registration. This information will be made accessible for the purpose of roadworthiness testing as only a part of this information is printed on the registration certificates. The register provides for follow-up after notification of roadworthiness test results, re-registration and destruction of a vehicle. Commission’s powers: the Commission shall be empowered to update the annexes taking into account the evolution of the EU type-approval legislation in relation with the content of certificates of conformity as well as technical progress via delegated acts. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: before a vehicle may be put on the market, it has to fulfil all the relevant type or individual approval requirements guaranteeing an optimal level of safety and environmental standards. Following this approval, cars on the road have to be regularly submitted to periodic roadworthiness tests. The goal of roadworthiness testing is to check the functionality of safety components, the environmental performance and the compliance of a vehicle with its approval. The proposal aims at contributing to reach the target of a reduction of road fatalities by half until 2020 as laid down in the Policy Orientations on Road Safety 2011-2020. It will also contribute to the reduction of emissions in road transport linked to poor maintenance of vehicles, following the European Strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles as well as the integrated energy and climate change policy. The proposal is part of a package of measures which also includes: a proposal on the amendment of Directive 1999/37/EC on registration documents for vehicles and a proposal for a regulation on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the following options were considered: Option 1: the 'No policy change' approach where the present EU legal framework would be maintained; Option 2: the ""Soft law approach"" would consist in both better implementation and better monitoring of the application of existing legislation; Option 3: the ""Legislative approach"" would be based on two components: (a) revising upwards the minimum EU standards for periodic roadworthiness tests (PTI) and unexpected roadside inspections (RSI) and define mandatory standards; (b) in a second phase, the possible establishment of and EU harmonised data exchange system linking the existing databases. The impact assessment has shown the benefits of a combination of a soft-law approach with a regulatory approach. Therefore, the soft-law measures have been integrated into the legislative texts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the ""Roadworthiness Package"" will carry over the existing requirements laid down in the existing legislative framework related to the roadworthiness regime, which covers roadworthiness tests (Directive 2009/40/EC), roadside inspections (Directive 2000/30/EC) and rules on the registration of vehicles (Directive 1999/37/EC). The main objective of the proposal is to provide for a risk-rating system aimed at focusing inspections on vehicles operated by undertaking with poor safety records, thus rewarding vehicles operated by undertakings that are mindful of safety and the environment. The main points of the proposal are as follows: Scope : light commercial vehicles and their trailers will be included into the scope of roadside test activities as this group of vehicles does not follow the downward trend in road fatalities. Roadside inspections : to distribute better the roadside inspections by Member States a percentage of the number of registered commercial vehicles shall be inspected every year. The total percentage will not exceed the number of roadworthiness tests already performed in the Union. The selection of vehicles shall be based on the risk profile of the operators and target high risk undertakings to reduce the burden on the operators that maintain their vehicles in a proper way. Company profiling shall be based on the results of previous roadworthiness tests and roadside inspections similar. More elaborated roadside inspections shall be performed using testing equipment either by mobile inspection units or at test centres in close vicinity. The securing of cargo should be included in the roadside checks. Deficiencies detected shall be assessed according to harmonised rules related to their risk. Training and qualifications : the level of knowledge and skills of inspectors performing roadside inspectors shall meet at least the level of those conducting roadworthiness tests. National contact points : cooperation and exchange of information between Member States and with the Commission will be performed more efficiently via designated points of contact in the Member States. Commission’s powers : the Commission shall be empowered to update the annexes to technical progress via delegated acts and to maintain the certificates and reporting forms in close cooperation with Member States via implementing acts including inter alia alternative test procedures based upon modern emission after-treatment systems for checking the in use NOx and particulate emissions conformity which are still under development. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Eurostat’s rail transport statistics are predominantly based on Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1192/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 332/2007. These Regulations cover passenger and freight transport by rail, as well as rail safety. The Commission needs statistics on the transport of goods and passengers by rail in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy. Detailed rail transport statistics for goods and passengers and information on intermodality are necessary to monitor the targets set in the 2011 Commission’s White Paper. Eurostat has conducted a technical analysis of the existing data on rail statistics collected under the Union legislation and of the dissemination policy, within its Working Group and Task Force on rail transport statistics. In its report to the European Parliament and the Council on the experience acquired in the application of the Regulation (EC) No 91/2003, the Commission mentions that long term developments will probably mean the suppression or simplification of the data already collected under the Regulation, and that the intention is to reduce the data transmission period for annual data on rail passengers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal is the result of in-depth negotiations between all interested parties. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is thus to modify Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 in order to update, simplify and optimise the existing legal framework for European statistics on rail transport and to align it with the new institutional context. Data on transport of passengers : in line with Annexes C and D to Regulation (EC) 91/2003 on rail transport statistics, countries are currently required to provide annual statistics on passenger transport, under detailed and/or simplified reporting. The Commission proposed to delete Annex D (simplified reporting) and the provisional Tables C1 and C2 in Annex C, while shortening the deadline for providing the final passenger data from 14 months to eight months after the end of the reference period. Data on transport of goods : in the interests of consistency, it is also proposed to delete Annex B (simplified reporting). New Annex : as it is proposed to abandon the current concept of ‘simplified’ reporting, for the smallest undertakings below the specified thresholds, Member States would have to report a ‘total’ figure for aggregated indicators in Annex L. Data on accidents : as data on accidents are also collected by the European Rail Agency, it is proposed to delete Annex H (statistics on accidents). Annex I : as the concept of ‘simplified’ reporting will disappear, it is proposed to delete this Annex as it is currently used only to validate coverage between simplified and detailed reporting in relation to the total rail activity of undertakings. Thresholds : the present thresholds are established for tonne-km and passenger-km, i.e. multiplication of tonnes/passengers transported and the distance covered in kilometres. As significant rail activity involves only small distances in some Member States, it is proposed to decrease the thresholds both for goods and passengers, in order to minimise the loss of important data. For the same reason, a double threshold in tonnes transported and in tonne-km is proposed for goods. Transit data : it is proposed that ‘Rail Waybill’ information (if available) be used when administrative data are used as the data source. Lastly, the proposed amendment of Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 takes into account the necessary adjustments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards granting the Commission delegated and implementing powers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products and Council Regulation (EC) No 614/2009 on the common system of trade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin15 need to be adapted as a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in particular as regards its introduction of a distinction between powers for the Commission to adopt delegated acts and powers for it to adopt implementing acts. Further adaptations are needed to improve the clarity and transparency of the existing texts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there is no need for an impact assessment since the proposal to align Regulation No 1216/2009 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter of relevance to all Council Regulations and the alignment to the new Single CMO Regulation is a consequence of the new CAP after 2013 and the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposed Regulation (EU) of the Council and of the Parliament replacing the trade arrangements for Processed Agricultural Products/non-Annex I goods, currently laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products is: to identify, in Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009, the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission and establish the corresponding procedure for the adoption of these acts and this in parallel with the Lisbon alignment of the single Common Market Organisation; to adapt Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 to the new Single CMO Regulation in the context of the CAP after 2013 and the new MFF 2014-2020; to integrate the common system of trade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin (Regulation (EC) No 614/2009) in the trade regime for processed agricultural products (Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009). Ovalbumin and lactalbumin are processed agricultural products which are not included in Annex I to the Treaty. In view of the fact that to a large extent, eggs can be substituted by ovalbumin and, to a certain extent, by lactalbumin, the trade arrangements for ovalbumin and lactalbumin should correspond to those established for eggs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member States. It was complemented by Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA as a general instrument at Union level for the protection of personal data in the areas of police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. The current legal framework remains sound as far as its objectives and principles are concerned, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the way personal data protection is implemented across the Union, legal uncertainty and a widespread public perception that there are significant risks associated notably with online activity. This is why it is time to build a stronger and more coherent data protection framework in the EU, backed by strong enforcement that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Personal data protection therefore plays a central role in the Digital Agenda for Europe, and more generally in the Europe 2020 Strategy. Article 16(1) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) , as introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, establishes the principle that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In 2010, the European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative initiatives. The Commission stressed in its Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme the need to ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is consistently applied in the context of all EU policies. In its Communication on “ A comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union ”, the Commission concluded that the EU needs a more comprehensive and coherent policy on the fundamental right to personal data protection. The European Parliament approved by its resolution of 6 July 2011 a report that supported the Commission’s approach to reforming the data protection framework. This proposal further details the approach for the new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the EU as presented in its Communication on this issue. The legal framework consists of two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of improving the internal market dimension of data protection, making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence, including police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Three policy options of different degrees of intervention were assessed: Option 1 : this option consisted of minimal legislative amendments and the use of interpretative Communications and policy support measures such as funding programmes and technical tools; Option 2 : this option comprised a set of legislative provisions addressing each of the issues identified in the analysis and Option 3 : this option was the centralisation of data protection at EU level through precise and detailed rules for all sectors and the establishment of an EU agency for monitoring and enforcement of the provisions. The analysis of the overall impact led to the development of the preferred policy option which is based on the second option with some elements from the other two options and incorporated in the present proposal. According to the impact assessment, its implementation will lead inter alia to considerable improvements regarding legal certainty for data controllers and citizens, reduction of administrative burden, consistency of data protection enforcement in the Union, the effective possibility of individuals to exercise their data protection rights to the protection of personal data within the EU and the efficiency of data protection supervision and enforcement. LEGAL BASIS: Article 16(2) and Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. It protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. It main provisions are as follows: Principles : the proposal sets out the principles relating to personal data processing. Additional new elements are in particular the transparency principle, the clarification of the data minimisation principle and the establishment of a comprehensive responsibility and liability of the controller. It also sets out the criteria for lawful processing, which are further specified as regards the balance of interest criterion, and the compliance with legal obligations and public interest. It clarifies the conditions for consent to be valid as a legal ground for lawful processing and sets out further conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data of children in relation to information society services offered directly to them. Rights of the data subject : the proposal introduces the obligation on controllers to provide transparent and easily accessible and understandable information. It obliges the controller to provide procedures and mechanism for exercising the data subject's rights, including means for electronic requests, requiring response to the data subject's request within a defined deadline, and the motivation of refusals. In addition, the proposal: further specifies the controller's information obligations towards the data subject, providing additional information to the data subject, including on the storage period, the right to lodge a complaint, in relation to international transfers and to the source from which the data are originating; provides the data subject's right of access to their personal data, such as to inform the data subjects of the storage period, and of the rights to rectification and to erasure and to lodge a complaint; sets out the data subject's right to rectification; provides the data subject's right to be forgotten and to erasure. It further elaborates and specifies the right of erasure provided for in Article 12(b) of Directive 95/46/EC; introduces the data subject's right to data portability, i.e. to transfer data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the controller. As a precondition and in order to further improve access of individuals to their personal data, it provides the right to obtain from the controller those data in a structured and commonly used electronic format; provides for the data subject's rights to object; concerns the data subject's right not to be subject to a measure based on profiling. General obligations : the proposal takes account of the debate on a ""principle of accountability"" and describes in detail the obligation of responsibility of the controller to comply with this Regulation and to demonstrate this compliance, including by way of adoption of internal policies and mechanisms for ensuring such compliance. It sets out the obligations of the controller arising from the principles of data protection by design and by default. It introduces for controllers and processors: (i) the obligation for controllers and processors to maintain documentation of the processing operations under their responsibility, instead of a general notification to the supervisory authority; (ii) the obligation to implement appropriate measures for the security of processing; (iii) an obligation to notify personal data breaches; (iv) the obligation of controllers and processors to carry out a data protection impact assessment prior to risky processing operations. Data protection officer : the proposal introduces a mandatory data protection officer for the public sector, and, in the private sector, for large enterprises or where the core activities of the controller or processor consist of processing operations which require regular and systematic monitoring. Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations : the proposal spells out, as a general principle, that the compliance with the obligations in that chapter are mandatory for any transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations, including onward transfers. It sets out the criteria, conditions and procedures for the adoption of an adequacy decision by the Commission. The criteria which shall be taken into account for the Commission’s assessment of an adequate or not adequate level of protection include expressly the rule of law, judicial redress and independent supervision. The proposal requires for transfers to third countries, where no adequacy decision has been adopted by the Commission, to adduce appropriate safeguards, in particular standard data protection clauses, binding corporate rules and contractual clauses. Independent supervisory authorities : the proposal obliges Member States to establish supervisory authorities and to enlarge the mission of the supervisory authorities to co-operation with each other and with the Commission. It clarifies the conditions for the independence of supervisory authorities, implementing case law by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Co-operation and consistency : the proposal introduces explicit rules on mandatory mutual assistance, including consequences for non-compliance with the request of another supervisory authority. It introduces a consistency mechanism for ensuring unity of application in relation to processing operations which may concern data subjects in several Member States. The proposal also establishes the European Data Protection Board, consisting of the heads of the supervisory authority of each Member State and of the European Data Protection Supervisor. The European Data Protection Board replaces the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data set up under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC. Remedies, liability and sanctions : the proposal provides: (i) for the right of any data subject to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (ii) that the bodies, organisations or associations which may lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject and also in case of a personal data breach independently of a data subject's complaint; (iii) for the right to a judicial remedy against a supervisory authority; (iv) the data subject may launch a court action for obliging the supervisory authority to act on a complaint; (v) the right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor; (vi) for the introduction of common rules for court proceedings, including the rights of bodies, organisations or associations to represent data subjects before the courts, and the right of supervisory authorities to engage in legal proceedings; (vii) for the Member States to provide for the right to compensation and lay down rules on penalties, to sanction infringements of the Directive, and to ensure their implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Data Protection Supervisor as specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. These implications require reprogramming of Heading 5 of the Financial Perspective. The total appropriations are estimated at EUR 24.339 million for 2014-2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member States. It was complemented by several instruments providing specific data protection rules in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (ex-third pillar), including Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA has a limited scope of application , since it only applies to cross-border data processing and not to processing activities by the police and judiciary authorities at purely national level. The Framework Decision leaves a large room for manoeuvre to Member States' national laws in implementing its provisions. Additionally, it does not contain any mechanism or advisory group similar to the Article 29 Working Party supporting common interpretation of its provisions, nor foresees any implementing powers for the Commission to ensure a common approach in its implementation. Due to the specific nature of the field of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, it was acknowledged in Declaration 21 (annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon) that specific rules on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data in the fields of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation based on Article 16 TFEU may prove necessary. In 2010, the European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative initiatives. In its resolution on the Stockholm Programme , the European Parliament welcomed a comprehensive data protection scheme in the EU and among others called for the revision of the Framework Decision. The Commission stressed in its Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme the need to ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is consistently applied in the context of all EU policies. In its Communication on “ A comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union ”, the Commission concluded that the EU needs a more comprehensive and coherent policy on the fundamental right to personal data protection. This proposal further details the approach for the new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the EU as presented in its Communication on this issue. The legal framework consists of two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and this proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of: (i) improving the internal market dimension of data protection, (ii) making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and, (iii) creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence, including police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. As regards this latter objective in particular, two policy options were assessed: a first one basically extending the scope of data protection rules in this area and addressing the gaps and other issues raised by the Framework Decision, and a second more far-reaching one with very prescriptive and stringent rules, which would also entail the immediate amendment of all other ""former third pillar"" instruments. A third ""minimalistic"" option based largely on interpretative Communications and policy support measures, such as funding programmes and technical tools, with minimum legislative intervention, was not considered appropriate to address the issues identified in this area in relation to data protection. The analysis of the overall impact led to the development of the preferred policy option which is incorporated in the present proposal. According to the assessment, its implementation will lead to further strengthening data protection in this policy area in particular by including domestic data processing, thereby also enhancing legal certainty for competent authorities in the areas of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 16(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive repeals Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. It defines the rules relating to processing of personal data for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal offences, and sets out the Directive's two-fold objective, i.e. to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of public safety, and to ensure the exchange of personal data between competent authorities within the Union. It defines the scope of application of the Directive. The scope of the Directive is not limited to cross-border data processing but applies to all processing activities carried out by 'competent authorities' as defined in the Directive. Principles : the proposal sets out the principles relating to processing of personal data and requires the distinction, as far as possible; between personal data of different categories of data subjects. It sets out the grounds for lawful processing, when necessary for the performance of a task carried out by a competent authority based on national law, to comply with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person or to prevent an immediate and serious threat to public security. The proposed Directive sets out a general prohibition of processing special categories of personal data and the exceptions from this general rule. It establishes a prohibition of measures based solely on automated processing of personal data if not authorised by law providing appropriate safeguards. Rights of the data subject : the proposal introduces the obligation for Member States to ensure easily accessible and understandable information, and to oblige controllers to provide procedures and mechanisms for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights. This includes the requirement that the exercise of the rights shall be in principle free of charge. It specifies the obligation for Member States to ensure the information towards the data subject. It also provides the obligation for Member States to ensure the data subject's right of access to their personal data. The proposal provides that Member States may adopt legislative measures restricting the right of access if required by the specific nature of data processing in the areas of police and criminal justice, and on the information of the data subject on a restriction of access. Provisions on the rectification, erasure and restriction of processing in judicial proceedings provide clarification based on Article 4(4) of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Controller and processor : the proposal sets out that the Member States must ensure the compliance of the controller with the obligations arising from the principles of data protection by design and by default. It clarifies the position and obligation of processors, and adds new elements, including that a processor that processes data beyond the controller's instructions is to be considered a co-controller. It introduces the obligation for controllers and processors to maintain documentation of all processing systems and procedures under their responsibility. Data security : the Article on the security of processing is based on the current Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46 on the security of processing, and Article 22 of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, extending the related obligations to processors, irrespective of their contract with the controller. The proposal introduces an obligation to notify personal data breaches, inspired by the personal data breach notification, clarifying and separating the obligations to notify the supervisory authority and to communicate, in qualified circumstances, to the data subject. It also provides for exemptions on reasons set out in the Directive. Data Protection Officer : the proposal introduces an obligation for the controller to appoint a mandatory data protection officer who should fulfil the tasks listed in the Directive. Where several competent authorities are acting under the supervision of a central authority, functioning as controller, at least this central authority should designate such a data protection officer. Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations : transfers to third countries may take place only if the transfer is necessary for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. The proposal lays down that transfers to a third country may take place in relation to which the Commission has adopted an adequacy decision of the level of protection or, in the absence of such decisions, where appropriate safeguards are in place. It furthermore sets out the criteria for the Commission’s assessment of an adequate or not adequate level of protection, and expressly includes the rule of law, judicial redress and independent supervision. It also provides for the possibility for the Commission to assess the level of protection afforded by a territory or a processing sector within a third country. In addition, the proposed Directive: defines the appropriate safeguards needed prior to international transfers, in the absence of a Commission adequacy decision. These safeguards may be adduced by a legally binding instrument such as an international agreement. Alternatively, the data controller may on the basis of an assessment of the circumstances surrounding the transfer conclude that they exist; spells out the derogations for data transfer; obliges Member States to provide that the controller informs the recipient of any processing restrictions and takes all reasonable steps to ensure that these restrictions are met by recipients of the personal data in the third country or international organisation; explicitly provides for international co-operation mechanisms for the protection of personal data between the Commission and the supervisory authorities of third countries. Independent national supervisory authorities : the proposal obliges Member States to establish supervisory authorities and to enlarge the mission of these authorities to contribute to the consistent application of the Directive throughout the Union, which may be the supervisory authority established under the General Data Protection Regulation. It clarifies the conditions for the independence of supervisory authorities, implementing case law of the Court of Justice. It sets out the competence of the supervisory authorities. It obliges Member States to provide for the duties of the supervisory authority, including hearing and investigating complaints and promoting the awareness of the public on risk, rules, safeguards and rights. A particular duty of the supervisory authorities in the context of this Directive is, where direct access is refused or restricted, to exercise the right of access on behalf of data subjects and to check the lawfulness of the data processing. Co-operation : the proposal introduces rules on mandatory mutual assistance. It provides that the European Data Protection Advisory Board, established by the General Data Protection Regulation, exercises its tasks also in relation to processing activities within the scope of this Directive. Remedies, liability and sanctions : the proposal provides: (i) for the right of any data subject to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (ii) that the bodies, organisations or associations which may lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject and also in case of a personal data breach independently of a data subject's complaint; (iii) for the right to a judicial remedy against a supervisory authority; (iv) the data subject may launch a court action for obliging the supervisory authority to act on a complaint; (v) the right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor; (vi) for the introduction of common rules for court proceedings, including the rights of bodies, organisations or associations to represent data subjects before the courts, and the right of supervisory authorities to engage in legal proceedings; (vii) for the Member States to provide for the right to compensation and lay down rules on penalties, to sanction infringements of the Directive, and to ensure their implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Data Protection Supervisor as specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. These implications require reprogramming of Heading 5 of the Financial Perspective. The total appropriations are estimated at EUR 24.339 million for 2014-2020. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

The parliamentary committee recommended that the position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure modify the Commission proposal as follows. Purpose of the regulation : this regulation should lay down rules for the creation and proper functioning of the Single European Sky in order to ensure current air traffic safety standards, to contribute to the sustainable development of the air transport system, and in particular, reducing climate impact. The Single European Sky shall comprise a coherent network at the pan-European level and, subject to specific arrangements with the neighbouring countries, in third-countries, an integrated operating airspace, network management and air traffic management for the benefit of all airspace users. National aviation authorities : these shall be legally distinct and independent, in particular in organisational, hierarchical and decision-making terms – and with their annual budget - from any company, organisation, public or private entity or personnel falling within the scope of authority activity as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 or having an interest in the activities of such entities. Staff of the national aviation authorities shall be recruited under clear and transparent rules and criteria which guarantee their independence. They shall not be seconded from air navigation service providers (ANSPs) or companies under the control of ANSPs. Persons who have been in charge of strategic decisions for more than six months shall have no professional position or responsibility with any of the air navigation service providers after their term in the national aviation authority, for a period ofat least 12 months for staff in managerial positions (at least six months for staff in non-managerial positions). Definitions : the Members added important definitions, namely that of a “local performance target” and “industrial partnership” which, according to the proposal, will now be a “driving force” within newly-structured functional airspace blocks (FABs). The definition of the “human factor” was also introduced, meaning the social, cultural and staffing conditions in the air traffic management (ATM) sector The human factor must be monitored and brought into the core of the Single European Sky framework. Cooperation between national aviation authorities : The Commission and the European Aviation Agency (EAA) shallfacilitate active cooperation of these authorities to enable them to exchange their best practices and to develop common solutions, including stronger cooperation at the regional level, and placing at their disposal a platform for these exchanges. This cooperation should take place in a network that convenes at regular intervals (at least once a year). The purpose and tasks of the network was spelled out in more detail: it must, among others, provide opinions to the Commission and the EAA on rule-making and certification and provide recommendations designed to facilitate the provision of cross-border services. Certification of air navigation service providers : the issue of certificates shall confer on air navigation service providers the possibility of offering their services to any Member State, and if appropriate, neighbouring third countries, within a functional airspace block, subject to mutual agreement between the relevant parties. Provision of support services : “support services” means communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS), meteorological services (MET) and aeronautical information services (AIS) as well as other services and activities, which are linked to, and support the provision of, air navigation services. According to the report, there should be no statutory impediments to providers of support services that would prevent their ability to compete within the Union on the basis of equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent conditions for the purpose of providing these services. Members proposed that air navigation service providers, when drawing up their business plans, should call for offers from different support services providers, with a view to choosing the financially and qualitatively most beneficial provider. Binding selection criteria for the entity procuring those services shall be, in particular, cost and energy efficiency, overall service quality, interoperability and safety of services, as well as transparency of the procurement process. System and performance criteria : Members proposed that a “performance review body” (PRB) be established as a European economic regulatorunder the supervision of the Commission, with effect from 1 July 2015. The PRB shall be functionally and legally separate from any service provider, whether at national or pan-European level. The compliance of the local performance plans and local targets with the Union-wide performance targets shall be assessed by the Commission in cooperation with the PRB. In addition to the introduction of sanctions, an appropriate compensation mechanism must also be established in order to address the problem stemming from the lack of synchronisation in SESAR deployment and lost investment resulting thereof. The Commission may propose financial mechanisms to improve the synchronisation of air-based and ground-based capital expenditure related to the deployment of SESAR technologies. Implementation of the ATM Master Plan : implementation of the ATM Master Plan shall be coordinated by the Commission. The Network Manager, the PRB and the Deployment Manager shall contribute to the implementation of the ATM Master Plan in accordance with the provisions of this regulation. The Commission shall adopt, by implementing acts, measures establishing the governance of implementation of the ATM Master Plan, including defining and selecting the body responsible at management level (Deployment Manager). Industrial partnerships : Members stipulated that industrial partnerships should be separate from FABs, which are a state initiative. What is more, industrial partnerships need not overlap with FABs in terms of the Member States concerned and therefore should be classed as a separate type of cooperation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: tourism plays a central role in Europe’s economy today. The travel market has evolved since the adoption of Directive 90/314/EEC. The Internet has become an increasingly important medium to offer travel services. Travel services are not only combined in the form of traditional pre-arranged packages, but are often combined in a customised fashion. Many of these travel products are either in a legal grey zone or are clearly not covered by Directive 90/314/EEC. It is therefore necessary to adapt the legislative framework to market developments, remove ambiguities and close legislative gaps. The modernisation of Directive 90/314/EEC responds to requests from the co-legislators and a large part of the industry and consumer organisations. A revision of the Directive is explicitly mentioned in the European Citizens' Report, the European Consumer Agenda and in the Single Market Act II. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment (IA) analysed eight policy options plus certain sub-options, including maintaining the status quo, the drawing up of guidelines, the introduction of a package travel “label”, self-regulation by the industry, various options to modernise the Directive, as well as the adoption of a “Travel Directive”. The chosen option is that of a graduated approach involving the modernisation of the Directive and the coverage of both one trader and multi-trader packages, while applying a lighter regime to “multi-trader” assisted travel arrangements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive seeks to clarify and modernise the scope of travellers' protection when purchasing combinations of travel services for the same trip or holiday by bringing within its scope different forms of on-line packages and assisted travel arrangements. The proposal will ensure that travellers are better informed about the services they are buying and grant them clearer remedies if something goes wrong. Package travel: the proposal: · lists specific pre-contractual information which organisers and, where applicable, retailers have to provide to travellers wishing to buy a package; · contains provisions on the content and the presentation of the contract or its confirmation, as well as on documents and information to be provided before the start of the package; · regulates the possibility and the consequence of price changes; · contains additional termination rights for travellers before the start of the package and grants travellers the right to terminate the contract without compensation in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances; · regulates the organiser's liability for the performance of the package and the obligation to provide assistance to the traveller; only the organiser is liable for the performance of the package; retailers involved in the booking of packages and assisted travel arrangements are liable for booking errors; · provides for the remedies available to the traveller in the event of the lack of performance and the improper performance of the services; · lays down the obligations to remedy the lack of conformity and to make suitable alternative arrangements for the continuation of the package where a significant proportion of the services cannot be provided as agreed in the contract. Where it is impossible to ensure the traveller's timely return because of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, the organiser's obligation to bear the cost for the continued stay is limited to EUR 100 per night and three nights per traveller; · provides that only package organisers and retailers who facilitate the purchase of 'assisted travel arrangements' are subject to theobligation to provide insolvency protection; · provides that travellers may address messages, complaints or claims also to the retailer. Assisted travel arrangement: these are defined as a combination of at least two different types of travel services for the purpose of the same trip or holiday, not constituting a package, resulting in the conclusion of separate contracts with the individual travel service providers. Retailers offering assisted travel arrangements would have to explain to travellers in a clear and prominent manner that only the relevant service providers are liable for performance of the services and that travellers will not benefit from any of the Union rights granted to package travellers, except the right to a refund of pre-payments and, where relevant, to repatriation in case the retailer itself or any of the service providers becomes insolvent. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only operational costs relate to the preparation of the report on the application of this Directive, covering the preparatory work of an external contractor, i.e. operational appropriation of EUR 0.2 million under the Rights and Citizenship programme, as well as administrative expenditure of around EUR 0.184 million during seven years after the adoption of the Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (""UNFCCC""), to which the Union is party, on the basis of existing scientific data, developed countries would need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % to 95 % below 1990 emissions by 2050 to limit global climate change to a temperature increase of 2°C and thus prevent undesirable climate effects. The Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 proposes a cost-effective way of achieving the necessary overall emission reductions in the Union by 2050. This roadmap establishes the sectoral contributions needed in six areas. Non-CO2 emissions (including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO2 emissions from agriculture) should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. In September 2011 the Commission published a report on the application of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases. It concluded that the Regulation could deliver significant emission reductions if it was further improved and fully applied. It also stated that more needed to be done to further reduce F-gas emissions in the EU. By ensuring that F-gases are replaced by safe alternatives with no or a lower impact on the climate, yearly emissions expressed in CO2 equivalent could be cut by two-thirds by 2030 at relatively low cost. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission, finally, only retained those options that were shown to deliver substantial emission savings at low abatement costs and to be consistent with other EU policies. The methodological basis for the impact assessment was a detailed analysis of the feasibility of introducing safe, energy-efficient alternatives in the 28 main sectors that use F-gases. The impact assessment showed that: a phase-down of HFCs that introduces gradually lower limits until 2030 for the amounts of these F-gases to be put on the market in the EU would deliver the most emission savings, reducing today’s emissions by two-thirds by 2030 (roughly 70 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent); an emission reduction of two thirds would prepare EU industry for a phase-down. It would lead to cost reductions due to higher market penetration and to economies of scale for alternative technologies, thus helping to reach an agreement on the proposals under the Montreal Protocol. Administrative costs can be kept relatively low (total administrative costs of around EUR 2 million a year for a phase-down). LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to: replace Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases in order to ensure a more cost-efficient contribution to achieving the EU’s climate objectives by discouraging the use of F-gases with a high impact on the climate in favour of energy-efficient and safe alternatives, and further improving the containment and end-of-life treatment of products and equipment that contain F-gases; enhance sustainable growth, stimulate innovation and develop green technologies by improving market opportunities for alternative technologies and gases with a low impact on the climate; bring the EU into line with the latest scientific findings at international level, as described in the Fourth Assessment Report of the UN’s IPCC, e.g. with regard to the substances covered by this regulation and the calculation of their global warming potential (GWP); help to bring about a consensus on an international agreement to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the most relevant group of F-gases, under the Montreal Protocol; simplify and clarify Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 to reduce administrative burden in line with the Commission’s commitment to better regulation. The key aspects of the proposal are as follows: Adaptation of existing provisions: the proposal maintains the current provisions of the F-Gas Regulation, with adjustments to ensure better implementation and enforcement of the legislation by national authorities. Some containment measures have also been extended to refrigerated trucks and trailers. Mechanism for the gradual reductions of HFCs: the most important new measure is the introduction of quantitative limits on the supply of bulk HFC substances in the EU, decreasing over time. The phase-down mechanism involves a gradually declining cap on the total placement of bulk HFCs (in tonnes of CO2 equivalent) on the market in the EU with a freeze in 2015, followed by a first reduction in 2016 and reaching 21 % of the levels sold in 2008–11 by 2030. By means of this mechanism: companies that place bulk HFCs on the EU market must have rights to place bulk substances on the EU market for the first time; the Commission allocates free quotas to companies based on past reporting data, with a reserve for new entrants; companies must make sure that they have enough rights to cover their actual placing of products and equipment on the market. the Commission checks compliance the following year, with independent verification of reports; a threshold ensures that companies that only place small quantities on the market are exempted. HFCs imported in pre-charged equipment: these should also be counted under the phase-down. Therefore, non-hermetically sealed HFC appliances would still be able to be produced in, or imported into, the EU but they would have to be filled at the place of installation. Similarly, the placing on the market of movable air conditioning containing HFCs will be banned from 2020. Additional bans: a few additional bans are introduced to underpin the phase-down mechanism and restrict the use of other F-gases not covered by the mechanism. Recharging of existing refrigeration equipment with a charge size over 5 tonnes of CO2 equivalent with HFC of very high GWP (>2500) will not be permitted from 2020 onwards as more adequate and energy efficient drop-in refrigerants of lower GWP are already widely available on the market. Restrictions on the use of SF6 in magnesium die casting is extended also to facilities using less than 850 kg per year as technological progress has rendered such use obsolete. Lastly, additional reporting obligations should enable monitoring of the use of F-gases that are not covered by current legislation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2011/92/EU (which codifies Directive 85/337/EEC and its three subsequent amendments) contains a legal requirement to carry out an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of public or private projects likely to have significant effects on the environment, prior to their authorisation. The Directive has become a key instrument of environmental integration and has also brought environmental and socio-economic benefits. The mid-term review of the 6th Environment Action Programme and the latest Commission report published in 2009 on the application and efficacy of the EIA Directive (Directive 85/337/EEC) stressed the need for improving the assessment of environmental impacts and to adapt the Directive to the policy, legal and technical context which has evolved considerably. The general objective of the proposal is to adjust the provisions of the codified EIA Directive (Directive 2011/92/EU), so as to correct shortcomings, reflect ongoing environmental and socio-economic changes and challenges, and align with the principles of smart regulation. The revision of the EIA Directive subscribes to the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular the priority of sustainable growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment, which is submitted with the proposal, identified shortcomings in the current EIA legislation that lead to unsatisfactory implementation and socio-economic costs in the implementation of the Directive. The shortcomings of the Directive can be grouped into three specific problem areas: (1) the screening procedure, (2) the quality and analysis of the EIA and (3) the risks of inconsistencies within the EIA process itself and in relation to other legislation. The IA assessed a number of policy options with the aim of identifying cost-effective measures to address these problems. Nine of the twelve amendments analysed are expected to provide significant environmental and socio-economic benefits without additional administrative costs; moderate savings are also expected. · Two amendments (assessment of alternatives and monitoring) are expected to provide high environmental and socio-economic benefits at moderate costs for developers and with limited or negligible costs for public authorities. · One amendment (adaptation of the EIA to new challenges) is expected to provide high benefits at moderate to high costs for developers and public authorities. In the long term, the significant environmental and socio-economic benefits and the moderate savings associated with the proposed amendments are likely to exceed the administrative costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal for the amendment of Directive 2011/92/EU aims to : (i) strengthen the provisions concerning the quality of the EIA with the aim of achieving a high level of environmental protection; (ii) enhance policy coherence and synergies with other EU law instruments and (iii) simplify procedures, with a view to reducing unnecessary administrative burdens. The main amendments are as follows: · Initial screening: it is proposed to clarify the screening procedure, by modifying the criteria of Annex III and specifying the content and justification of screening decisions. These amendments would ensure that EIAs are carried out only for projects that would have significant environmental effects, avoiding unnecessary administrative burden for small-scale projects. · Quality and analysis of the EIA : it is proposed to: (i) introduce amendments to reinforce the quality of the process (i.e. mandatory scoping and quality control of EIA information), (ii) specify the content of the EIA report (mandatory assessment of reasonable alternatives, justification of final decisions, mandatory post-EIA monitoring of significant adverse effects) and (iii) adapt the EIA to challenges (i.e. biodiversity, climate change, disaster risks, availability of natural resources). · Risk of inconsistencies : it is proposed to: (i) specify the time-frames for the main stages required by the Directive (public consultation, screening decision, final EIA decision) and (ii) introduce a mechanism, a kind of EIA one-stop shop to ensure coordination or joint operation of the EIA with the environmental assessments required under other relevant EU legislation, e.g. Directives 2010/75/EU, 92/43/EEC, 2001/42/EC. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: powers which may be delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a particular legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the implementing powers which shall be conferred on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed, as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers, the Commission has committed itself to reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU, legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (previously known as “comitology”). The overall objective is to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments by the end of Parliament’s seventh term (June 2014). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 in order to align it with the new institutional context. It is proposed to: empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adaptation of the list of customs procedures or provisions deriving from international conventions, changes necessary for methodological reasons and the necessity to set up an efficient system for the collection of data and the compilation of statistics; confer implementing powers on the Commission enabling it to adopt measures relating to the codes to be used for data referred to in Article 5(1) and also measures relating to the linking of the data on business characteristics with data recorded in accordance with the same Article. The Commission is also proposing to restructure the European Statistical System (ESS) to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure, with the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. In February 2012, the ESSC supported this new approach. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union’s General Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Copernicus is the new name of the European Earth Observation Programme, GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) which was established as an EU programme by the GMES Regulation (EU) No 911/2010. It covers all the activities for ensuring an uninterrupted provision of accurate and reliable data and information on environmental issues and security matters to users in charge of policy making, implementation and monitoring, in the EU and its Member States. Copernicus aims at providing Europe with a continuous, independent and reliable access to observation data and information. Responsibility for funding the exploitation and the renewal of space infrastructure developed with EU and intergovernmental funds cannot be optimally achieved by individual Member States because of the costs incurred. For the services with a pan-European or global coverage, Member States cannot sufficiently achieve the objectives of the proposed action, as the inputs from different Member States have to be aggregated at European level. The provision of other services (e.g. emergency maps or thematic land monitoring maps of a more limited geographical scope) can be better achieved at EU level for two reasons. 1. A more coherent and centralised management of input data, from space based or in situ sensors will allow for economies of scale; 2. An uncoordinated provision of Earth observation services at Member State level would lead to duplications and would render the monitoring of the implementation of EU environmental legislation on the basis of transparent and objective criteria difficult or even impossible. Action at EU level thus leads to a clear added value. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has carried out a consultation process since 2006 and the progressive implementation of the GMEs since 2010. Various consultations have confirmed the interest and the need for the Copernicus programme. An impact assessment was undertaken in 2011 and the main conclusions were published in SEC(2011)867 final of 28 June 2011, which accompanies the Commission proposal o n the Multiannual Financial Framework. The impact assessment has now been adapted to take account of the financial issues and the ownership transfer. In view of an ownership transfer, options will need to be assessed, taking account relevant factors including the operation of the satellites; legal ownership of the data; data access conditions; and the value of the assets. These options will only be considered if disadvantages of EU ownership seem to outweigh its advantages. The option of a data purchase scheme could also be considered. LEGAL BASIS: Article 189 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal focuses on the following main aspects: 1. Change of name into Copernicus; 2. Governance of GMES in its operational phase, with a view to allowing the Commission to delegate activities to a number of operators; 3. Funding over 2014-2020. Change of name : the acronym 'GMES' should be changed to 'Copernicus' in order to facilitate the communication with the public at large. The Commission has registered the trademark so that it can be used by the Union institutions and licensed to other interested users, in particular the providers of core services. Objectives : the objectives of the Copernicus programme are to provide accurate and reliable information in the field of the environment and security, tailored to the needs of users and supporting other Union’s policies, in particular relating to : the internal market, transport, environment, energy, civil protection, cooperation with third countries, humanitarian aid. Capacity and infrastructure : in order to attain its objectives, the Copernicus programme should rely on an autonomous Union’s capacity for space-borne observations and provide operational services in the field of environment, civil protection and security. It should also make use of the available in-situ data provided, namely, by the Member States. The provision of operational services depends on the well-functioning and safety of the Copernicus space component. Scope of the Copernicus services : the Copernicus services shall include: 1. Operational services: air quality monitoring systems; marine monitoring service which shall provide information on the state and dynamics of physical ocean and marine ecosystems for the global ocean and the European regional areas; land monitoring service (soil, water, forests as well as in general implementation of environment, agriculture, development, energy, urban planning, infrastructure and transport policies; climate change monitoring service (provision of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), climate analyses and projections at temporal and spatial scales relevant to adaptation and mitigation strategies for the various Union’s sectorial and societal benefit areas); emergency response service shall provide information for emergency response in relation to different types of disasters, including meteorological hazards, geophysical hazards, deliberate and accidental man-made disasters; security service shall provide information in particular for border and maritime surveillance,risk assessment and early warning systems. 2. Development activities consisting in improving the quality and performance of operational services, including their evolution and adaptation; 3. Support activities consisting in measures to promote the use of operational services by users and downstream applications, as well as communication and dissemination activities. Governance : the Commission shall have the overall responsibility for the programme. It shall define the priorities and objectives of the programme and oversee its implementation, in particular with respect to the cost, schedule and performance. Taking into account the partnership dimension of Copernicus and in order to avoid duplication of technical expertise, the implementation of the programme should be delegated to entities with the appropriate technical and professional capacity. The Commission may entrust, in part or in full, where duly justified by the special nature of the action and specific expertise of the Union body the implementation tasks to competent Union bodies. Among such agencies are: the European Environment Agency (EEA); the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX); the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA); the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC). Other Copernicus operators : the selection of entities (the “operators”) to whom the Commission may entrust implementation tasks, should follow a transparent procedure based on justified on objective grounds and shall not give rise to a conflict of interests. Given the particular nature of the tasks involved, an ad-hoc procedure based on a call for expression of interest was chosen to identify the potential operators best suited to be entrusted with indirect management of the Copernicus programme. The operators of the Copernicus programme should be subject to supervision by the Commission, whilst enjoying the necessary autonomy to implement the tasks they were entrusted with. They should submit an annual work programme to the Commission with an annual implementation report. Ownership : the question of ownership of the Copernicus space component assets is important and cannot be considered in isolation from the rights and responsibilities that such ownership confers upon the owner. The owner has the fullest possible rights including the right of use, transfer and disposal. The Union or a specifically designated body or fund shall be the owner of all tangible and intangible assets created or developed under the Copernicus programme subject to agreements concluded with third parties, wherever appropriate, with regard to existing ownership rights. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts to establish the terms and conditions of any subsequent transfer of ownership from the Union. Copernicus Data : Copernicus data and information shall be made available on a full, open and free-of-charge basis, subject to the following limitations: licensing conditions attached third party data and information; dissemination formats, characteristics and distribution means; security interests and external relations of the Union or its Member States; risk of disruption, for safety or technical reasons, of the system producing Copernicus data and information. Limitations and conditions of access and use have also been established. International cooperation : the Union, represented by the Commission, may enter into agreements with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries which are Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement; the candidate countries, as well as potential candidate countries; Switzerland, other third countries and international organisations. Third countries or international organisations may provide financial support or contributions in kind to the programme. Evaluation : by 30 June 2018 at the latest, an evaluation report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of all the tasks financed by the Copernicus programme at the level of their results and impacts and their European added value. Repeal : Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 is repealed in order to establish an appropriate framework for governance and funding and to ensure a fully operational Copernicus programme from 2014 onwards. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial statement accompanying this proposal for a Regulation sets out indicative budget appropriations, which are compatible with the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, with a maximum level of commitments of EUR 3,786 million, in 2011 prices, equivalent to EUR 4,291 million in current prices. Until the end of 2013, Copernicus is funded by the FP7 Space theme and the GMES and its Initial Operations programme. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU concerning: the establishment of the data requirements necessary for the operational services; the conditions and procedures as regards access to, registration and use of Copernicus data and information, including the formats, characteristic and dissemination means; the conditions and procedures for the transmission and use of satellite data transmitted to receiving stations not part of the Copernicus programme; the conditions and procedures for the archiving of Copernicus data and information; the specific technical criteria necessary to prevent the disruption of the Copernicus data and information system, including priority of access; the criteria for the restriction of dissemination of Copernicus data and information due to conflicting rights or security interests; the criteria for the performance of the security assessment. The Commission shall carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.When preparing and drawing up delegated acts, it should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 setting up the European GNSS Agency. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: BACKGROUND: security requirements play an essential role in the design, implementation and operation of the infrastructures emerging from the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. The provisions of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 expressly lay down the terms under which the Agency must perform its task concerning security accreditation of the systems. In order to ensure that the security accreditation activities are performed in an independent manner, including, to a large extent, the Regulation provides the Agency with an independent body, the Security Accreditation Board, which constitutes one of the three separate roles of the Agency along with the Executive Director and the Administrative Board. On 30 November 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on the implementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems. This future GNSS Regulation will replace Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 as of 1 January 2012 and determine the governance framework during the 2014-2020 period. In particular, it stipulates that most of the tasks associated with the operation of both the Galileo and EGNOS systems will be entrusted to the European GNSS Agency. The commitment expressed by the Commission in its proposal to delegating these tasks to the Agency is shared by the European Parliament and the Council. In this new context, it is essential to ensure that the Security Accreditation Board is able to carry out the task entrusted to it with complete independence, in particular vis-à-vis the other bodies and activities of the Agency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission's proposal was not subject to an impact assessment; nor did it follow formal consultation of the parties concerned. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 with a view ensuring the independence of the exercise of activities relating to security systems accreditation as well as the separation between these activities and other activities of the European GNSS Agency. To do so, the proposal provides mainly for an increase in the powers of the Security Accreditation Board and those of the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board, by partly aligning them with those of the Administrative Board and the Executive Director respectively, while providing for a cooperation requirement between the various bodies of the Agency. Security Accreditation Board: it is proposed that this Board, and not the Administrative Board prepares and approves the part of the Agency work programmes describing the operational activities associated with security accreditation of the systems as well as the part of the annual report concerning the activities and prospects of the Agency with regard to the systems' security accreditation activities and submits them in good time to the Administrative Board so that they can be incorporated in the Agency's work programme and annual report. Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board: it would be desirable to assign a role in relation to security accreditation activities to the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board comparable to that of the Executive Director in other Agency activities. Therefore, in addition to the function of representing the Agency, already provided for under Regulation (EU) No 912/2010, the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board should: manage the security accreditation activities under the direction of the Security Accreditation Board and ensure the implementation of the part of the Agency work programmes associated with accreditation; at the request of the Parliament or the Council, submit a report on the performance of its tasks and make a declaration before these institutions. Furthermore, given the involvement of a number of third countries in the European GNSS programmes, including in security matters, express provision should be made for representatives of third countries to be able to participate under conditions to be specified in the work of the Security Accreditation Board. Lastly, Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 must be made consistent with the principles contained in the shared approach of the Parliament, Council and Commission to the decentralised agencies, adopted by the three institutions on 5 July, 26 June and 12 June 2012 respectively. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the legislative financial statement associated with Regulation (EU) No 912/2010, which accompanies the proposal and incorporates the new staff requirements of the Agency relating to the new tasks which may be entrusted to it, such as the exploitation of the European GNSS systems, translates these requirements in financial terms. In budgetary terms, the amounts required are already included in the Commission's proposal for the next financial framework 2014-2020. They will be financed by redeployment within the budget headings of the GNSS programmes in the same way as the additional requirements for 2013. It should be noted that the expenditure associated with the new staff requirements of the Agency will be partially offset by a reduction of 30 posts in the Commission's establishment plan during the same period, i.e. from 2014 to 2020. The total estimated impact on the Agency’s budget (operational and administrative expenditure) amounts to EUR 204.318 million for the period 2013-2020. This estimate is provisional because it is dependent on the adoption of the next multiannual finanancial framework 2014-2020 by the budgetary authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the policies relating to the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice have been growing steadily over the last years. Their importance has been confirmed by the Stockholm Programme and its Action Plan, the implementation of which is a strategic priority for the next five years and covers areas such as migration (legal migration and integration; asylum; irregular migration and return), security (prevention of and fight against terrorism and organised crime; police cooperation) and management of the external borders (including visa policy), as well as the external dimension of these policies. The Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020: a budget for delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. In the area of home affairs policies, covering security, migration and the management of external borders, the Commission proposed to simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to a two pillar structure: an Asylum and Migration Fund and an Internal Security Fund. This Regulation establishes the Asylum and Migration Fund which draws on the capacity building process developed with the assistance of the European Refugee Fund4, the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals5 and the European Return Fund and extends it to cover more comprehensively different aspects of the common Union asylum and immigration policy. Recent events at the Greek/Turkish border and in the Southern Mediterranean have also demonstrated how important it is for the Union to have a comprehensive approach to migration, covering various aspects such as: strengthened border management and Schengen governance, better targeted legal migration, enhanced dissemination of best practices on integration, a reinforced Common European Asylum System, and a more strategic approach to relations with third countries on migration. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. Work on the preparation of the future financial instruments for home affairs started in 2010 and continued into 2011. It was completed in July 2011 and brought together available evaluation results for the existing financial instruments and informed the problems, objectives and policy options, including their likely impact, examined in the impact assessment. On the basis of this study, the Commission drafted an impact assessment report. The main conclusion may be summarised as follows: to broaden the scope of action for Union funding in the field of asylum and migration, including as regards its external dimension, to work towards more simplification of delivery mechanisms and greater flexibility, notably to respond to emergencies. In the area of asylum and migration, stakeholders considered that the broad thematic priorities have already been fixed by the Stockholm Programme and its Action Plan. There was broad support to reduce the number of financial instruments to a two-Fund structure on the condition that this would actually lead to simplification. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 78(2) and 79(2) and (4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 the Asylum and Migration Fund. General objective : the general objective of the Fund shall be to contribute to an effective management of migration flows in the Union as part of the area of freedom, security and justice, in accordance with the common policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection and the common immigration policy. Specific objectives : within its general objective, the Fund shall contribute to the following specific objectives: to strengthen and develop the Common European Asylum System, including its external dimension; to support legal migration to the Union in line with the economic and social needs of Member States and promote the effective integration of third-country nationals, including of asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection; to enhance fair and effective return strategies in the Member States with emphasis on sustainability of return and effective readmission in the countries of origin; to enhance the solidarity and responsibility sharing between the Member States, in particular towards those most affected by migration and asylum flows. For each of these objectives, key indicators are defined. Actions in or in relation to third countries : the Fund shall support actions catering primarily for Union interests, having a direct impact in the Union and its Member States and ensuring a necessary continuity with activities implemented in the territory of the Union. Actions that are directly development oriented shall not be supported through this Fund. In implementing such actions, full coherence will be sought with the principles and general objectives of the Union external action related to the country or region in question. Implementation : the specific implementing measures are laid down in a separate Regulation (Horizontal Regulation). Resources for Member States : t he most important part of the resources available under the Fund will be channelled through national programmes of Member States covering the whole period 2014-2020. For this purpose, the amount of resources to be allocated to the Member States within the Fund will be composed of a basic amount and a variable amount. Following a mid-term review an additional amount may be allocated as of budget year 2018. (1) Basic amount : the b asic amount is established on the basis of latest available statistical data relating to the migration flows, such as the number of first asylum applications, positive decisions granting refugee or subsidiary protection, number of resettled refugees, stock and flows of legally residing third-country nationals, number of return decisions issued by the national authorities and the number of effected returns. Those data are the same as those used so far for the calculation of allocations under the European Refugee Fund, the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals and the European Return Fund. In order to ensure critical mass for the implementation of national programmes, EUR 5 million is added as a minimum amount to each Member State. The basic amounts earmarked to individual Member States will serve as a basis to start the policy dialogue , followed by the multiannual programming, to support, on the hand, a limited number of compulsory objectives (e.g. strengthening the establishment of Common European Asylum System by ensuring the efficient and uniform application of the Union acquis on asylum or developing an assisted voluntary return programme including a component on reintegration) and, on the other hand, to address the specific needs of each Member State. (2) Variable amount : the variable amount will be allocated following the policy dialogue mentioned above to those Member States willing to work in those operational fields which depend on their political commitment and willingness to act, or ability to cooperate with other Member States. This will be the case for the implementation of specific actions such as for: instance joint processing of asylum applications, joint return operations, setting up of joint migration centres, the implementation of resettlement and relocation operations. As regards resettlement : Member States will receive financial incentives (lump sums) every two years on the basis of their pledging which will follow the establishment of common Union resettlement priorities. These will be the result of a political process involving in particular the European Parliament and the Council and reflecting the policy developments at national and Union level. Through these financial incentives, two objectives are to be achieved: a quantitative one, i.e. to increase significantly the current resettlement figures which are too small, and a qualitative one, i.e. to strengthen the European dimension through the implementation of defined and dynamic common Union resettlement priorities. Moreover, based on a similar pledging exercise and at regular intervals, Member States will receive financial incentives (lump sums) for relocation of beneficiaries of international protection. Mid-term allocation : a part of available resources will be kept for mid-term review. This will, on the one hand, allow allocating additional amounts to those Member States undergoing significant changes in migration flows and presenting specific needs concerning their asylum and reception systems and, on the other hand, to allocate additional amounts to those Member States willing to implement specific actions. The latter may be revised in line with the most recent policy developments. Union Agencies : to use more effectively the competence and expertise of relevant Union agencies in the home affairs field, the Commission also envisages to make use of the possibility offered by the Financial Regulation to entrust, within the resources available under this Regulation, the implementation of specific tasks to such agencies, in the framework of their missions and in complementarity with their work programmes. For the tasks covered by this Regulation this concerns in particular the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex Agency) for activities in and outside the EU requiring operational expertise on issues related to asylum and irregular immigration, respectively. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to supplement or amend provisions of this Regulation on the lump sums for resettlement and relocation, the definition of specific actions and of common Union resettlement priorities, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the Commission's proposal for a Multi-Annual Financial Framework includes a proposal of EUR 3 869 million (in current prices) for Asylum and Migration Fund for the period 2014-2020. Indicatively more than 80% of this amount (EUR 3 232 million) should be used for national programmes of Member States while EUR 637 million should be centrally managed by the Commission to fund Union actions, emergency assistance, European Migration Network, technical assistance and the implementation of specific operational tasks by Union agencies."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Home affairs policies have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. These policies are at the heart of the European project to create an area without internal borders where EU citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. The Commission adopted a proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: a budget for delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. The Commission proposed to simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to a two-Fund structure: an Asylum and Migration Fund and an Internal Security Fund. Experience suggests that in the current programming period, the diversity and fragmentation of rules governing spending programmes are often perceived as unnecessarily complicated and difficult to implement and control. This imposes a heavy administrative burden on beneficiaries as well as on the Commission and Member States, which can have the unintended effect of discouraging participation, increasing error rates and delaying implementation. This means that the potential benefits of Union programmes are not fully realised. This Regulation is part of a package of four Regulations, jointly establishing the framework for Union funding on home affairs under the two Funds. This Regulation lays down rules on programming, management and control, financial management, clearance of accounts, closure of programmes and reporting and evaluation. Thus, it sets out the delivery mechanisms whereas the purpose and scope of the two Funds, the resources and means of implementation are defined in their respective specific Regulations. This horizontal instrument will ensure a common approach to the implementation of the two Funds and a uniform treatment of beneficiaries in relation to all Union support in the area of home affairs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: i accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. The impact assessment identified problems in relation to the scope and priorities of the current home affairs spending programmes on the one hand and the problems regarding the delivery of funding on the other hand. In relation to the latter, the impact assessment examined options in relation to shared management, centralised management and the timely response to emergency situations. In relation to shared management , the impact assessment concluded that a multiannual programme preceded by a policy dialogue was the preferred option. Contrary to the status quo, which combines annual programmes within a multiannual framework, it would significantly reduce administrative workload. In terms of improving the delivery of funding under centralised management , the status quo was discarded because it offers little or no prospect of simplification or reduction of administrative workload. Recourse to a more targeted, less resource-intensive and diversified centralised management is the preferred option because it is expected to improve relations with key stakeholders and to lead to an overall reduction in workload. In relation to the emergency response mechanism , the impact assessment concluded that the current mechanism clearly does not meet the need for a quicker and more effective response to crises in the areas of migration and security. An improved mechanism extended to both a wider range of migration-related crises and security-related crises was considered the preferred option. Stakeholders supported the idea of reducing the number of financial instruments to a two-Fund structure on the condition that this would actually lead to simplification. They also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism to allow the Union to respond quickly and effectively to migration and security-related crises. Shared management with a move to multi-annual programming with the definition of common targets at Union level was generally seen as the appropriate management method for all home affairs spending although non-governmental organisations were of the view that direct management should also be continued . LEGAL BASIS: Articles 78(2), 79(2), 79(4), 82(1), 84 and 87(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In light of this legal basis, the provisions of this Regulation lay down horizontal common provisions for the implementation of the Asylum and Migration Fund and one component of the Internal Security Fund, namely the instrument for financial support for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management. CONTENT: this Regulation lays down obligations only of a financial and technical nature and leaves the choices on the definition of policy objectives, eligible actions, the allocation of resources and the scope of the intervention for each specific policy area to the respective legal basis (i.e. in the Specific Regulations). As a new general framework for implementing Union funding in the area of home affairs policies, this Regulation sets outs general rules on the financing of expenditure including rules on partnership, programming, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, the management and control systems to be put in place by the Member States and the clearance of accounts. General principles : the proposed Regulation seeks to lay down the conditions for: a more policy-driven and results-oriented funding, including through reinforced strategic programming; a significant simplification of the delivery mechanisms compared to the current situation; more flexibility in financial management and in the implementation, in light of the need to be able to address new and unforeseen circumstances typical of home affairs; an enhanced monitoring and evaluation framework, ensuring accountability, transparency and informed reflection on future support in the area of home affairs. The main principles are detailed as follows: (1) A policy-driven and results-oriented agenda (a) For shared management : at the beginning of the next Multiannual Financial Framework, there will be a single, overarching home affairs policy dialogue with each Member State on their use of the Funds. Taking into account the outcome of the policy dialogue, the programmes agreed between the Commission and the Member State will describe the baseline situation and lay down the objectives Member States are to achieve in the policy area and the objectives for the use of Union funding. The national programme will identify targets and examples of actions per objective. In addition, a seven-year financial plan will indicate how the allocated resources are to be committed and spent, within the ceilings available. In case of actions to be implemented in and in relation to third countries, such actions should not be directly development-oriented and the policy dialogue should seek full coherence with the principles and general objectives of the Union external action and foreign policy related to the country or region in question. It is also provides that: Member States will report annually on financial management and the results achieved under the programmes; there will be a mid-term review in 2017 to re-examine the situation in each Member State. At this occasion, new resources can be allocated for the period 2018-2020. (b) For direct and indirect management : the objectives to be achieved under the national programmes will be complemented by ""Union actions"" as well as a rapid response mechanism to deal with emergency situations. Union actions will support the implementation of Union policies through grants and procurement. They will include actions in and in relation to third countries as indicated in the Communication on the Multiannual Financial Framework. Such actions shall not be directly development oriented and shall complement, as appropriate, the financial assistance provided through the EU's external aid instruments. Union actions and emergency assistance measures may also be carried out by Union Agencies in the area of home affairs (Cepol, Europol, EASO, Frontex and the IT Agency). Technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission will be used to support Member States and beneficiaries, to encourage mutual learning and improve communication (including corporate communication where appropriate) and evaluation. These appropriations will also support adequate control measures in the Union and in third countries relating to actions funded. (2) Simplification of delivery mechanisms (a) For shared management : each Member State will be required to have a single national programme per Fund, thus bringing together various policy areas. The new framework represents a major simplification and reduction of administrative burden compared to the current four Funds, which work with both a multiannual strategy and annual programmes. a low number of revisions of national programmes are expected (there should be, per Member State and per Fund, one decision to approve the multiannual programme and, if needed, one decision to revise the programme in the context of the mid-term review); each Member States will set up a single management and control system per Fund, with the possibility of having one system to cover both Funds; the eligibility of expenditure shall be determined on the basis of national rules, subject to a limited number of common, simple principles (simplified cost options such as flat rates and lump sums in particular). (b) For direct and indirect management : - in the event of emergency situations: the mechanism shall be triggered by the Commission, also following the initiative of Member States, the Article 71 Committee (COSI) represented by the respective Union Presidency or other stakeholders such as international organisations, etc; all possible means will be used to avoid fragmentation by concentrating resources on a limited number of Union objectives; - for the financial support to the development of new IT systems (""the smart borders package""), the current annual financial decisions enabling the Commission to develop the central parts will be replaced by a multiannual framework. (3) Flexibility (a) For shared management : the impact of the mid-term review will depend on the situation in the Member States. Member States which are deemed to have additional risks or which obtain additional resources to implement Union specific priorities would be invited to revise the amounts in their financial plan and where appropriate to add elements in their programme. Financial flexibility will be implemented notably through the different mechanisms provided by these proposals, bearing in mind as central phases for their implementation the multiannual financial programming and its annual update, the annual budget allocation and the annual budget implementation. (b) For direct and indirect management : annual appropriations for Union actions, emergency assistance and, subject to annual ceilings, the technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission, are considered as one ""envelope"", thereby allowing maximum flexibility to decide from one financial year to another where the resources will be allocated, depending on the specific needs. The specific Regulations foresee implementation in relation to all the policies and objectives supported by the Funds and even financing policy-related aspects of the operation of the Funds. (4) A coherent and efficient reporting, monitoring and evaluation framework (a) For shared management : Member States will report annually on the implementation of the multiannual programme, as an integral part of the clearance of accounts' exercise. To feed into the mid term review process, they will be requested in 2017 to provide additional information on the progress made in achieving the objectives. A similar exercise will be undertaken in 2019, to allow, where appropriate, adjustments during the last financial year (2020). Supporting the development of a evaluation-based culture in the area of home affairs, the Funds will have a common evaluation and monitoring framework with broad policy related indicators which underline the result-oriented approach to the Funds and the essential role they could play in the policy mix to achieve the objectives towards an area of freedom, security and justice. All measures will be established at the beginning of the programming period, thus enabling Member States to set up their reporting and evaluation systems on the basis of the agreed principles and requirements. To reduce the administrative burden and ensure synergies between reporting and evaluation, the information required for evaluation reports will build on and complete the information provided by Member States in the annual implementation reports of the national programmes. The interim evaluation report is due in 2018 and should feed into the reflection on the subsequent programming period. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to amend provisions of this Regulation on the common principles on the eligibility of expenditure, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

This Fund will take over from the External Borders Fund 2007-2013 which shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the policies related to the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. These policies are at the heart of the European project to create an area without internal borders where Union citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. In the field of Internal Security, key documents such as the Commission's Communication on the Internal Security Strategy have provided clear guidance on the direction of activities in the years to come. For border management and visa policy, the Communication on Migration outlined in more detail the challenges ahead in relation to border security and the development of an area without internal borders. The Communication on the Schengen governance presented proposals to strengthen the Schengen acquis by means of a governance system capable of responding effectively, and in a timely and coordinated Union-wide way, to exceptional circumstances and challenges which might put the overall functioning of Schengen at stake. The Communication on smart borders – options and the way ahead outlines how new IT systems such as an Entry/exit system and a Registered Traveller Programme can contribute to a better management of migration flows in the Union. A key component in the common integrated border management system has been the development of Union solidarity mechanisms, supporting a uniform and high-quality application of the Union standards on border management and the common visa policy. Enhancing the coordination of operational co-operation by the Member States on border control through the Frontex Agency constitutes an important step towards the development of the system. Moreover, with the External Borders Fund, the Union expresses solidarity through financial assistance to those Member States that apply the Schengen provisions on external borders and visa. It is against this background that the Commission, in its proposal on the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020, suggested to set up an Internal Security Fund, as part of a simplified two-Fund structure for future expenditure in the home affairs area which also includes the creation of an Asylum and Migration Fund. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. Work on the preparation of the future financial instruments for home affairs started in 2010 and continued into 2011. It was completed in July 2011 and brought together available evaluation results for the existing financial instruments and informed the problems, objectives and policy options, including their likely impact, examined in the impact assessment. On the basis of this study, the Commission drafted an impact assessment report. The main conclusion may be summarised as follows: to broaden the scope of action for Union funding in the field of asylum and migration, including as regards its external dimension, to work towards more simplification of delivery mechanisms and greater flexibility, notably to respond to emergencies. In the area of internal security, stakeholders considered that the broad thematic priorities have already been fixed by the 2009 Stockholm Programme and the 2010 Internal Security Strategy. A future funding mechanism should therefore be defined comprehensively, comprising law enforcement, border guards and customs communities. The need to make greater use of relevant Union agencies, such as Europol and Frontex was also considered important. There was broad support to reduce the number of financial instruments to a two-Fund structure on the condition that this leads to simplification. Stakeholders also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The creation of the Internal Security Fund requires the adoption of two legislative instruments which jointly constitute the Fund. This overall structure was chosen in light of the Treaty obligations. It is not legally possible to draw up one single comprehensive legislative proposal for an Internal Security Fund, despite the coherence of the policy objectives to be addressed. The Internal Security Fund is therefore created as a comprehensive financial framework which is composed of two separate acts, setting up the different components of the Fund and laying down the objectives, the eligible actions and the envelopes of each component: - A Regulation setting up, as part of the Fund, the component for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management; - This Regulation setting up, as part of the Fund, the border management and common visa policy component. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission proposes to establish the instrument for financial support for the management of external borders and the common visa policy as part of the Internal Security Fund. Jointly with the future Regulation establishing as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management, this Regulation establishes for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 the Internal Security Fund. Main objectives : the general objective of the Instrument shall be to contribute to ensuring a high level of security in the European Union. Within the general objective, the Instrument shall contribute - in line with the priorities identified in relevant EU Strategies, programmes, threat and risk assessments - to the following specific objectives: supporting a common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel, ensure equal treatment of third country nationals and tackle irregular migration; supporting borders management , to ensure, on one hand, a high level of protection of external borders and, on the other hand, the smooth crossing of the external borders in conformity with the Schengen acquis. To achieve these objectives, the instrument shall contribute to the following operational objectives: support and reinforce the national capabilities in the area of border control and visa policy and thus expressing financial solidarity with the tasks entrusted to individual Member States at external borders and in consulates in the interest of the border-free area as a public service provided to the Union (national programmes, including ""operating support""); finance the development of the smart border package , i.e. the setting up of an EU Entry Exit System (EES) and an EU Registered Traveller Programme (RTP); finance the introduction and operation of the European Border Surveillance System, EUROSUR , notably through the purchase of equipment, infrastructure and systems in Member States; reinforce the Schengen governance and the evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis by (a) funding the operation of that mechanism under direct management; (b) introducing conditionalities based on compliance with the Schengen acquis for the disbursement of operating support to Member States and (c) requiring Member States to (re)allocate resources received for programmes under this instrument with priority to remedy weaknesses if these have been identified under the mechanism; boost the operational potential of the Frontex Agency by inviting Member States to earmark additional resources under their programmes for specialised equipment which can be put at the disposal of the Agency for its joint operations; support the development and implementation of the relevant Union policies in the EU, in and with third countries under ""Union actions"", thus improving the overall management of migration flows to the Union (projects managed either directly, such as studies or pilot projects to reinforce co-operation with third countries, or indirectly, in accordance with the Financial Regulation; have readily available adequate resources to provide emergency assistance in case of situations of urgent or exceptional migratory pressure; continue support for the functioning of the Specific Transit Scheme for Lithuania , in accordance with the obligations of the EU10, providing support to compensate for foregone fees from transit visas and additional costs incurred by Lithuania in implementing the Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) scheme, such as replacing and upgrading equipment, IT systems, training and operational costs. For each of these objectives, key indicators are defined. It should be noted that actions related to the temporary and exceptional reintroduction of border control at internal borders as referred to in the Schengen Borders Code are not eligible. Implementation : the Commission envisages to give the implementation tasks of this programme to the Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT-Systems in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice (IT Agency). This Regulation would in this case be amended at the appropriate time to include the tasks specifically in the mission of the Agency. Allocation of Funds : in view of the above, the allocation of funding under shared management is based on a combination of: a basic amount allocated to the Member States at the start of the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF); a flexible amount to be added to the basic amount, allocated in two phases. (1) The basic amount is allocated to the Member States at the start of the next MFF and calculated on the basis of objective criteria and needs. It is 60% of the overall envelope for national programmes and the allocations are laid down per Member State in Annex I of this Regulation. They are based on the 2010-2012 calculations under the External Borders Fund, whilst incorporating a minimum amount for each Member State. This will ensure some continuity with the current MFF and give the Member States financial stability to plan their national multiannual programmes. (2) The flexible amount will be added to the basic amount depending on the willingness of each Member State to finance under its national programme actions that respond to specific Union priorities. These specific actions are defined in Annex II and can be amended. In principle, it would be allocated in two phases: at the start of the MFF, as part of the policy dialogue and negotiations on the national programmes of the relevant Member States, and during a mid-term review in 2017. This mid-term review would be the occasion to re-examine the situation in Member States and to allocate new resources for the remaining years of the MFF (2018-2020). Mid-term review : this mid-term review would be the occasion to re-examine the situation in Member States and to allocate new resources for the remaining years of the MFF (2018-2020). These risk/needs assessments could be produced with the help of the Frontex Agency. Member States who, on the basis of these assessments, have more needs or face increased risks will receive an additional amount, thereby giving tangible expression to the principle of solidarity and responsibility-sharing. Union agencies : to use more effectively the competences and expertise of relevant Union agencies in the home affairs field, the Commission also envisages to make use of the possibility offered by the Financial Regulation to entrust, with the resources available under this Regulation, the implementation of specific tasks to such agencies, in the framework of their missions and in complementarity to their work programmes. For the tasks covered under this Instrument this concerns in particular: (i) the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex Agency), for activities in and outside the Union requiring operational expertise on border control;(ii) the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), for activities such as training on asylum addressed to border guards; (iii) the European Police Office (Europol) and the European Police College (CEPOL) in the light of interagency co-operation of law enforcement authorites with border guards; (iv) the Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT-Systems in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (IT Agency) insofar as the development of new IT systems is concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the Commission's proposal for the next multi-annual framework includes a proposal of EUR 4 648 million (in current prices) for the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014-2020. Within this global envelope, the resources available for the implementation of this specific Regulation amount to EUR 3,520 million. Indicatively: about 61% of this amount (EUR 2 150 million) should be used for national programmes of Member States and the support to the Special Transit Scheme implemented by Lithuania; 31% (EUR 1 100 million) should be dedicated to the development of the smart border package and the remainder should then be available to fund Union actions, emergency actions and technical assistance, whilst taking into account also the contributions expected from the Schengen associated countries, which would be added to the total envelope. Moreover, outside the scope of the Internal Security Fund, a separate envelope of EUR 822 million (current prices) is set aside for the management of existing large scale-IT systems (Schengen Information System II, Visa Information System and Eurodac). The management of these systems will gradually be transferred from the Commission to the future Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT-Systems in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (IT Agency) after it begins operations in late 2012. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to supplement or amend provisions in this instrument regarding the definition of specific actions under the national programmes the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: network and information systems and services play a vital role in in facilitating the cross-border movement of goods, services and people. Substantial disruption of these systems in one Member State can affect other Member States and the EU as a whole. The resilience and stability of network and information systems is therefore essential to the smooth functioning of the internal market. The extent and frequency of security incidents, caused by human error or malicious attacks is increasing : the Commission’s public consultation found that 57 % of respondents had experienced NIS incidents over the previous year that had a serious impact on their activities. A 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that 38% of EU internet users are concerned about the safety of online payments. There is currently no effective mechanism at EU level for effective cooperation and collaboration and for secure information sharing on NIS incidents and risks among the Member States. However, the Digital Agenda for Europe and the related Council conclusions highlighted the shared understanding that trust and security are fundamental pre-conditions for the wide uptake of information and communication technologies (ICT). This proposal is presented in connection with the joint Communication of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on a European Cybersecurity Strategy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed three different options. · Option 1 : status quo: maintain the current approach. · Option 2: regulatory approach, consisting of a legislative proposal establishing a common EU legal framework for NIS regarding Member State capabilities, mechanisms for EU-level cooperation, and requirements for key private players and public administrations. · Option 3: mixed approach, combining voluntary initiatives for Member State NIS capabilities and mechanisms for EU-level cooperation with regulatory requirements for key private players and public administrations. The Commission concluded that Option 2 would have the strongest positive impacts. The quantitative assessment showed that this option would not impose a disproportionate burden on Member States. The costs for the private sector would also be limited since many of the entities concerned are already supposed to comply with existing security requirements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to effect a fundamental change in the way NIS is dealt with in the EU. It provides for regulatory obligations to create a level playing field and close existing legislative loopholes. The objectives of the proposed Directive are as follows: (1) To require all Member States to have in place a minimum level of national capabilities by establishing competent authorities for NIS, setting up Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), and adopting national NIS strategies and national NIS cooperation plans. (2) To ensure that the national competent authorities cooperate within a network enabling secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange as well as detection and response at EU level. Through this network, Member States will exchange information and cooperate, through the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) to counter NIS threats and incidents and facilitate a uniform application of the directive throughout the EU. (3) To ensure that a culture of risk management develops and that information is shared between the private and public sectors. Companies in the specific critical sectors – banking, stock exchanges, energy generation, transmission and distribution, transport (air, rail, maritime), health, internet services as well as public administrations will be required to: · assess the risks they face and adopt appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure NIS; · report to the competent authorities any incidents seriously compromising their networks and information systems and significantly affecting the continuity of critical services and supply of goods. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: cooperation and exchange of information between Member States should be supported by a secure infrastructure. The proposal will have EU budgetary implications only if Member States choose to adapt an existing infrastructure (e.g. sTESTA) and task the Commission to implement this under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. The one-off cost is estimated to be EUR 1 250 000 on condition that sufficient funds are available under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Alternatively, Member States can either share the one-off cost of adapting an existing infrastructure or decide to set up a new infrastructure and bear the costs, which are estimated to be approximately EUR 10 million per year. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the crisis in the financial markets which has unfolded since 2008 has put the issue of financial reporting and auditing at the centre of the Union's political agenda. A well- functioning common financial reporting framework is essential for the internal market, for the effective functioning of the capital markets and for the realisation of the integrated market for financial services in the EU. In a global economy, there is a need for a global accounting language. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were adopted by the EU in 2002 and used in many jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, Europe will need more weight in the international standard setting process for its voice to be heard. promote the global adoption of IFRS; Decision No 716/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a Community programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing. On the basis of that Decision, (i) the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), the European Commission's technical adviser in accounting matters, (ii) the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation; the legal successor of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, IASCF) and (iii) the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) benefit from Union co-financing in the form of operating grants until 31 December 2013. The purpose of the proposed Regulation is to renew that Programme for the next financial framework (2014-2020) and enable direct contributions to the funding of the Programme's beneficiaries from the Union budget during that period. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in the ex ante evaluation accompanying this proposal, the Commission found that the Programme for 2009 to 2013 had met the expectations and objectives set and that financing should be continued. Moreover, the financing Programme was set up with the aim of meeting long-term objectives. Thus, it is appropriate to propose it being continued in the next financial framework of 2014-2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a Union programme for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 to support the activities of bodies which contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives of the Union in relation to financial reporting and auditing. The co-financing programme is expected to contribute to the objectives of: · ensuring comparability and transparency of company accounts throughout the EU; · ensuring the global harmonisation of financial reporting standards by promoting the international acceptance of IFRS; · promoting convergence and high quality international standards for auditing in all Member States. The programme also contributes to the Europe 2020 strategy by reinforcing the single market of financial services and capital, and contributes to the strategy's external dimension as well. The Programme covers: (i) the activities of developing or providing input to the development of standards; (ii) activities relating to applying, assessing or monitoring standards or overseeing standard-setting processes in support of the implementation of Union policies in the field of financial reporting and auditing. The beneficiaries under the Programme are the following: · in the field of financial reporting: (i)the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG); (ii) the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation); · in the field of auditing: the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). Within the current institutional framework, the new funding arrangements will ensure stable, diversified, sound and adequate funding to enable the relevant bodies to carry out their Union-related or Union public interest mission in an independent and efficient manner. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total amount to be borne by the Union’s budget is EUR 58.01 million in commitment appropriations for the 2014-2020 period. The financial envelope is divided up as follows: · IFRS Foundation: EUR 32 227 000 · EFRAG: EUR 23 508 000 · PIOB: EUR 2 275 000 EUR. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Council Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine2 applies to trade in bovine animals and swine within the Union. That Directive provides that the competent authority in a Member State may introduce a system of surveillance networks. Those networks include a computer database which is to contain at least a number of elements laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC, inter alia the identification code of each animal. The Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and deleting the provisions on voluntary beef labelling, makes necessary to amend accordingly Council Directive 64/432/EEC as regards computer databases which are part of the surveillance networks in the Member States. The elements of the computer databases laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC do not include so far any reference to electronic means of identification. In the interest of consistency of Union legislation, such element should be added to the list of elements to be included in the computer databases laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union has concluded a number of multilateral, regional and bilateral international trade agreements creating rights and obligations for the mutual benefit of the parties. The Union may be called on to take unilateral measures to enforce and defend its rights and interests under international trade agreements. This is the case under the dispute settlement rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as well as under bilateral or regional dispute settlement mechanisms. The Union currently does not have a common legislative framework to enforce its rights under international trade agreements. However, it is essential that the Union possesses appropriate instruments to ensure the effective exercise of the Union's rights under international trade agreements, in order to safeguard its economic interests. This is particularly the case in situations where third countries enact restrictive trade measures that diminish the benefits accruing to the Union's economic operators under international trade agreements. The Union should be in a position to react swiftly and in a flexible manner in the context of the procedures and deadlines set out by the international trade agreements which it has concluded. Prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Union approached enforcement in an ad hoc manner in the form of Regulations adopted by the Council on the basis of a Commission proposal. After the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Council and the European Parliament are co-legislators under the ordinary legislative procedure in relation to the measures defining the framework for implementing the common commercial policy. Enforcement of rights under international trade agreements is a typical executive function that may require adopting and implementing measures within strict deadlines. It is appropriate for the Council and the European Parliament to establish a clear and predictable framework for the adoption of any such acts. The present proposal reflects the Union's priority to enforce effectively its trade rights. This objective was set out in the Commission Communication on "" Trade, growth and world affairs "" and endorsed in the Council conclusions of 21 December 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Regulation must be adopted at Union level. The common commercial policy is an exclusive competence of the Union. CONTENT: this draft Regulation proposes the creation of a common legislative framework to enforce the Union's rights under international trade agreements, in line with the Treaty of Lisbon. It lays down rules and procedures in order to ensure an effective exercise of the Union's rights to suspend or withdraw concessions or other obligations under international trade agreements, with the aim of: responding to breaches by third countries of international trade rules which affect the interests of the Union, with a view to seeking a satisfactory solution; rebalancing concessions or other obligations in the trade relations with third countries, when the import treatment accorded to goods from the Union is altered. Its objective is efficient and swift implementation with a view to safeguarding the Union's interest. Accordingly, on the basis of Article 207 of the TFEU, it proposes to empower the Commission to adopt, suspend, modify or terminate implementing acts to enforce the Union's rights within the structure of the Treaty of Lisbon, i.e. in accordance with Article 291 of the TFEU. The scope of the Regulation extends to the adoption, suspension, modification and termination of implementing acts with regard to: enforcement of the Union's rights under binding multilateral and bilateral dispute settlement rules; rebalancing measures under multilateral and bilateral safeguard rules; rebalancing measures in cases of modifications by a third country of its concessions under Article XXVIII GATT 1994. Conditions and criteria : implementing acts shall respect the rule that the level of countermeasures should not exceed the level of nullification and impairment, generally intended as the adverse impact on the Union resulting from the third country measure, as defined in the relevant agreement. In determining the scope of the implementing act to be adopted, the Commission shall also rely on various criteria, such as: (i) the effectiveness of the measures in inducing compliance of third countries with international trade rules; (ii) the potential of the measures to provide relief to economic operators within the Union affected by third country measures; (iii) availability of alternative sources of supply for the products concerned, in order to avoid or minimise any negative impact on downstream industries or final consumers within the Union. Types of measures : under the present draft Regulation, the Commission may adopt the following types of commercial policy measures: customs duties, quantitative restrictions on imports or exports of goods, and measures in the area of public procurement. Due to the particularities of public procurement, in particular the existence of an administrative procedure that regulates and determines access to specific calls for tenders, it is possible to envisage action as regards the procurement of both goods and services. In this regard, the type of commercial policy measures that may be enacted concern the exclusion from public procurement of tenders the total value of which represents more than 50% of goods or services originating in the third country concerned. A review clause provides that the Commission shall assess the operation of this Regulation three years after the first instance of its implementation occurred. The Commission shall issue a report and, if the circumstances so warrant, may propose appropriate measures to improve the Regulation’s efficiency. In this context, consideration can be given to the range of commercial policy measures under the Regulation such as trade in services and intellectual property rights, in addition to goods."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the current EU regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices ('IVDs') consists of Directive 98/79/EC. It has demonstrated its merits but has also come under criticism in recent years. In an internal market with 32 participating countries and subject to constant scientific and technological progress, substantial divergences in the interpretation and application of the rules have emerged, thus undermining the main objectives of the Directive, i.e. the safety and performance of IVDs and their free movement. Triggered Resolution on defective silicone gel breast implants this revision of the current regulatory framework aims to overcome the flaws and gaps and to further strengthen patient safety. It aims to put in place a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that is 'fit for purpose'. The framework is supportive of innovation and the competitiveness of the in vitro diagnostic medical device industry and should allow rapid and cost-efficient market access for innovative IVDs to the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals. It should be noted that this proposal is adopted alongside a proposal for a Regulation on medical devices that are currently covered by the AIMDD and the MDD. While the specific features of IVDs and of the IVD sector require the adoption of a specific legislation distinct from the legislation on other medical devices, the horizontal aspects common to both sectors have been aligned. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : to a large extent, the scope of the proposed Regulation matches the scope of Directive 98/79/EC, i.e. it covers in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The proposed changes clarify and extend the scope of the IVD Directive. They concern: ·  high-risk devices manufactured and used within a single health institution, which are subject to most of the requirements set out in the proposal; ·  tests providing information about the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease (e.g. genetic tests) and tests providing information to predict treatment response or reactions (e.g. companion diagnostics), which are considered as in vitro diagnostic medical devices; ·  medical software, which is explicitly mentioned in the definition of IVDs. To support Member States and the Commission in determining the regulatory status of products, the Commission may set up, in accordance with its internal rules, a group of experts from various sectors (such as IVDs, medical devices, medicinal products, human tissues and cells, cosmetics and biocides). Definitions: this section has been significantly extended, aligning the definitions in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices with well-established European and international practice. Making available of devices, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement: t his chapter covers mainly horizontal issues similar for both medical devices and IVDs. It contains provisions that are typical for product-related internal market legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives of non-EU manufacturers, importers and distributors). It also provides clarification with regard to the adoption and the scope of common technical specifications (CTS) for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The legal obligations on manufacturers are proportionate to the risk class of the devices they produce. The following concepts are new in the field of IVDs: ·  a requirement has been introduced that within the manufacturer's organisation a 'qualified person' should be responsible for regulatory compliance. Similar requirements exist in EU legislation on medicinal products and in the national laws transposing the Directive on medical devices in some Member States. ·  since in the case of 'parallel trade' with in vitro diagnostic medical devices application of the principle of free movement of goods varies considerably from one Member State to another and, in many cases, de facto prohibits this practice, clear conditions are set for enterprises involved in relabelling and/or repackaging IVDs. Identification and traceability of devices, registration of devices and of economic operators, summary of safety and performance, Eudamed: this chapter addresses one of the main shortcomings of the current system: its lack of transparency. It consists of the following requirements: Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for notified bodies. It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies, based on stricter and detailed criteria laid down in Annex VI, with the individual Member State . Any new designation and, in regular intervals, the monitoring of notified bodies are made subject to 'joint assessments' with experts from other Member States and the Commission, thus ensuring an effective control at Union level. At intervals. Classification and conformity assessment : the proposal introduces a new risk-rule based classification system, built on GHTF principles, which replaces the current list of IVD medical devices in Annex II to Directive 98/79/EC. In the new classification system, IVDs will be divided into four classes of risk : A (lowest risk), B, C and D (highest risk). The conformity assessment procedures have been adapted to match each of these four device classes. The proposal tightens and streamlines the different conformity assessment procedures during which the notified body audits the manufacturer's quality management system, checks the technical documentation, examines the design dossier or approves the type of a device. These are laid down in Annexes VIII to X. One conformity assessment procedure provided for under the IVD Directive (EC verification) has been deleted and the concept of batch testing has been clarified. The proposal also: ·  Clinical evidence: the proposal spells out the requirements for clinical evidence for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that are proportionate to the risk class. The key obligations are set out in Chapter VI while more detailed provisions are laid down in Annex XII. While most clinical performance studies follow an observational design and therefore the results obtained are not used for patient management and do not impact treatment decisions, specific requirements have been introduced in Annex XIII for the conduct of interventional clinical performance studies and other clinical performance studies where the conduct of the study, including specimen collection, involves invasive procedures or other risks for the subjects of the studies. The concept of 'sponsor' is introduced. The scope of the proposal remains restricted to clinical performance studies carried out for regulatory purposes, i.e. for obtaining or confirming regulatory approval for market access. Non-commercial clinical performance studies that do not pursue a regulatory purpose are not covered by this Regulation. Every interventional clinical performance study and other clinical performance study involving risks for the subjects of the study shall be registered in a publicly accessible electronic system which the Commission will set up. Vigilance and market surveillance : Governance : a central role in achieving harmonised interpretation and practice will be assigned to an expert committee (the Medical Device Coordination Group or MDCG) made up of members appointed by the Member States due to their role and experience in the fields of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices and set up by Regulation on medical devices. The proposal mandates the Commission to provide technical, scientific and logistic support to the MDCG. It empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, either implementing acts to ensure uniform application of this Regulation, or delegated acts to complement the regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices over time. The future Regulation will replace and repeal Directive 98/79/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Regulation (EU) No 691/2011). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: sound information on the key trends, pressures and drivers for environmental change is essential for the development of effective policy, its implementation, and the empowerment of citizens more generally. Users put much emphasis on analysis and applications of environmental accounts in modelling and outlooks, both for preparing policy proposals and reporting on policy implementation and impacts. Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts covers three modules: (i) air emissions accounts ; (ii) environmental taxes ; (iii) material flow accounts. It contains a list of possible new modules to be introduced later based on Commission proposals. In accordance with the Regulation, several such pilot studies have been completed which clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the three new modules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal has been discussed, in the framework of the European Statistical System, with data producers and users. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal of the amending act seeks to extend the coverage of Regulation 691/2011 to include the following additional modules: a module for environmental protection expenditure accounts; a module for environmental goods and services sector accounts; a module for physical energy flow accounts. These three new modules contribute directly to the Union's policy priorities of green growth and resource efficiency by providing important information on indicators such as market output and employment in the EGSS, national environmental protection expenditure and the use of energy in a detailed NACE breakdown. No new data collection is necessary for implementing the new modules. The United Nations Statistical Commission has adopted the System of Environmental- Economic Accounting (SEEA) as an international statistical standard at its 43rd session in February 2012. The new modules proposed are fully in line with the revised European Strategy for Environmental Accounting (ESEA 2008). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no new implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is the biggest donor of official development aid (ODA) in the world, providing more than half of all aid given worldwide. Its strong commitment to supporting partner countries dates back to 1957, when the Treaties of Rome first established a European development policy. Despite this strong commitment to supporting partner countries, EU citizens often lack information on development cooperation, why it is needed and on the added value of development policies at EU level. The October 2012 Eurobarometer survey highlighted significant areas of ignorance, with 53 % of respondents indicating that they know nothing about where EU aid goes (44 % are unaware of where their country’s bilateral aid goes). It is important to raise European citizens’ awareness of global interdependence. People need information as to how an outward-looking Europe can help to ensure global sustainability. Against this background, The EYD2015 is an opportunity to improve the level of information in all Member States IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in October 2012, the European Parliament called on the Commission to make 2015 the European Year for Development, expressing its hope that this would raise the profile of development cooperation. The Commission services and the External Action Service have been informally consulted on the idea of the EYD2015. The European Parliament and Member States have been informally contacted on the organisation of the EYD2015 . Furthermore, the issue is on the agenda for the regular meeting with Member States’ Directors-General responsible for development in June 2013. Given the external relations dimension of the EYD2015, informal discussions have also taken place with international organisations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209 and Article 210(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposed Decision is to establish a European Year of Development in 2015. Objectives : the general purpose of the European Year shall be: to inform EU citizens about EU development cooperation, highlighting what the European Union can already achieve as the biggest aid donor in the world; to stimulate the active interest of European citizens in development cooperation and foster a sense of responsibility and opportunity as regards their participation in policy formulation and implementation; and to raise awareness of the role of EU development cooperation. Initiatives involved : the proposal presents the measures taken to achieve the objectives. These may include the following initiatives organised at Union, national, regional or local level: communication campaigns to disseminate key messages targeted at the general public and more specific audiences, including through social media; the organisation of conferences, events and initiatives with all relevant stakeholders, to promote active participation and debate, and to raise awareness at European level; concrete initiatives in the Member States aimed at promoting the objectives of the European Year, in particular through the exchange of information and sharing of experience and good practices among national, regional, local administrations and other organisations; and undertaking studies and surveys and disseminating their results. A detailed Annex outlines the actions proposed and the operational means as to how the objectives may be achieved. 3 different types of actions are laid down: direct Union initiatives; co-financing Union initiatives; co-financing Member States’ initiatives. The Commission may identify other activities as contributing to the objectives of the European Year and may allow references to the European Year to be used in promoting those activities, insofar as they contribute to achieving the objectives of the Decision. Coordination with Member States : each Member State is invited to appoint a national coordinator to be responsible for organising its involvement in the European Year, and shall inform the Commission of that appointment. The national coordinators shall, in close coordination with the Commission, consult and cooperate with a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including civil society, national parliaments, social partners and, where appropriate, the national agencies or contact points for the relevant Union programmes. By 1 June 2014, Member States are invited to transmit to the Commission their proposed work programme, which shall set out details of the national activities planned for the European Year of Development. Participating countries : participation in the activities of the European Year to be financed shall be open to: (i) Member States; (ii) candidate countries benefiting from a pre-accession strategy. Coordination at Union level and implementation : the Commission shall implement this Decision at the level of the Union, in particular by adopting the necessary financing decisions in accordance with the Regulations establishing the Financing Instruments relevant to the actions concerned. It shall cooperate closely with Member States, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the bodies and associations active in development issues. The Commission shall make the theme of the European Year a priority in the communication activities of its Representations in the Member States and the European Union Delegations in partner countries. Consistency and complementarity : the Commission shall ensure that the measures provided for in this Decision are consistent with any other Union, national and regional schemes and initiatives that help attain the objectives of the European Year. Specific provisions on financial and non-financial support : measures are provided to define the mode of access to financing of measures related to the European Year (depending on the case, procurement or the award of grants financed from the general budget of the Union. Non-financial support may be granted by the Commission for activities undertaken by public and private organisations which comply with certain conditions laid down in the Decision (use of the logo etc). Measures are provided as regards the protection of the Union’s financial interests and the fight against fraud. Monitoring and evaluation : by 31 December 2016, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in this Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: no additional funding is sought for the European Year of Development. The flexibility for annual priority settings based on the budget lines and programmes of the Communication provides sufficient margin for running the Year on a EUR 15 million scale. For 2013 and 2014, the amounts under management of DG DEVCO amount to EUR 14.20 million enabling the financing of the operational activities of the European Year."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2001 International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly endorsed the application of open emissions trading systems to international aviation. The Union is endeavouring to secure a future international agreement to control greenhouse gas impacts from aviation and, in the meantime, is limiting climate change impacts from aviation activities to and from aerodromes in the Union by autonomous action. In line with the outcome of the 38th ICAO Assembly held in September 2013, there should be a single global market-based measure (MBM) applying to international aviation emissions from 2020 onwards. In response to this progress and to promote further momentum towards the successful establishment of a global MBM, the Commission proposes to make amendments to the aviation activities covered by the EU ETS. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment has shown that adapting the EU ETS to accord with what was expected to be ICAO's MBM Resolution for the period up to 2020 is feasible at low administrative costs. The environmental benefit of this proposal comes from two key elements: it gives impetus to the global MBM that will cover the total emissions from international aviation from 2020 onwards. Depending on the ambition level agreed for the global MBM, total international aviation emissions will be capped at their 2020 level and even be halved by 2050 below 2005 levels; the EU ETS will continue to achieve substantial emission reductions that are expected to be up to 250 million tons CO2 in the period from 2013 to 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposed amending the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) so that aviation emissions would be covered for the part of flights that takes place in European regional airspace. The adjustment in the legislation would apply from 1 January 2014 and until a planned global market-based mechanism (MBM) becomes applicable to international aviation emissions by 2020. The key features of the revised ETS system resulting from this proposal would be as follows: flights between aerodromes in the EEA remain fully covered, as under the original Directive and Decision No. 377/2013/EU; flights to and from third countries which are not developed countries and which emit less than 1% of global aviation emissions would be exempted; fights to and from third countries are responsible for emissions taking place not beyond EEA countries, as from 2014. A simplified procedure is proposed to determine the relevant proportion of emissions of a given flight which is covered by the ETS; overflights of EEA countries are exempt, as are emissions from flights between airports in third countries and EEA airports as regards European dependencies and territories, and flights to and from EEA airports and those territories. As a simplification and to in order to lighten administrative tasks for the smallest aircraft operators, the proposal provides that action should not be taken against non-commercial aircraft operators in respect of emissions from small aircraft operators emitting less than 1000 tonnes CO2 per annum. This is expected to reduce the number of aircraft operators regulated by Member States by around 2200 representing 0.2% of emissions. All other obligations in respect of flights remain unaffected. The Commission calls for this proposal to be adopted rapidly by the European Parliament and Council, so as to provide clarity for aircraft operators, who would otherwise have to surrender allowances. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: connected technologies account for 50% of productivity gains in recent years across all sectors. The Commission considers that they are the key for Europe to emerge stronger from the crisis, if impediments to growth arising from ongoing fragmentation are addressed. After over a decade of Union legislative interventions to liberalise and integrate the telecommunications market, Europe is fragmented into 28 separate national communications markets, each with a limited number of players. This patchy scenario raises barriers to entry and increases the costs for operators wanting to provide cross-border services thereby impeding their expansion. EU rules on, for example, authorisations, regulatory conditions, spectrum assignment and consumer protection are implemented in diverging ways. As a consequence, while no operator is present in more than half of the Member States, most in far fewer, overall more than 200 operators serve a market of 510 million of customers. This stands in stark contrast with the US or China who have one single market of 330 and 1400 million customers respectively, served by four to five large operators, with one legislation, one licensing system, and one spectrum policy. The untapped potential of an EU single market in electronic communications is estimated at up to 0.9% GDP, or EUR 110 billion per year. The benefits from a single market for business communication services alone amount to almost EUR 90 billion per year. In the wider economy, increasing ICT investment, improving e-skills in the labour force and reforming the conditions for the Internet economy could boost GDP by an additional 5% up to 2020, and create 3.8 million jobs. The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), one of the flagship initiatives of Europe 2020 Strategy, has already recognised the role of ICT and network connectivity as an indispensable basis for the development of our economy and society. The 2013 Spring European Council stressed the importance of the digital single market for growth and called for concrete measures, in order to establish a single market in information and communications technology (ICT) as early as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in order to tackle these sources of fragmentation, three policy options were selected for further analysis: option 1 was based on the regulatory framework for electronic communications as it stands; option 2 considered a single legislative instrument (a Regulation) adjusting the regulatory framework only where necessary for a single EU market for electronic communications, based on enhanced EU coordination; option 3 included the substance of the second option, but replaced the current governance structure by a single EU regulator in order to achieve full regulatory coordination. The impact assessment report concludes that the second option is the best available. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the general objective of the proposal is to move towards a single market for electronic communications in which: citizens and businesses can access electronic communications services wherever they are provided in the Union, without cross-border restrictions or unjustified additional costs; companies providing electronic communications networks and services can operate and provide them wherever they are established or their customers are situated in the EU. The proposal builds upon and advances the main directives of 2002 governing the provision of electronic communications, as amended in 2009, by introducing directly applicable legislative provisions which shall operate in conjunction with the provisions of the directives on subjects such as authorisation, spectrum assignment and access to networks. The main elements of this proposal are as follows: A single EU authorisation mechanism : operators wanting to provide services in several Member States must currently be authorised in each of them. The proposed Regulation introduces a single EU authorisation based on a single notification system in the Member State of main establishment of the European electronic communication provider (the home country) and sets out the conditions applicable to it. European inputs : mobile providers in Europe today lack the necessary predictability regarding spectrum availability across the EU and must deal with diverging assignment conditions. It is thus more difficult to plan long-term, to invest across borders and eventually to gain scale. Such a patchy situation means that device manufacturers design their products for other markets with greater scale and growth prospects. To put an end to this unsustainable situation, harmonisation of spectrum inputs must be ensured by: guaranteeing mobile operators predictable assignment conditions and coordinated timeframes to access spectrum for wireless broadband across the EU; harmonising ways to access European fixed networks so that providers can more easily offer their services across the single market. The proposal also ensures harmonised, high-quality virtual access to fixed networks would facilitate market entry and the provision of cross-border services both to end-users and businesses, and would help drive competition and investment. Rights of end-users : t o guarantee an appropriate level of consumer protection across the EU, rules defining the rights of end-users are harmonised, including: non-discrimination between certain domestic and intra-EU (international) communications (unless differences are objectively justified); mandatory pre-contractual and contractual information; increased transparency and facilities to avoid ""bill shocks""; the right to terminate the contract after six months without costs (excluding the residual value of any subsidised equipment or other promotions); the obligation on providers to provide unhindered connection to all content, applications or services being accessed by end-users – also referred to as Net Neutrality - while regulating the use of traffic management measures by operators in respect of general internet access. At the same time, the legal framework for specialised services with enhanced quality is clarified. Facilitating change of provider : the proposal provides for harmonised principles applicable to switching procedures are provided, such as cost-orientation, receiving provider-led process, automatic termination of contract with the transferring provider. This proposal, together with the Commission Recommendation on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing methodologies to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment environment, forms a set of balanced measures aimed at moving towards a Single Market in Telecommunications and fostering investment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal h as no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: building trust in the online environment is key to economic development. The existing EU legislation, namely Directive 1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures, essentially covers electronic signatures only. There is no comprehensive EU cross-border and cross-sector framework for secure, trustworthy and easy-to-use electronic transactions that encompasses electronic identification, authentication and signatures. The Digital Agenda for Europe identifies existing barriers to Europe’s digital development and proposes legislation on e-signatures and the mutual recognition of eIdentification and authentication, establishing a clear legal framework so as to eliminate fragmentation and the lack of interoperability, enhance digital citizenship and prevent cybercrime. Legislation ensuring the mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication across the EU is also a key action in the Single Market Act, as well as the Roadmap for Stability and Growth. The European Parliament stressed the importance of the security of electronic services, especially of electronic signatures, and of the need to create a public key infrastructure at pan-European level, and called on the Commission to set up a European validation authorities gateway to ensure the cross-border interoperability of electronic signatures and to increase the security of transactions carried out using the internet. The aim of this proposal is to enhance existing legislation and to expand it to cover the mutual recognition and acceptance at EU level of notified electronic identification schemes and other essential related electronic trust services. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three sets of policy options were assessed, dealing respectively with (1) the scope of the new framework, (2) the legal instrument and (3) the level of supervision required. The preferred policy option proved to be enhancing legal certainty, boosting coordination of national supervision, ensuring mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification schemes and incorporating essential related trust services. The impact assessment concluded that doing this would lead to considerable improvements to legal certainty, security and trust in terms of cross-border electronic transactions, resulting in less fragmentation of the market. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed regulation seeks to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of public and private online services, e-business and electronic commerce in the EU. The main points of the proposal are as follows: 1) Electronic identification : the proposal provides for the mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification means falling under a scheme, which will be notified, to the Commission on the conditions laid down in the Regulation. It does not oblige Member States to introduce or notify electronic identification schemes, but to recognise and accept notified electronic identifications for those online services where electronic identification is required to get access at national level. Electronic identification schemes shall be eligible for notification if all five of the following conditions are met: ·  the electronic identification means are issued by, on behalf of or under the responsibility of the notifying Member State; ·  the electronic identification means can be used to access at least public services requiring electronic identification in the notifying Member State; ·  Member States must ensure an unambiguous link between the electronic identification data and the person concerned; ·  the notifying Member State ensures the availability of an authentication possibility online, at any time and free of charge. No specific technical requirements, such as hardware or software can be imposed on the parties relying on such authentication; ·  Member States must accept liability for the unambiguity of the link (i.e. that the identification data attributed to the person are not linked to any other person) and the authentication possibility (i.e. the possibility to check the validity of the electronic identification data). The proposal also aims to ensure the technical interoperability of the notified identification schemes through a coordination approach, including delegated acts. 2) Trust services : the proposal sets out the principles relating to the liability of both non-qualified and qualified trust service providers. It builds on Directive 1999/93/EC and extends entitlement to compensation of damage caused by any negligent trust service provider for failure to comply with security good practices which result in a security breach which has a significant impact on the service. It also describes the mechanism for the recognition and acceptance of qualified trust services provided by a provider established in a third country. 3) Supervision : the proposal (i) requires Member States to establish supervisory bodies, clarifying and enlarging the remit of the latter with regard to both trust service providers and qualified trust service providers; (ii) introduces an explicit mechanism of mutual assistance between supervisory bodies in Member States to facilitate the cross-border supervision of trust service providers; (iii) introduces an obligation for both qualified and non-qualified trust service providers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for the security of their activities ; (iv) sets out the conditions for the supervision of qualified trust service providers and qualified trust services provided by them ; (v) provides for the establishment of trusted lists containing information on qualified trust service providers who are subject to supervision and to the qualified services they offer. 4) Electronic signature : the proposal enshrines the rules related to the legal effect of natural persons’ electronic signatures, introducing an explicit obligation to give to qualified electronic signatures the same legal effect as handwritten signatures. Furthermore, Member States must ensure the cross-border acceptance of qualified electronic signatures, in the context of the provision of public services. The proposal also sets out: the requirements for qualified signature certificates and the requirements for qualified electronic signature creation devices; the conditions for qualified validation services, and the condition for the long-term preservation of qualified electronic signatures. 5) Electronic seals : the provisions concern the legal effect of electronic seals of legal persons. A specific legal presumption is bestowed on a qualified electronic seal which guarantees the origin and integrity of electronic documents to which it is linked. 6) Electronic time stamp : a specific legal presumption is bestowed on qualified electronic time stamps with regard to the certainty of the time. 7) Electronic documents : there is a specific legal presumption of the authenticity and integrity of any electronic document signed with a qualified electronic signature or bearing a qualified electronic seal. With regard to the acceptance of electronic documents, when an original document or a certified copy is required for the provision of a public service, at the least electronic documents issued by the persons who are competent to issue the relevant documents and that are considered to be originals or certified copies in accordance with national law of the Member State of origin, shall be accepted in other Member States without additional requirements. 8) Website authentication: the proposal ensures that the authenticity of a website with respect to the owner of the site will be guaranteed. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: EUR 9 408 million for the period 2014-2020 (human resources). The specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Commission. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since 1984, EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit when a directive (Directive 1984/253/EEC) harmonised the procedures for the approval of auditors. Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, was adopted in 2006 and considerably broadened the scope of the former Directive. The financial crisis has highlighted weaknesses in the statutory audit especially with regard to Public-Interest Entities (PIE), such as banks insurance companies and listed companies. Given that many banks revealed huge losses from 2007 to 2009 on the positions they had held both on and off balance sheet, it is difficult for many citizens and investors to understand how auditors could give clean audit reports to their clients (in particular banks) for those periods. Statutory auditors and audit firms play an important role in society. They are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits of public-interest entities with a view to enhancing the degree of confidence of the public in the annual and consolidated financial statements of such entities. In view of the public interest, better audit quality would contribute to the orderly functioning of markets by enhancing the integrity and efficiency of financial statements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment resulted in the following preferred policy options: · the scope of statutory audit should be clarified and specified and the information that the auditor provides to users, the audited entities, audit committees and supervisors improved; · the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services to the audited entities and even the prohibition of the provision of non-audit services in general would effectively address the need to reinforce independence and professional scepticism. Moreover, stricter rules in the procedure for the appointment of auditors and the introduction of mandatory audit firm rotation would contribute to higher quality audits; · in order to facilitate an objective choice of an audit provider, contractual clauses limiting audit firm choice should be prohibited, the transparency on audit quality and on audit firms should be increased and an audit quality certification should be established; · ownership restrictions should be lifted in order to increase the choice of audit providers; · national audit supervisory authorities should be strengthened and an EU-wide cooperation within the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should be set up. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal lays down conditions for carrying out the statutory audit on the financial statements of PIEs. Directive 2006/43/EC already deals with certain requirements which apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. Those requirements will no longer be comprised in the Directive, but integrated (and further developed) in this Regulation. The main points are as follows: Conditions for carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities : · an auditor should establish adequate policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Regulation regarding independence, internal quality control systems and the supervision of employees; · former auditors, key audit partners or their employees are not allowed to take up a key management position in the audited entity, to become a member of the audit committee of the audited entity, to become a non-executive member of the administrative body or to join the supervisory body of the audited entity within two years after the termination of the audit engagement; · the statutory auditor, audit firm or member of the audit firm's network will be prevented from providing certain non-audit services to their audited entities. For other non-services that are not fundamentally incompatible with the audit services, the audit committee or the competent authority will be empowered to assess whether or not they may be provided to the audited entity; · audit firms of significant size should focus their professional activity on the carrying out of statutory audit and should not be allowed to undertake non- audit services; · the content of the audit report disclosed to the public is expanded so that it: (i) explains the methodology used, especially how much of the balance sheet has been directly verified and how much has been based on system and compliance testing, the levels of materiality applied to perform the audit, the key areas of risk of material misstatements of the financial statements; (ii) explains whether the statutory audit was designed to detect fraud and, (iii) in the event of a qualified or adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, explain the reasons for such a decision; · the auditor should also prepare a longer and more detailed report for the audit committee. This report would provide more detailed information on the audit carried out, on the situation of the undertaking as such (e. g. going concern) and the findings of the audit combined with the necessary explanations; · the auditor should keep certain documents and information for a period of five years. The appointment of statutory auditors or audit firms by public-interest entities: · in order to reinforce the independence and capacity of the audit committee, the latter should be composed of non-executive members, at least one member should have experience and knowledge in auditing and another one in accounting and/or auditing; · the proposal for the appointment of the auditor to the meeting of shareholders should be based on a recommendation of the audit committee. Unless it concerns the renewal of an audit engagement, the recommendation should contain at least two choices (excluding the incumbent auditor) and the audit committee should express a justified preference for one of them. The recommendation of the audit committee should be made after the completion of a due tendering process; · the proposal introduces mandatory rotation of audit firms after a maximum period of 6 years that may be, under certain exceptional circumstances, extended to 8 years; · where a public-interest entity has appointed two or more statutory auditors or audit firms, the maximum duration of the engagements will be 9 years; on an exceptional basis, such duration may be extended to 12 years. It also provides for a cooling-off period before the audit firm is able to carry out the statutory audit of the same entity again. Surveillance of the activities of auditors and audit firms carrying out statutory audit of public-interest entities: · each Member State should designate a competent authority responsible for the supervision of auditors and audit firms auditing PIEs. The proposal requires that the EU-wide cooperation between competent authorities takes place within ESMA; · a 'voluntary' pan-European audit quality certification is introduced to increase the visibility, recognition and reputation of all audit firms having capacities to conduct high quality audits of PIEs. ESMA should publish the requirements for obtaining the certificate along with any administrative and fee implications. Supervisory measures and penalties: administrative pecuniary sanctions on auditors and PIEs for identified violations are envisaged. Authorities should be transparent about the sanctions and measures they apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no direct or indirect impact on the European Union budget. In particular, tasks that would be entrusted to EU supervisory bodies as mentioned in the proposal would not entail additional EU funding. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUD: in a crisis where EUR 4 588.9 billion of taxpayer money was committed to support banks between October 2008 and October 2009 and where such aid accounted for 39% of EU 27 GDP in 2009, all components of the financial system need to be improved. Robust audit is key to re-establishing trust and market confidence. It contributes to investor protection by providing easily accessible, cost-effective and trustworthy information about the financial statements of companies. It also potentially reduces the cost of capital for audited companies by ensuring more transparency and reliability of financial statements. It is also important to stress that auditors are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits. EU rules have partially regulated statutory audit through Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts. However, the high degree of concentration in audit market and the multitude of approval procedures necessary to provide cross-border statutory audits prevent small and medium-sized audit firms from benefiting from the internal market. The following problems are examined: §  a high level of administrative burden resulting from fragmented national regulation; §  the provision of cross-border statutory audits is allowed only if an auditor passes an aptitude test and gets approved and registered in every Member State; §  a lack of common standards across the EU on audit practice, independence, internal control of audit firms; §  auditing standards do not take into account the size of the audited companies, in particular of SMEs; §  associated problems regarding supervision of non-PIEs. This proposal on amending Directive 2006/43/EC aims to improve the internal market on statutory audits. It will coexist with a proposal for a regulation on the specific requirements on the statutory audit of public-interest entities. The two proposals are part of the ongoing regulatory reform in various domains of the financial sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment concluded that the best options to improve the existing situation would be: §  facilitation of the cross-border recognition of audit providers' competence; §  streamlining of the standards on audit practice, independence and internal control of audit firms across the Union; §  adaptation of audit standards to the size of the audited entity by requesting Member States to ensure that a proportionate and simplified audit for SMEs is possible. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal contains amendments to the provisions on the approval and registration of auditors and audit firms, on the existing principles in Directive 2006/43/EC regarding professional ethics, professional secrecy, independence and reporting as well as the associated supervision rules that remain applicable for the audit of non-public-interest entities (non- PIEs). The main modifications to the Directive are: Articulation between the Directive and an additional legal instrument on specific requirements for the statutory audit of PIEs : the proposal deals with the applicability of the amended Directive to the statutory audit of PIEs. Certain provisions apply to statutory auditors and audit firms, irrespective of the type of audited entity. However, for the rest of the Articles of the Directive, the situation is different: clauses on independence and objectivity, audit fees, audit reporting, quality assurance, investigations and penalties would not apply to the statutory audit of PIEs. On these specific issues more detailed rules would be enacted in the Regulation. Definition of ""statutory audit"" in order to take account of the new Accountancy Directive : the new definition will continue to cover the instances where different Union legal texts impose an obligation on some undertakings to have their financial statements audited, depending on their legal form or on their activity. In order to guarantee the “unicity” of audit, the definition of ""statutory audit"" should also cover situations where Member States decide to impose an obligation on small undertakings to have their financial statements audited. Lastly, where a small undertaking decides voluntarily to have its financial statements audited, such audit should also be considered a statutory audit. Modification of the ownership rules : currently, the Directive requires that a majority of the voting rights in an audit firm is held by licensed accountant practitioners. This requirement is no longer stipulated in the proposed amendment and Member States are forbidden to require that a minimum of capital or of voting rights in an audit firm is held by statutory auditors or audit firms. However, the proposal maintains the existing requirement that a majority of the members of the administrative or management body of the audit firm are audit firms or statutory auditors. Passport for audit firms : the proposal for an amended Directive would allow audit firms to provide statutory audits in Member States other than the Member State in which they have been approved, provided that the key audit partner leading the audit is approved as an auditor in the Member State concerned. However, once approval is obtained in the home Member State, the host Member State may require some form of registration of audit firms from other Member States. Passport for statutory auditors and ""softening"" the conditions for a statutory auditor to be approved in a different Member State : the proposed modifications regarding the approval of statutory auditors from other Member States are aligned with the provisions of the Directive 2005/36 on the recognition of professional qualifications. §  The proposal would allow statutory auditors to provide cross-border statutory audit services on a temporary or occasional basis. The conditions set out in the Professional Qualifications Directive would apply, notably the obligation to communicate the intention to provide the services in question to the relevant competent authority. §  A Member State will be able to offer the statutory auditor who is approved in another Member State the choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test, if such auditor wants to set up a permanent establishment in that Member State. The test should be aimed at assessing the statutory auditor's knowledge of the laws and regulations of that Member State that are relevant for the carrying out of the statutory audit. §  During the adaptation period, which should be offered to the applicant as an alternative to the aptitude test, the statutory auditor would be allowed to conduct statutory audit in the Member State, other than the one in which he or she is approved, under the supervision of a local auditor. The length of the adaptation period is three years. Requirements to competent authorities to cooperate regarding educational requirements and aptitude test : in order to ensure more convergence of the educational qualifications of auditors at Union level, the competent national authorities in charge of the public oversight for statutory auditors must cooperate. Cooperation at Union level is also necessary to harmonise the requirements of the aptitude test. Auditing standards and audit reporting : the proposal requires Member States to ensure that statutory auditors and audit firms carry out audits in accordance with the international auditing standards. New rules regarding competent authorities : currently, the Directive requires Member States to organise a system of public oversight for statutory auditors and audit firms. The new amendment states that the competent authority responsible for public oversight will be a public authority that will be also responsible for approval, registration and quality assurance. The competent authority responsible for the public oversight may delegate some of its tasks to other authorities or bodies with regard to the approval and registration of the statutory auditors and audit firms. Such delegation must be subject to several conditions and the body that bears the ultimate responsibility is the competent authority. Prohibition of contractual clauses: the proposal prohibits clauses according to which a third party suggests, recommends or requires the audited entity to appoint a specific statutory auditor or audit firm. Special rules for the statutory audit of small and medium-sized undertakings : following the recent Commission proposal, small undertakings would no longer be required by EU law to have their financial statements audited, although Member States may still require it. However, the requirement will continue to apply to medium-sized undertakings. When medium-sized undertakings are audited pursuant to EU law, the amended Directive requires Member States to ensure that the way in which the auditing standards are applied are adapted to the dimension and scale of those undertakings.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the need to rapidly achieve the Banking Union to ensure financial stability and growth in the euro area as well as throughout the single market was underlined by the Commission in its communications entitled “A Roadmap towards a Banking Union” (September 2012) and “A blueprint for a deep and genuine economic and monetary union: Launching a European Debate” (November 2012). In March 2013, the European Council committed to complete the Banking Union via the following steps. the remaining legislative procedures to set up the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) conferring powers on the ECB to supervise Euro Area banks should be concluded as a priority; agreement should be reached in the summer of 2013 on how the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could, following the establishment of the SSM and a review of bank balance sheets including the definition of “legacy assets”, recapitalise banks directly; likewise, in summer 2013, agreement should be reached on the Commission’s proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms; lastly, the Commission’s proposal for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) together with appropriate and effective backstop arrangements should be examined as a matter of priority with the intention of adopting them during the current parliamentary cycle. It was agreed that the Banking Union would cover all Euro Area Member States and those non-Euro Area Member States that choose to join. As recognised by the European Council, in the Banking Union, bank supervision and resolution need to be exercised by the same level of authority. The same EU-wide single rulebook of prudential requirements 6 and rules on bank resolution will apply within the Banking Union and in all other Member States. The swift agreement on a Single Supervisory Mechanism in April 2012 has laid the ground for a Banking Union, as integral part of the Economic and Monetary Union. The Single Supervisory Mechanism is set to enter into force in mid-2014. The ECB will assume ultimate responsibility for the supervision of all Euro Area banks. The Single Resolution Mechanism meanwhile should commence operations in January 2015, when the Directive which will provide the rulebook governing bank resolution across the internal market is set to enter into force IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has taken into account the analysis carried out in the Impact Assessment conducted for the adoption of the proposal for Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms which assessed operational and legal aspects relevant to the establishment of a single resolution mechanism (SRM). With regard to the ability of the SRM to produce efficient decisions, it is considered that a central decision-making level will contribute to minimizing the costs of resolution both since it can attain significant advantages in terms of economies of scale over a network, and because it is instrumental to the enforceability and optimality of the resolution decision. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to preserve the integrity of the Member States banking markets participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) by the putting in place of a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to deal with failing banks. The SRM would permit the application of uniform rules to any bank in difficulty in a participating Member State and to proceed effectively towards the resolution of bank failures in such a way as to minimise the cost for the taxpayer and for the real economy. Structure of the SRM: the composition of the SRM ensures that its decision-making structures are legally sound and effective, including in times of crisis. The decision-making structures of the Single Resolution Mechanism include the Single Resolution Board, the national resolution authorities of participating Member States and the European Commission. The tasks of the SRM are shared between Single Resolution Board and the national resolution authorities. The European Commission will participate in the SRM only in so far as needed to perform specific tasks provided for in this proposed Regulation and in relation to State aid scrutiny under the Treaty. Resolution - operation and procedure: to ensure that all participating Member States have full confidence in the quality and impartiality of the bank resolution process, resolution decisions will be prepared and monitored centrally by a Single Resolution Board to ensure a coherent and uniform approach is applied. The objective of resolution is to ensure the continuity of the bank’s critical functions, to protect financial stability, to minimise reliance on taxpayers’ money, and to protect depositors. Resolution is triggered by means of the following process : the ECB, as bank supervisor, notifies that a bank is failing to Commission, to the Resolution Board and to the relevant national authorities and ministries; the Resolution Board assesses if there is a systemic threat and no private sector solution and, if so, the Resolution Board recommends to the Commission to initiate resolution; on the basis of the Resolution Board’s recommendations, or of its own initiative, the Commission will have the power to initiate the resolution procedure; in this case, it would also indicate to the Resolution Board the framework of the resolution tools that will be applied in each case and on the use of the Fund; the national resolution authorities execute the resolution measures decided by the Board according to the national law. If the national resolution authorities do not comply with the decisions of the Board, the Board has the power to supersede the national resolution authorities and address certain decisions for the implementation of the resolution measures directly to the banks. Single Bank Resolution Fund: to support the resolution process and enhance its effectiveness, the proposed Regulation establishes a Single Bank Resolution Fund. This Fund will be able to pool significant resources from bank contributions and therefore protect taxpayers more effectively than national funds, while at the same time providing a level playing field for banks across participating Member States. The primary objective of the Single Resolution Fund is to ensure financial stability, rather than to absorb losses or provide capital to an institution under resolution. The Fund should not be considered as a bailout fund. On the basis of 2011 data on banks and an estimated amount of covered deposits held in banks in the euro-area, the 1% target level for the Single Resolution Fund would correspond to around EUR 55 billion. A transitional period of 10 years is foreseen before the Fund reaches its full target level. If no disbursements are made from the Fund during the initial build-up phase, the banking industry would annually contribute around one tenth of the target amount or in absolute terms around EUR 5.5 billion. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Resolution Board will be fully financed from contributions from the financial institutions. Around 6 000 Eurozone banks, in addition to their annual contributions to the Single Bank Resolution Fund, will pay a fixed pro rata of this amount to fully cover the Boards’ budgetary expenses. However, there will be some minor implications on the Union’s budget in the start-up phase of the Board. The incidence on the Commission’s administrative expenditure is estimated at EUR 10.575 million for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (repealing Directive 2006/87/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes harmonised conditions for issuing technical certificates for inland waterway vessels throughout the Union's inland waterway network. The technical requirements for vessels navigating on the Rhine river are established by the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR). The technical requirements set out in the annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC for the most part incorporate the provisions laid down in the Rhine Vessels Inspection Regulations, in the version approved in 2004 by the CCNR. The conditions and technical requirements for issuing inland navigation certificates under Article 22 of the Revised Convention on the Navigation on the Rhine are updated regularly and are recognised as reflecting current technological developments. Maintaining two different set of rules , those for certificates issued pursuant to Article 22 of the Revised Convention on the Navigation on the Rhine and for the Union inland navigation certificate, does not ensure legal certainty and safety. In order to achieve harmonisation at Union level and to prevent distortions of competition and varying levels of safety, it is necessary that the same technical requirements for the whole of the Union's inland waterway network should be applied and updated regularly. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The interested parties generally welcomed the overall approach to revising governance in order to streamline updates of the technical standards for inland navigation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to adopt a uniform set of technical standards for inland navigation vessels. This would provide: (i) more legal certainty; (ii) ensure that technical adaptations to technical progress can be introduced within a reasonable time; (iii) ensure that high safety standards on all EU inland waterways are maintained; (v) promote innovation in the sector. In the context of Directive 2006/87/EC, the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels are laid down in annex II. The proposed Directive re-organises the content of the annexes so as to ensure that these only cover aspects of a technical or a procedural nature. Aspects referring to the decision-making mechanism are integrated into the main text of the Directive. This concerns mainly the following provisions: Equivalences and derogations : in order to accommodate alternative approaches, to promote innovation, to prevent unreasonable costs, to provide for an efficient process for issuing certificates or to take account of regional circumstances, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the authorisation of certain derogations to the technical requirements for specific craft, to approve classification societies and to approve additional or reduced technical requirements for vessels operating in certain zones which are not linked to the navigable inland waterways of another Member State. These powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Adaptation of the Annexes : the approach taken in this proposal is to delegate powers to the Commission in respect of adapting the annexes of this directive in light of scientific and technical progress or of developments in this area arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular that of the CCNR. In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts for adapting the annexes, including for modifying the models of documents set out in the annexes to this Directive and adopting or modifying administrative instructions. When adopting such delegated acts the Commission shall ensure that the technical requirements that have to be fulfilled for the issuance of the Union inland navigation certificate recognised for navigation on the Rhine comply with a level of safety equivalent to that required for the issuing of the certificate referred to in Article 22 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation. Technical inspections : the Union inland navigation certificate should be issued to a craft that passes a technical inspection carried out prior to the craft being put into service. This technical inspection should be used to check whether the craft complies with the technical requirements set out in this Directive. The competent authorities of the Member States should be entitled to carry out additional inspections at any time to verify that the craft's physical state matches the Union inland navigation certificates. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal h as no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. . ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fight against breach of customs legislation entails extensive exchange of information in the framework of cooperation both between Member States and between the latter and the Commission. While such cooperation has already been successful, a number of areas have been identified where further action is necessary, mainly as regards the functioning of the antifraud system in the customs field and the improvement of customs risk management at national and Union levels. There are several challenges. ·  Address loopholes in the existing systems for the detection of customs-related fraud : the Commission considers that the effectiveness of current measures might be improved if the relevant services are supported by systematic availability of high-quality and timely data on container movements (Container Status Messages - CSMs) carrying goods, imports, exports and transit at national and EU levels. ·  Enhance customs risk management and supply chain security at national and EU levels: there is a need to: (i) establish an equivalent level of customs controls for goods brought into/ taken out of the customs territory of the Union; (ii) introduce a Union-wide risk management framework to support a common approach. ·  Address delays in OLAF investigations : the documents supporting import and export declarations (invoice, certificate of origin, etc.) are no longer kept by customs administrations but by economic operators. Member States must first obtain this information from economic operators before transmitting the information to the Commission. Such a system is inefficient because it delays OLAF’s investigations. ·  Clarify the possibility of restricting visibility of data : the AFIS IT system is currently underused because Member States are not able to select the potential users of the information they insert in the system. Users would more readily share information that they possess within the AFIS system if they were able to shield sensitive data. ·  Streamline data protection supervision : it is necessary to have closer collaboration between the two supervisory bodies: the European Data Protection Supervisor – EDPS and Customs Joint Supervisory Authority – CJSA. Another issue in the area of data protection which needs to be further clarified is the responsibility for the technical systems established by the Commission. ·  Clarify the admissibility of evidence collected under mutual assistance : it appears necessary to clarify that the evidence obtained through mutual assistance may be used by prosecutors in the national criminal proceedings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of policy options concluded that the main amendments would comprise the following objectives: (i) create conditions for improved fighting of customs fraud related to misdeclaration of goods origin, misdescription of goods and misuse of the transit system; (ii) speed up OLAF investigations. The proposed options are in line with the fundamental rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) n° 515/97 so as to improve the detection, investigation and prevention of customs-related fraud, by increasing the exchange of information and the available evidence, and improving the functioning of the established system. Specifically, the proposal aims to: ·  update the concept of customs legislation, in order to have the terminology aligned with the customs field, adding references to entry and exit of goods; ·  remove the legal uncertainty that currently exists in relation to the possible use of information collected through mutual assistance as evidence in national criminal proceedings; ·  oblige carriers to supply the Commission with the information on container movements (i.e. Container Status Messages — CSMs); ·  create a central database for import and export data; ·  create a centralised repository for transit-related data; ·  enable the Commission to obtain directly from private sector operators documents supporting import and export declarations, in order to speed up OLAF’s investigations; ·  introduce the possibility of selecting the potential users of data (restricted visibility) so that Member States might increase the use of databases and consequently contribute to efficiency; ·  simplify and harmonise the rules for the supervision of data protection rules applicable to the EDPS and the CJSA. The proposal also introduces a maximum retention period of ten years for data stored in the CIS, stipulating that in cases where personal data are stored for a period exceeding five years, the EDPS should be informed accordingly. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary cost is estimated at EUR 60.526 million (including human resources and other administrative expenditure) for the period 2014-2020. The budgetary effort concerns mainly the IT costs to maintain and further develop the existing AFIS system. The costs related to the implementation of the proposal will be handled within the framework of the existing forecast in the context of Multiannual Financial Framework and therefore no additional request for budgetary allocation is required. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in line with its flagship initiative ‘ Resource-efficient Europe ”, the White Paper entitled “ Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a Competitive and Resource Efficient Transport System ” called for breaking the oil dependence of transport and set a target of 60% greenhouse gas emissions reduction from transport by 2050. The Commission therefore decided to develop a sustainable alternative fuels strategy, including also the appropriate associated infrastructure. The Commission’s communication “ Clean Power for Transport: A European alternative fuels strategy ” evaluates the main alternative fuel options available to substitute oil. The main alternative fuel options are electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, natural gas (in the forms of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), or GasTo-Liquid (GTL)), and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Lack of alternative fuel infrastructure and of the common technical specifications for the vehicle-infrastructure interface is considered a major obstacle to the market introduction of alternative fuels and consumer acceptance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment that accompanies the proposal investigated the situation with infrastructure for the main alternative fuel options. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims at ensuring the setting in place of alternative fuel infrastructure and the implementation of common technical specifications for this infrastructure in the Union. the introduction of common technical specifications and the establishment of minimum infrastructure for alternative fuels for transport, i.e. electricity, natural gas (CNG and LNG) and hydrogen, to ensure the market uptake by consumers of alternative fuels and the further development and deployment of the technology by industry; Member States to draw up national policy frameworks for the market development of alternative fuels and their infrastructure; each Member State to establish a minimum number of recharging points for electric vehicles by each Member State, with 10% of them being publicly accessible; the establishment, on the territory of Member States where there are already hydrogen refuelling points, the build-up of a sufficient number of points to allow hydrogen-powered vehicles to circulate throughout the national territory; that LNG refuelling points shall be built in all maritime and inland waterway ports, as well as routes on the Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Core Network and defines the common technical specifications to be met by this infrastructure; that common information on fuels and their compatibility with vehicles be made available to the consumer at the pumps in all refuelling points, in vehicle manuals, and on the vehicles themselves. BUDGETARY IMPACT: only limited costs related to the follow-up on the implementation of the Directive will arise for the EU budget. The total impact on expenditure (operational and administrative expenditure) is estimated at EUR 1 329 080 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Council Directive 96/53/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: it has become crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of petroleum products in the field of transport, and even more crucial for road transport, which accounts for 82% of the energy consumption of the transport sector. Furthermore, the steady rise in the price of fuel prompts the need to identify solutions to reduce vehicle fuel consumption. In the light of the evolving market and the technologies available, the question today is whether the choices made when the Directive was adopted in 1996 are still relevant. The White Paper on Transport Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system published in 2011 set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2050 in comparison with 1990 levels. In this context, the White Paper announced the revision of the 1996 Directive, with the aim of allowing more energy- efficient, aerodynamic vehicles to be put on the market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposed measures are the result of public and sectoral consultations held in 2011 and 2012 and organized by the Commission. They were examined in an impact assessment which looked at several options in terms of economic and environmental efficiency. The option selected combines technical harmonisation work conducted with a group of experts with a view to adopting delegated acts and a moderate regulatory approach, in order to avoid imposing disproportionate or inapplicable obligations, which would penalise small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Directive 96/53/EC to improve the aerodynamics of vehicles and their energy efficiency, while continuing to improve road safety, and within the limits imposed by the geometry of road infrastructures. Specifically, the proposal: grants derogations from the maximum dimensions of vehicles for the addition of aerodynamic devices to the rear of vehicles or to redefine the geometry of the cabs for tractors, improving drivers’ field of vision, and improving their safety and comfort. The Commission will, with the assistance of a Committee, specify these requirements at a later stage; authorises a weight increase of one tonne for vehicles with an electric or hybrid propulsion, to take account of the weight of batteries or the dual motorisation, without prejudice to the load capacity of the vehicle. Furthermore, the maximum weight of buses will be increased by a tonne to take account of various developments such as the increase in the average weight of passengers and their baggage, of new equipment imposed by the safety regulations, and the new Euro VI class; will facilitate the development of intermodal transport by allowing a derogation of 15 cm in the length of trucks carrying 45-foot containers, which are increasingly used in intercontinental and European transport; confirms that cross-border use of longer vehicles is lawful for journeys that only cross one border, if the two Member States concerned already allow it and if the conditions for derogations under the Directive are met; adds new provisions to enable the inspection authorities to better detect infringements and harmonise administrative penalties that apply to them. The Commission will publish guidelines on inspection procedures to ensure harmonisation of inspection methods between all Member States. The latter must carry out a minimum number of vehicle checks, using either weighing systems built into the road or by means of onboard sensors in vehicles that communicate remotely with roadside inspectors. The Commission will define the technical standards for onboard weighing devices that can communicate with the inspection authorities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. In order to accelerate the introduction of vehicles that are more aerodynamic and have hybrid motorisation, the Commission will use the budgets at its disposal, in particular those allocated to trans-European networks and the EU programmes for research, development and innovation, to help industrial research, and equipping vehicle fleets. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since the UCITS Directive was adopted in 1985, the rules relating to depositaries in the Directive have remained unchanged. These rules consist of a number of generic principles setting out the duties of depositaries. The Directive makes reference to national laws in respect of the precise contours of these duties. This leaves considerable scope for diverging interpretations regarding the scope of a depositary's duties and the liability for the negligent performance thereof. As a result, different approaches have developed across the European Union, leading to UCITS investors facing uneven levels of protection in different jurisdictions. The potential consequences of national divergences in the liability standard came to the fore following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the Madoff fraud. The Madoff case raised several important issues in relation to UCITS funds particularly regarding the precise conditions under which a depositary acting on behalf of a UCITS fund can delegate safekeeping of assets to a sub-custodian. The Madoff case also raises the issue of conflicts of interest. The Commission considers it necessary to amend Directive 2009/65/EC in order to take into account market developments and the experiences of market participants and supervisors gathered so far, in particular to address discrepancies between national provisions in respect of depositaries' duties and liability, remuneration policy and sanctions. This proposal forms part of a wider legislative package dedicated to rebuilding consumer trust in financial markets. The package has two other parts: ·  the first is an extensive overhaul of the Insurance Mediation Directive 2002/92/EC to ensure a high level of protection when buying insurance products; ·  the second part isa proposal for a regulation on key information documents on investment products, aiming at improving transparency in the investment market for retail investors. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on five issues. Its main conclusions are as follows: 1.  Eligibility to act as a depositary : both credit institutions and regulated investment firms provide sufficient guarantees in terms of prudential regulation, capital requirements and effective supervision to act as UCITS depositaries. Other institutions (such as law firms, notaries) are not deemed to provide these guarantees and would have, if they wished to act as UCITS depositaries, to transform themselves into regulated investment firms. As most UCITS depositaries are already credit institutions or regulated investment firms, the impact of the chosen option would thus only concern a small minority of unlicensed service providers. 2.  Delegation of custody: the delegation of custody should be governed by rules on diligence in selecting an appointing a sub-custodian, and on the ongoing monitoring of the activities of the sub-custodian. 3.  Liability: a 'strict liability' standard obliging depositaries to return instruments lost in custody irrespective of fault or negligence is both conducive to ensuring a high level of investor protection and to achieving a uniform standard across the EU. 4.  Remuneration: the proposal envisages introducing a requirement for the UCITS management company to implement remuneration policy that is consistent with sound risk management of the UCITS fund and complies with minimum remuneration principles. 5.  Sanctions: the policy choice is to achieve minimum harmonisation of the sanctions regime. This regime would apply to a catalogue of breaches of main investor protection safeguards in the UCITS Directive. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Directive 2009/65/EC on UCITS as regards depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. The main points of the proposal are as follows: Rules on depositaries’ duties : in relation to the depositary's core safekeeping and oversight duties, the draft proposes to amend the UCITS Directive in the following manner: ·  appointment of a single depositary for each UCITS fund in order to ensure that one fund cannot have several depositaries. The appointment of a depositary shall be evidenced by written contract; ·  making uniform a list of oversight duties of depositaries of UCITS established in a contractual form and UCITS established in a corporate form. These duties involve: (i) verifying compliance with applicable rules when UCITS shares are sold, issued, re-purchased, redeemed and cancelled; (ii) verifying that any consideration is remitted to it within the usual time limits; (iii) verifying that the investment company's income is applied in accordance with its instruments of incorporation, ensuring that the value of units in a UCITS is calculated in accordance with the applicable national law and the fund rules; (iv) and carrying out instructions of the management or investment company; ·  detailed provisions on cash monitoring in order to equip the depositary with a view over all the assets of the UCITS, cash included. The proposal also ensures that no cash account associated with the funds' transactions shall be opened without the depositary's knowledge. The aim is to avoid the possibility of fraudulent cash transfers. This paragraph also introduces a segregation requirement, so that any financial instruments on the depositary's book held for a UCITS can be distinguished from the depositary's own assets and can at all times be identified as belonging to that UCITS; ·  introduction of a distinction between (a) custodial duties relating to financial instruments that can be held in custody by the depositary and (b) verification of the ownership duties relating to the remaining types of assets; ·  introduction of a series of customary provisions on professional conduct, the avoidance of and the management of conflicts of interest. Rules on delegation: ·  the proposal defines the conditions in which the depositary’s safekeeping duties can be delegated to a sub-custodian (the conditions upon which a UCITS depositary may entrust its safekeeping duties to a third party are aligned with those applicable under the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive). Rules on eligibility to act as a UCITS custodian: ·  introduction of an exhaustive list of entities that are eligible to act as depositaries. The policy choice is to only allow credit institutions and investment firms to act as UCITS depositaries. Rules on liability: ·  clarification of the UCITS depositary's liability in case of the loss of a financial instrument that is held in custody. Where a financial instrument held in custody is lost, the UCITS depositary shall be under the obligation to return a financial instrument of the identical type or of the corresponding amount to the UCITS. No further discharge of liability in case of loss of assets is envisaged, except where the depositary can prove that the loss is due to an 'external event beyond its reasonable control'; ·  the depositary's liability is not affected by the fact that it has entrusted to a third party all or some of its custody tasks. As a result, the depositary is obliged to return instruments held in custody that are lost, even if the loss was incurred by the sub-custodian. Redress: ·  alignment of the rights of investors in both corporate and contractual UCITS so that they are able to invoke claims relating to the liabilities of depositaries, either directly or indirectly (through the management company), depending on the legal nature of the relationship between the depositary, the management company and the unit-holders. Remuneration: ·  the proposal reflects current policy on remuneration of senior management, risk takers and those who exercise control functions. These principles should also apply to those that manage a UCITS fund, be it managed in the form of an investment company or in the form of a management company. Access to telephone and data records: ·  competent authorities will be able to require existing telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunication operator or by a UCITS, a management company, an investment company or a depositary, where a reasonable suspicion exists that such records related to the subject-matter of the inspection may be relevant to prove a breach of the provisions of the UCITS Directive. Sanctions and measures: ·  a common approach to the main breaches of the UCITS Directive. The proposal sets out a list of the main breaches. It also lays down the administrative sanctions and measures that the competent authorities should be empowered to apply in case of the main breaches. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the lack of transparency and comparability of charges and the difficulty of switching bank accounts continue to figure as obstacles to a fully integrated internal market for retail banking. A survey conducted by Eurobarometer in 2012 showed that only 3% of the respondents declared having opened a payment account cross-border. Consumers were dissuaded from purchasing retail financial products cross-border by unclear information (21%), lack of clarity of the rights available to the consumer (18%) or the process being too complicated (15%). Surveys and complaints from consumers demonstrate that many citizens have faced difficulties in opening a payment account due to their lack of a permanent address in the Member State where the payment service provider is located. This problem affects a large number of EU consumers living in another Member State (12.3 million people in 2010). Furthermore, the World Bank estimated that about 58 million EU consumers do not have a payment account and approximately 25 million of them would like to open one. The fact that a large number of consumers does not currently participate in the internal market for financial services has negative consequences for both payment service providers and consumers. Initiatives have already been taken in these areas : (i) the Payment Service Directive (2007/64/EC) provides certain transparency obligations with respect to the fees charged by payment service providers; (ii) following a request from the Commission in 2010, the banking industry at EU level proposed to develop, through self-regulation, a framework ensuring increased transparency on payment account fees; (iii) in July 2011 the Commission issued a Recommendation on access to a basic payment account. However, progress remains limited. The Single Market Act II adopted on 3 October 2012, identified a legislative initiative on bank accounts in the EU as one of the twelve priority actions to generate real effects on the ground and make citizens and businesses confident to use the single market to their advantage. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission prepared an impact assessment of policy options. These options concerned: (i) the scope of the new provisions, (ii) the level of standardisation, (iii) the setting up and functioning of measures on transparency and comparability of fees, switching between payment accounts, improved access to basic payment services and (iv) how to ensure their effective application for consumers. Following an assessment of the available options, the Commission concluded that in order to improve the functioning of the switching process, it is necessary to enact measures to give binding legal force to the provisions of the Common Principles on account switching. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the draft directive aims to: (i) improve the transparency and comparability of fee information relating to payment accounts, (ii) facilitate switching between payment accounts, (iii) eliminate discrimination based on residency with respect to payment accounts and (iv) provide access to a payment account with basic features within the EU. The directive will apply to payment accounts held by consumers. Consequently, accounts held by businesses are outside its scope. It will not cover savings accounts. 1) Transparency on fees : the proposal requires payment service providers to provide consumers with: ·  a fee information document containing information on the most representative payment services in each Member State, using the terms and definitions established at EU level where relevant; ·  a glossary drafted in clear, unambiguous and non-technical language, containing at least the list of payment services and the related definitions; ·  information on all the fees charged on the account at least annually. Consumers should be able to access comparison websites obtain to obtain impartial information on bank fees. 2) Changing accounts: the proposal: ·  requires Member States enact a general obligation for payment service providers to make a switching service available to any consumer who holds an account with a payment service provider located in the Union; ·  establishes the specific roles and obligations for the receiving and transferring payment service providers in the context of the switching service; ·  establishes principles to guarantee that the charges related to the switching services are appropriate and in line with the costs incurred; ·  establishes the obligation for payment service providers to refund charges incurred by consumers due to their mistake or delay during the switching service. 3) Access to a bank account: the proposal: ·  requires Member States to ensure that consumers are not discriminated against on the basis of their nationality or residence when applying for a payment account or in their use of a payment account; ·  establishes a right of access to a basic payment account for consumers in any Member State; ·  requires Member States to designate at least one payment service provider to offer a basic payment account; ·  requires Member States to ensure that services are offered by payment service providers free of charge or for a reasonable fee. ·  recalls that Directive 2007/64/EC is applicable to payment accounts with basic features. However the proposal provides for a limited list of grounds that may justify the termination of the framework contract of a payment account with basic features by the payment service provider. Lastly, the proposal requires Member States: (i) to establish specific requirements for the settlement of disputes between consumers and payment service providers; (ii) to establish rules on sanctions for breaches of the national provisions adopted to implement the directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates - a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges - are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: road safety is one of the major elements of the European Union’s transport policy. In 2011 around 30 000 people were killed and more than 1.5 million injured in about 1.1 million traffic accidents on EU roads. In this context, eCall can significantly contribute to the reduction of road fatalities and alleviation of severity of road injuries. Therefore, the harmonised implementation of an interoperable EU-wide eCall service in the EU has been in the agenda of the Commission since 2005. Given the absence of any significant progress in the voluntary deployment of eCall by the end of 2009, the Commission decided to conduct an Impact Assessment in order to assess the most appropriate policy option to implement the EU-wide eCall service in Europe. The Commission unveiled on 8 September 2011 its strategy on regulatory measures for eCall, together with the adoption of the first part of this strategy, which consisted of a Commission Recommendation on support for an EU-wide eCall service in electronic communication networks for the transmission of in-vehicle emergency calls based on 112 (‘eCalls’). In its non-legislative resolution ‘report on eCall: a new 112 service for citizens’ adopted on 3 July 2012, the European Parliament stated that eCall should be a public EU-wide emergency call system, embedded in the vehicle and based on 112 and on common pan-European standards. It urged the Commission to submit a proposal within the framework of Directive 2007/46/EC in order to ensure the mandatory deployment of a public, 112-based eCall system by 2015 in all new type-approved cars and in all Member States’, On 26 November 2012, the Commission adopted the Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that the best option to implement eCall effectively is a ‘regulatory’ approach. eCall will then be based on the installation of type-approved equipment for the Single European Emergency Number 112 in all vehicles, starting with certain categories of vehicles, and a framework for handling eCalls in the telecommunication networks and PSAPs; the ability of mobile network operators to transmit messages in a certain format and, lastly, the capacity of the emergency call response centres (also known as PSAPs — Public Safety Answering Points) to handle these messages. The system can only be operational if all three parts are in operation simultaneously. The estimated costs of upgrading PSAPs average around EUR 1.1 million per Member State. reduction in fatalities (with all vehicles eCall-equipped, between 1% and 10% depending on country population density and road and emergency response infrastructure); reduction in the seriousness of the injuries (between 2% and 15%); reduction in congestion costs caused by traffic accidents; LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal addresses the part concerning the Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) infrastructure in the Commission strategy on eCall, based on a three-pronged regulatory approach encompassing the in-vehicle system, the telecommunications networks and the PSAPs. The current proposal calls on Member States to deploy the necessary eCall PSAP infrastructure required for the proper receipt and handling of all eCalls on their territory no later than 1 October 2015, in accordance with the specifications laid down by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall, in order to ensure the compatibility, interoperability and continuity of the EU-wide eCall service. Each Member State will be able to organise its emergency services in the way most cost effective and appropriate to its needs, including the possibility to filter calls that are not emergency calls and may not be handled by eCall PSAPs, in particular in the case of manually triggered eCalls.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: high-speed broadband infrastructure is the backbone of the Digital Single Market and a precondition for worldwide competitiveness, for example, in the field of e-Commerce. According to the 2010 report on the Single Market, telecommunications services and infrastructures in the EU are still highly fragmented along national borders. A recent report on the cost of non-Europe in the electronic communications sector has shown that the untapped potential of the Single Market corresponds to a yearly amount of 0.9% GDP, or EUR 110 billion. As recalled in the Communication on the Single Market Act II, a 10% increase in broadband penetration can result in a 1-1.5 % increase in the GDP annually and 1.5% labour productivity gains. Broadband-induced innovation in companies creates employment and has the potential to generate 2 million extra jobs by 2020. The Union has subscribed to ambitious broadband targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe: by 2013, basic broadband for all Europeans, and by 2020, (i) access to speeds of above 30 Mbps for all Europeans, and (ii) subscription of internet connection above 100 Mbps for 50% or more of European households. These goals will only be achieved if the infrastructure deployment costs are lowered across the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed four options: ·  Option 1 (Status quo) : maintaining the current approach of monitoring, enforcement and guidance. ·  Option 2 : recommending measures towards a more coherent and harmonised application by National Regulatory Authorities of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. ·  Option 3 : a proposal for a Regulation aiming at unlocking the potential of cross-sector cooperation (two sub-options, 3a and 3b, discuss options regarding respectively, a regulation only and a combination of a regulation and a recommendation). ·  Option 4 : a proposal for legislation complementing the current regulatory framework to mandate measures going beyond option 3, (such as infrastructure atlases, cost-oriented infrastructure access, mandated cooperation in civil engineering works even when not financed by public means, and installation of high-speed-ready infrastructure even in old buildings). The impact assessment concludes that option 3a is the best option available, given its effectiveness in achieving the objectives identified, the costs-benefits analysis, and ability to exploit the cost reduction potential efficiently and coherently with general EU policy objectives. A study estimates that if measures were taken to address the problems identified, the potential capital savings to operators are in the range of 20–30% of total investment costs, i.e. up to EUR 63 billion by 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the objectives of the proposed Regulation are to reduce the cost and enhance the efficiency of deploying high-speed electronic communications infrastructure by scaling up existing best practices across the EU. In order to do this, the proposal sets out a number of directly applicable rights and obligations across the various steps of infrastructure deployment, which can lead to significant cost reductions. The proposal aims to lower the barriers to investment and market entry (i) by allowing for more intensive usage of existing physical infrastructures, (ii) by enhancing cooperation on planned civil works, (iii) by streamlining procedures on granting permits and (iv) by removing obstacles to high-speed-ready in-building infrastructure. This initiative therefore addresses four main problem areas: ·  inefficiencies or bottlenecks concerning the use of existing physical infrastructure (such as ducts, conduits, manholes, cabinets, poles, masts, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions); ·  bottlenecks related to co-deployment; ·  inefficiencies regarding the granting of administrative permits; ·  bottlenecks concerning in-building deployment. In order to maximise synergies across networks, the regulation is aimed not only at electronic communications network providers but to any owner of physical infrastructures, such as electricity, gas, water and sewage, heating and transport services, which are suitable for hosting electronic communications network elements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 establishes the Union fleet capacity policy for vessels used to carry goods on inland waterways in the Member States. In line with their fleet capacity policies, Member States with inland waterways linked to those of another Member State and total fleet tonnage of over 100 000 tonnes set up an Inland Waterway Fund (the ‘Reserve Fund’) on the basis of the aforementioned Regulation. The funds are administered by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned under their national legislation and with their own administrative resources. National organisations representing inland waterway carriers are involved in this administration. The reserve funds may be used in only two situations: In the event of a ‘serious market disturbance’ in the inland waterway transport market, as referred to in Directive 96/75/EC, the Commission may, at the request of a Member State, take suitable measures, in particular measures designed to prevent any new increase in the transport capacity on offer on the market in question. If unanimously requested by the organisations representing inland waterway transport. In such as case, any Member State may take the measures as referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. The reserve funds, consisting solely of financial contributions from the industry, have never been used. The EU-level representative organisations approached the Commission once, in 2003, to enquire about possibilities for using the funds. However, the envisaged measures were considered to be outside the scope of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. The measures referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 only cover social aspects. However, these measures could be extended in particular to broaden the scope of training schemes, to strengthen the organisation of the sector and to create a context favourable to innovation and improved environmental performance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The Commission consulted the representative organisations on 11 April 2013 on the reasons for the reserve funds never having been used, even though the sector was experiencing a decline, and on possible solutions. They confirmed that the limited scope of Article 8 was a barrier to triggering the use of the funds and stated that they would be in favour of expanding the scope of the Article. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 by measures aiming to: make it easier for inland waterway carriers leaving the industry to obtain an early retirement pension or to transfer to another economic activity; organise vocational training or retraining schemes for crew members leaving the industry; improve skills in inland navigation in order to safeguard the development and future of the profession; encourage owner-operators to join trade associations and strengthen the organisations representing inland waterway transport at Union level; encourage adaptation of vessels to technical progress in order to improve working conditions and promote safety; encourage innovation of vessels and their adaptation to technical progress as regards the environment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since it accounts for 18 % of world exports and 20 % of world imports, the EU can claim to be the world's number one importer and exporter of agricultural products, jockeying for position with the United States. Over the years, the European sector has focussed on quality and added value, offering processed products that are increasingly popular in Europe and worldwide. Nevertheless, on the internal market only a small minority of European consumers are aware of the efforts undertaken by European farmers to supply high-quality, healthy and safe products. Only 14 % of Europeans recognise the logos of products that benefit from a protected designation of origin (PDO) or a protected geographical indication (PGI), these being the main European quality schemes established by the Union. European agriculture is faced today with a much more competitive environment, largely resulting from the globalisation of markets. This trend should continue in the coming years with the prospect of the Doha round and various bilateral and regional agreements currently under negotiation being concluded. Though often feared, these agreements might also give rise to major opportunities for the sector. Council Regulation (EC) n° 3/2008 currently sets out the main principles of the information provision and promotion measures on the internal market and in third countries for agricultural products. Reform of this policy is needed, one which learns from the lessons of the promotional programmes implemented to date. The objective is to support agriculture, and especially the SMEs and producer organisations that form the backbone of this sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the ‘targeted’ scenario is the favoured option: this scenario ensures targeting of promotion measures on the internal and external markets through the development and implementation of a strategy. It also encourages collaboration between operators in the various Member States (by means of directly managed multi-country programmes). The strategy will also allow the range of products and themes eligible under the promotion scheme to be widened. Lastly, this scenario involves better use of indications of the origin of products and brand names (e.g. ""banner"" brands). CONTENT: in view of the experience gained and likely trends in the agricultural sector and on markets both inside and outside the Union, the Commission proposes to repeal Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 replace it with a new regulation. The proposal aims to enable information provision and promotion measures necessary for the agricultural sector to be able to rise to the many challenges it faces in a context of growing competition and opening-up of markets to be implemented on the internal market and in third countries. The main points of the proposed reform are as follows: ·  measures targeting the internal market, limited to providing information on the specific characteristics of agricultural production methods in the Union or on themes which are relevant to the Union, such as the European quality systems; ·  measures to enhance the authenticity of Union products so as to improve consumers' awareness as to the qualities of genuine products as compared to imitations and counterfeit products; ·  opening up the information and promotion scheme to certain food products based on agricultural products; ·  the eligibility of wine for the information provision and promotion measures to be limited solely to wine which is associated with another agricultural or food product. ·  strict guidelines as regards the possibilities of mentioning the origin of products or brand names as a means of illustrating the main generic message highlighting the intrinsic characteristics of European agricultural products; ·  specific arrangements to encourage a larger number of information provision and promotion measures for Union agricultural products in third countries, with the aim of reaching 75 % of estimated expenditure; ·  opening up the scheme to producer organisations; ·  establishment of a work programme which defines the strategic priorities for these measures in terms of populations, products, themes or markets to be targeted and the nature of the information and promotion messages to be imparted; ·  development of new technical and support services at European level with the aim of helping operators take part in co-financed programmes, conduct effective campaigns or develop their export activities. ·  better management of programmes submitted by operators in different Member States; ·  a systematic impact assessment in order to confirm that the goals set have indeed been achieved; ·  simplification of administrative procedures: the Commission will be more active in managing multi-country programmes, thereby making it easier for them to be set up and implemented. The respective roles of Member State and the Commission in terms of monitoring and control must be clarified in order to avoid duplication and lengthy procedures. It is proposed that selection should take place solely at Commission level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: compared to the present situation, the proposal gradually but significantly increases the budget allocated to information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (from EUR 61.5 million in the 2013 budget to EUR 200 million in 2020). Total expenditure is estimated at EUR 883 million for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established in 2003 in response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases - HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis - and to the EU’s commitment to achieving the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The first EDCTP programme (EDCTP-I 2003-2012) is now beyond its active funding period. EDCTP-I had major achievements and has so far developed eight improved medical treatments, in particular for new-borns, children or pregnant/lactating women suffering from HIV/AIDS or malaria. It has resulted in the launch of the first four African Regional Networks of Excellence promoting South-South cooperation on clinical research and more than 400 African researchers have been trained. It has also contributed to establishing the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry and the African Vaccine Regulators Forum. Despite the results and impact of EDCTP so far, the health and socio-economic burden of poverty-related diseases persists and hinders the sustainable development of developing countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa. More than one billion people, including 400 million children, are suffering from one or more poverty-related diseases, including neglected infectious diseases such as sleeping sickness and worm infections. HIV/AIDS alone kills an estimated 2 million people, while malaria and tuberculosis together kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually. Following the recommendations from the independent interim evaluation of EDCTP-I, the Belgian EU Council Presidency proposed, in November 2010, the launch of a second EDCTP joint programme (EDCTP-2) with at least ten years duration (2014-2024). On 15 June 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in which it ‘asks the Commission, the Member States and developing countries to address MDG 5 (on improving maternal health), MDG 4 (on child mortality) and MDG 6 (on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) in a coherent and holistic way’. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the external interim evaluations of the EDCTP-I and the impact assessment of the future EDCTP-2 programme call for the programme to be continued but with the next programme lasting 10 years and covering a scope that extends to other poverty-related diseases (beyond HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria) and to all phases of clinical development. The geographical focus should continue to be on sub-Saharan Africa. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 185 and Article 188(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a decision concerns the participation of the Union in a second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme (EDCTP-2) jointly undertaken by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as Switzerland and Norway. EDCTP2 shall contribute to the reduction of the social and economic burden of poverty-related diseases in developing countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, by accelerating the clinical development of effective, safe and affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases, in partnership with sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP-2 seeks to achieve the following specific objectives: an increased number of new or improved medical interventions for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other poverty-related diseases, and by the end of the programme to have delivered (i) at least one new medical intervention; (ii) to have issued at least 30 guidelines for improved or extended use of existing medical interventions; and (iii) to have progressed the clinical development of at least 20 candidate medical interventions; strengthened cooperation with sub-Saharan African countries, in particular on building their capacity for conducting clinical trials; better coordination, alignment and integration of relevant national programmes to increase the cost-effectiveness of European public investments; extended international cooperation with other public and private funders; an increased impact due to effective cooperation with relevant European Union initiatives, including its development assistance. EDCTP-2 has been conceived to complement the actions implemented under the European Development Funds and the Development Cooperation Instruments, and to respond to the Union’s commitment to the 2012 Rio+20 conference conclusions on developing and achieving internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Union contribution shall be up to EUR 683 million at current prices including EFTA contribution. The envelope is in current prices. The Union contribution shall be made from the ‘Health, demographic change and wellbeing’ challenge, DG Research & Innovation envelope, as part of the implementation of Horizon 2020 – The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The maximum amount of Union contribution for administrative costs is up to EUR 41 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Council Directives 78/660/EE and 83/349/EEC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the approach currently taken in the Accounting Directives on the publication of non-financial information has not produced the desired results. It is estimated that only a limited number of large companies (2500 out of the total of 42000 in the EU) regularly publish non-financial information. The quality of the information disclosed varies, making it difficult for investors and stakeholders to understand and compare companies’ position and performance. Furthermore, national requirements are significantly diverse, which adds to the lack of clarity for companies and investors who operate across the Internal Market. In addition, insufficient diversity in boards may lead to a similarity of views of the members of the board of directors and more resistance to innovative ideas. The need to improve the transparency of the social and environmental information provided by companies in all sectors, in order to ensure a level playing field, has been acknowledged by the Commission in the Single Market Act and was reiterated in the Communication ""A renewed strategy 2011 – 2014 for Corporate Social Responsibility"". The European Parliament, in its two resolutions on “Corporate Social Responsibility: accountable, transparent and responsible business behaviour and sustainable growth” and “Corporate Social Responsibility: promoting society’s interests and a route to sustainable and inclusive recovery”, acknowledged the need to increase transparency in this field and called the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identified two main issues : 1) The inadequate transparency of non-financial information : the analysis has identified both a market and a regulatory failure as underlying causes of the problem. Following the assessment of policy options, the preferred option would be strengthening the existing obligation, by requiring a nonfinancial statement within the Annual Report. 2) The lack of diversity in boards of directors : the most appropriate option, at this stage, would be the disclosure of diversity policy. It is also the option that is preferred by most stakeholders compared to other options such as a compulsory diversity policy or to an action focusing only on recruitment policy. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal sets a requirement for certain large companies to disclose relevant non-financial and diversity information, ensuring a level playing field across the EU. It pursues the following key objectives: to increase the transparency of certain companies, and to increase the relevance, consistency, and comparability of the non-financial information currently disclosed, by strengthening and clarifying the existing requirements ; to increase diversity in the boardrooms of companies through enhanced transparency in order to facilitate an effective oversight of the management and robust governance of the company; to increase the company's accountability and performance, and the efficiency of the Single Market. The main points of the proposed directive are as follows: 1) Non-financial information : the proposal will require certain large companies to include a statement in their Annual Report including material information relating to at least environmental, social, and employee-related matters, respect of human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters. Within these areas, the statement will include (i) a description of its policies, (ii) results and (iii) risk-related aspects. The obligation will only apply to those companies where the average number of employees exceeds 500, and exceeds either a balance sheet total of EUR 20 million or a net turnover of EUR 40 million. This threshold, higher than the one currently applied within the Accounting Directives (250 employees) limits any undue administrative burden. It is estimated that, on this basis, the new requirement would cover around 18.000 companies in the EU. 2) Diversity : the amendment will require large listed companies to provide information on their diversity policy, including aspects concerning age, gender, geographical diversity, and educational and professional background. The information will be included in the corporate governance statement and will have to contain the objectives of such a policy, its implementation and the results obtained. Companies not having a diversity policy will only be obliged to explain why this is the case. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to afford European Union (EU) citizens a high level of human, animal and plant health, and guarantee the functioning of the internal market, Union legislation provides for a set of harmonised rules to prevent, eliminate or reduce the level of health risk to humans, animals and plants, which may arise along the 'agri-food chain’. To ensure that this extensive set of rules is enforced by the Member States (MS) across the EU in a harmonised manner, a legislative framework for the organisation of official controls has been established through Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. Based on an extensive review of the provisions of the Regulation, the Commission proposes revising the legislation on official controls to overcome shortcomings identified in its wording and in its application. The aim is to simplify and clarify the system and to establish a single framework applicable to all official controls along the entire food chain. The proposal replaces and repeals Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and a number of sectoral acts and provisions which will be made redundant by its adoption. It is part of a comprehensive package that also includes three major reviews to modernise the animal health, plant health and plant reproductive material acquis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the retained option was that which involves: (i) streamlining the legislative framework; (ii) integrating within the Regulation’s scope plant health, plant reproductive material (PRM) and animal by-products (ABP); and (iii) extending mandatory fees to cover all controls performed. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 43(2), 114 and 168(4)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to modernise and sharpen enforcement tools, and in particular official controls, as laid down in the existing Regulation, to simplify the legislative framework. It lays down harmonised rules at EU level aimed at providing a comprehensive and coherent approach to official controls along the entire agri-food chain. Scope: it is proposed to integrate the rules currently applicable to official controls in specific areas currently governed by separate sets of rules (e.g. controls on residues of veterinary medicinal products in live animals and animal products, and plant health controls) into the framework of a single Regulation. Lightening administrative burdens: the proposal makes changes in a number of situations where it is possible to alleviate the burden of organising and implementing official controls by eliminating redundant requirements (e.g. separate reporting from official controls on residues of veterinary medicinal products) or allowing a proportionate and flexible approach to some specific situations (e.g. not requiring full accreditation of official laboratories in case of emergencies). Sampling: requirements on methods of sampling and of laboratory analysis, testing and diagnosis will become applicable to official controls and to other official activities in all the sectors covered by the Regulation (e.g. to surveillance, monitoring and survey activities in the plant health and animal health sectors). A 5 years transitional period will thus be foreseen for the plant health and plant propagating material sectors. The rules for the choice of the method to be used by the official laboratory will be clarified and extended so as to require that methods meet state-of-the-art scientific standards. Official controls on animals and goods entering the Union: as far as imports are concerned, it is essential that all foodstuffs available on the EU market are safe. The proposal includes therefore a set of common and comprehensive rules applicable to controls performed on animals and goods from third countries. Border Control Posts (BCPs) will replace the different entities currently tasked with border control duties. A Common Health Entry Document (CHED) will be used (i) by operators for the mandatory prior notification of arrival of consignments of animals and goods and (ii) by competent authorities to record controls on such consignments and any decisions taken. Financing of official controls: Member States will be required to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to provide the staff and other resources necessary to the competent authorities to perform official controls and the other activities referred to in the Regulation. The proposal maintains the system of mandatory fees and extends it to most official controls. Micro-enterprises will be exempted from the payment of such fees. Administrative assistance and cooperation: the administrative assistance and cooperation provisions of the Regulation will be reinforced and clarified so as to increase their usability and effectiveness as a tool for tackling cross-border non-compliances. The proposal envisages the creation of an integrated information management system for official controls, which will allow the integrated operation and updating of all existing and future computerised systems through which information, data and documents regarding official controls are exchanged among competent authorities, and with the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not imply incurring any expenditure which is not already foreseen in the financial statement of the common financial framework. No additional human resources are envisaged either. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal includes provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (repealing Council Directive 87/357/EEC and Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the free movement of safe consumer products is one of the cornerstones of the European Union. Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety (GPSD) lays down the requirement that consumer products must be safe and that Member States' market surveillance authorities must take action against dangerous products as well as exchange information to that effect through the Community rapid information exchange system RAPEX. Overlaps of market surveillance rules and obligations of economic operators laid down in various pieces of Union legislation (the GPSD, the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that also covers consumer products) has led to confusion on the part of both economic operators and national authorities and has seriously hampered the effectiveness of market surveillance activity in the Union. The Commission considers that Directive 2001/95/EC needs to be fundamentally revised to improve its functioning and to ensure consistency with developments in Union legislation as regards market surveillance, obligations of economic operators and standardisation. In the interest of clarity, Directive 2001/95/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation. The proposal is part of the ""Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package"" which also includes a proposal for a single market surveillance regulation and a multiannual action plan for market surveillance covering the period 2013-2015. The Single Market Act II, adopted in 2012, confirms the ""Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package"" as a key action to improve the safety of products circulating in the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment prepared by the Commission thus covers aspects related to both this proposal and the proposal for a new Market Surveillance Regulation. The Commission's Impact Assessment Board delivered a favourable opinion in September 2012. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation on consumer product safety, which will replace Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety (GPSD), concerns manufactured non-food consumer products. It aims at clarifying the regulatory framework for consumer products taking into account legislative developments in recent years. Like the GPSD, the proposed Regulation requires that consumer products must be ""safe"", sets certain obligations on economic operators and contains provisions for the development of standards in support of the general safety requirement. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : the proposed Regulation clearly delimits its scope of application compared to sectoral Union harmonisation legislation. Whilst the general principle that all non-food consumer products must be safe applies across the board, the more detailed obligations on economic operators only apply to those operators that are not subject to corresponding obligations laid down in harmonising legislation covering a specific product sector. The definitions section has been updated and, where applicable aligned with the New Legislative Framework for the Marketing of Products. General safety requirement and obligations of economic operators : the general requirement, laid down already in the GPSD, that all consumer products must be safe when placed or made available on the Union market has been kept. However, its operation in practice will be significantly simplified due to the introduction of a clear link with sector-specific legislation and a simplification of the rules on standards. On the basis of Decision No 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products, the proposal: lays down the elementary obligations of economic operators (manufacturers, importers, distributors) involved in the supply chain of consumer products insofar as they are not subject to corresponding requirements under sector specific Union harmonisation legislation. These obligations concern issues related to labelling, product identification, corrective actions to be taken in case of unsafe products and information of the competent authorities; requires economic operators to be able to identify the operators who supplied them with the product and to whom they supplied it. Where justified due to the risks inherent to specific types of products, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures requiring economic operators to establish or adhere to an electronic traceability system. Use of European standards : like the GPSD, also the proposal for the new Regulation favours the use of standards in support of the implementation of the general safety requirement. However, the process to identify existing European standards or to ask for the development of European standards that would give rise to presume that a product is safe has been significantly simplified and aligned to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that sets a new overarching framework for European standardisation. Market surveillance and RAPEX : the provisions regarding market surveillance and RAPEX that are currently contained in the GPSD have been transferred to the proposal for a new single Market Surveillance Regulation. That new Regulation would produce a one-tier system in which all market surveillance rules are brought together in a single instrument and in which RAPEX will be the single alert system regarding products presenting a risk. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal does not have other budgetary implications than those related to the proper management of the Regulation which, in form of the GPSD, is already part of the Union law acquis. The budgetary implications are already foreseen in the existing or proposed programmes and respect the Commission proposal for the new multiannual financial framework. According to the financial statement, the total appropriations (operational appropriations, human resources and administrative expenditure) amount to EUR 12 019 million in commitments for 2015-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in a single market in which products circulate freely through 27 Member States, market surveillance needs to be highly coordinated and capable of reacting rapidly over a huge area. However, market surveillance has not kept pace with developments in the Union regulatory framework. Whilst advances have been made over the last decade, in particular with the implementation of Directive 2001/95/EC (General Product Safety Directive) and Regulation (EC) 765/2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance, the overlap of market surveillance rules and the obligations of economic operators laid down in various pieces of Union legislation has led to confusion on the part of both economic operators and national authorities and has seriously hampered the effectiveness of market surveillance activity in the Union. Different product evaluation requirements and procedures apply depending on the category of product involved. The proposal aims to simplify the rules. It should be noted that in response to calls from the European Parliament, the proposal was added to the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package, which also includes a proposal for a regulation on consumer product safety (replacing the GPSD) and a proposal on multi-annual action plan for market surveillance covering the period 2013-2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an impact assessment and a favourable opinion was delivered by the Impact Assessment Board in 2012. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 33, 114 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims at clarifying the regulatory framework for market surveillance in the field of non-food products. It merges the rules on market surveillance of the GPSD, Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and many sector-specific pieces of Union harmonisation legislation into a single legal instrument that applies horizontally across all sectors. The main aims are as follows: · to reduce the number of pieces of legislation containing market surveillance rules : the 3 tier system spread across the GPSD, Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and a range of sector-specific legislation will be reduced to a one tier system in which all those rules are brought together in a single instrument; · to eliminate overlaps in the current system: the new regulation will (a) dispense with the distinction between consumer and professional products for market surveillance purposes; (b) avoid making a distinction between harmonised products and non-harmonised products except where this is unavoidable in applying certain specific provisions. To the greatest extent possible the applicable rules will be the same for all products; · to dovetail the RAPEX and Union evaluation procedures : at present, there are two separate procedures operating, sometimes in parallel, which require Member States to notify to the Commission and to other Member States certain market surveillance action taken at national level. This is an especially problematic aspect of the overlapping categories of products mentioned above. Under the new Regulation the two procedures become a single procedural flow with certain events triggering a single notification to the other Member States and the Commission (made using either the proven RAPEX rapid alert system or the Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance in accordance with the distinction made in the Regulation). In urgent situations the Commission is empowered to adopt measures requiring consistent action across the EU against products presenting a serious risk; · to make the legislation more accessible: current market surveillance provisions are not based around a chronological flow of events. The new Regulation sets out the whole process of a market surveillance exercise in a chronological, sequential manner. It presents a chain of events, incorporating relevant provisions on publication of information, notification etc. at each stage of the procedure. This approach substantially improves the accessibility and user-friendliness of the legislation, and hence its effectiveness. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications are already envisaged in existing or proposed programmes and the initiative will be financed through redeployment of existing resources. According to the financial statement, the total appropriations (operational appropriations, human resources and administrative expenditure) amount to EUR 39 276 million in commitments for 2015-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) (Directive 2004/39/EC), in force since November 2007, is a core pillar in EU financial market integration. It establishes a regulatory framework for the provision of investment services in financial instruments (such as brokerage, advice, dealing, portfolio management, underwriting etc.) by banks and investment firms and for the operation of regulated markets by market operators. It also establishes the powers and duties of national competent authorities in relation to these activities. The result after 3.5 years in force is more competition between venues in the trading of financial instruments, and more choice for investors in terms of service providers and available financial instruments, progress which has been compounded by technological advances. Overall, transaction costs have decreased and integration has increased. However, some problems have surfaced: the benefits from this increased competition have not flowed equally to all market participants and have not always been passed on to the end investors, retail or wholesale; the market fragmentation implied by competition has also made the trading environment more complex; market and technological developments have outpaced various provisions in MiFID; the financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the regulation of instruments other than shares, traded mostly between professional investors. In line with the recommendations from the de Larosière group and the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of June 2009, the revision of MiFID therefore constitutes an integral part of the reforms aimed at establishing a safer, sounder, more transparent and more responsible financial system. It is also an essential vehicle for delivering on the G20  commitment to tackle less regulated and more opaque parts of the financial system, and improve the organisation, transparency and oversight of various market segments, especially in those instruments traded mostly over the counter (OTC), complementing the legislative proposal on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. The proposal amending MiFID is divided in two: this draft Regulation on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation [EMIR] on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories; the proposed Directive on markets in financial instruments, repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were assessed against different criteria: transparency of market operations for regulators and market participants, investor protection and confidence, level playing field for market venues and trading systems in the EU, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the review of MiFID is estimated to generate one-off compliance costs of between EUR 512 and EUR 732 million and ongoing costs of between EUR 312 and EUR 586 million. This represents one-off and ongoing cost impacts of respectively 0.10% to 0.15% and 0.06% to 0.12% of total operating spending of the EU banking sector. This is far less than the costs imposed at the time of the introduction of MiFID. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation sets out requirements in relation to the disclosure of trade transparency data to the public and transaction data to competent authorities, removing barriers to non-discriminatory access to clearing facilities, the mandatory trading of derivatives on organised venues, specific supervisory actions regarding financial instruments and positions in derivatives, and the provision of services by third-country firms without a branch. A central aim of the proposal is to ensure that all organised trading is conducted on regulated trading venues: regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and organised trading facilities (OTFs). Identical pre and post trade transparency requirements will apply to all of these venues. The transparency requirements will be calibrated for different types of instruments, notably equity, bonds, and derivatives, and for different types of trading, notably order book and quote driven systems. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Extension of transparency rules to equity like instruments and actionable indications of interests : MiFID has established transparency rules, both pre and post trade that apply to shares admitted to trading on regulated markets, including when those shares are traded on an MTF or over the counter (OTC). The proposed provisions first extend the transparency rules applicable by these shares to equity like instruments such as depository receipts, exchange-traded funds, certificates and other similar financial instruments issues by companies. The extension of the transparency requirements will also cover actionable indications of interests (IOIs). Increased consistency in the application of waivers to pre trade transparency for equities markets : the proposed provisions will oblige the competent authorities to inform ESMA about the use of the waivers in their markets and ESMA will issue an opinion on the compatibility of the waiver with the requirements established in this Regulation and prospective delegated acts. Extension of transparency rules to bonds, structured finance products and derivatives : the proposal extends the principles of transparency rules up to now only applicable to equity markets to bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives. Increased and more efficient data consolidation : the proposed provisions will contribute to reducing the cost of data by requesting trading venues, that is regulated markets, MTFs or OTFs to make post trade information available free of charge 15 minutes after the execution of the transaction, to offer pre- and post-trade data separately, and by giving the possibility to the Commission to clarify by delegated acts what constitutes a reasonable commercial basis. The proposal also requires investment firms to make public trades executed outside trading venues via Approved Publication Arrangements which will themselves be regulated in the Directive. This should significantly improve the quality of OTC data and consequently facilitate its consolidation. Transparency for investment firms trading OTC including systematic internalisers : the existing transparency rules for systematic internalisers will apply to shares and equity-like instruments, while new provisions would be introduced for bonds, structured finance products admitted to trading on a regulated market or for which a prospectus has been published, emission allowances and derivatives which are clearing-eligible or are admitted to trading on a regulated market or are traded on an MTF or an OTF. Transaction reporting : all transactions in financial instruments will need to be reported to competent authorities, except for transactions in financial instruments which are not traded in an organised way and are not susceptible to market abuse and cannot be used for abusive purposes. Competent authorities will have full access to records at all stages in the order execution process, from the initial decision to trade, through to its execution. Trading of derivatives : consistent with the requirements already proposed by the Commission (EMIR) to increase central clearing of OTC derivatives, the proposed provisions in this Regulation will require trading in suitably developed derivatives to occur only on eligible platforms, that is regulated markets, MTFs or OTFs. This obligation will be imposed on both financial and non financial counterparties exceeding the clearing threshold in EMIR. Non-discriminatory clearing access : the proposed provisions will prohibit discriminatory practices and prevent barriers that may prevent competition for the clearing of financial instruments. Supervision of products and positions : the proposed amendments will greatly increase the supervision of products and services by introducing the possibilities on the one hand, for competent authorities to set permanent bans on financial products or activities or practices with coordination by ESMA, and on the other hand, for ESMA to also temporarily ban products, practices and services. The proposed provisions in the Regulation introduce a role for ESMA to coordinate the measures taken at national level and specific powers to manage or limit positions for market participants. Provision of investment services by third country firms without a branch : the proposal creates a harmonised framework for granting access to EU markets for firms and market operators based in third countries in order to overcome the current fragmentation into national third country regimes and to ensure a level playing field for all financial services actors in the EU territory. The proposal introduces a regime based on a preliminary equivalence assessment of third country jurisdictions by the Commission. Third country firms from third countries for which an equivalence decision has been adopted would be able to request to provide services in the Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) (Directive 2004/39/EC), in force since November 2007, is a core pillar in EU financial market integration. It establishes a regulatory framework for the provision of investment services in financial instruments (such as brokerage, advice, dealing, portfolio management, underwriting etc.) by banks and investment firms and for the operation of regulated markets by market operators. It also establishes the powers and duties of national competent authorities in relation to these activities. The result after 3.5 years in force is more competition between venues in the trading of financial instruments, and more choice for investors in terms of service providers and available financial instruments, progress which has been compounded by technological advances. Overall, transaction costs have decreased and integration has increased. However, some problems have surfaced: the benefits from this increased competition have not flowed equally to all market participants and have not always been passed on to the end investors, retail or wholesale; the market fragmentation implied by competition has also made the trading environment more complex; market and technological developments have outpaced various provisions in MiFID; the financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the regulation of instruments other than shares, traded mostly between professional investors. In line with the recommendations from the de Larosière group and the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of June 2009, the revision of MiFID therefore constitutes an integral part of the reforms aimed at establishing a safer, sounder, more transparent and more responsible financial system. It is also an essential vehicle for delivering on the G20  commitment to tackle less regulated and more opaque parts of the financial system, and improve the organisation, transparency and oversight of various market segments, especially in those instruments traded mostly over the counter (OTC), complementing the legislative proposal on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. The review of MiFID will contribute to establishing a single rulebook for EU financial markets, help further develop a level playing field for Member States and market participants, improve supervision and enforcement, reduce costs for market participants, and improve conditions of access and enhance the global competitiveness of the EU financial industry. The proposal amending MiFID is divided in two: this proposed Directive on markets in financial instruments, repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council; the draft Regulation on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation [EMIR] on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were assessed against different criteria: transparency of market operations for regulators and market participants, investor protection and confidence, level playing field for market venues and trading systems in the EU, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the review of MiFID is estimated to generate one-off compliance costs of between EUR 512 and EUR 732 million and ongoing costs of between EUR 312 and EUR 586 million. This represents one-off and ongoing cost impacts of respectively 0.10% to 0.15% and 0.06% to 0.12% of total operating spending of the EU banking sector. This is far less than the costs imposed at the time of the introduction of MiFID. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive amends specific requirements regarding the provision of investment services, the scope of exemptions from the current Directive, organisational and conduct of business requirements for investment firms, organisational requirements for trading venues, the authorisation and ongoing obligations applicable to providers of data services, powers available to competent authorities, sanctions, and rules applicable to third-country firms operating via a branch. A central aim of the proposal is to ensure that all organised trading is conducted on regulated trading venues: regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and organised trading facilities (OTFs). Identical pre and post trade transparency requirements will apply to all of these venues. Likewise, the requirements in terms of organisational aspects and market surveillance applicable to all three venues are nearly identical. This will ensure a level playing field where there are functionally similar activities bringing together third-party trading interests. Importantly however, the transparency requirements will be calibrated for different types of instruments, notably equity, bonds, and derivatives, and for different types of trading, notably order book and quote driven systems. The main elements of the proposed Directive are as follows: Extension of MiFID rules to like products and services : the proposals extend MiFID requirements, and particularly conduct of business and conflicts of interest rules, to the advised and non-advised sale of structured deposits by credit institutions, specify that MiFID also applies to investment firms and credit institutions selling their own securities when not providing any advice, and require Member States to apply authorisation and conduct of business requirements analogous to MiFID in national legislation applicable to locally-based entities. Revision of exemptions from MiFID : the proposal therefore limits the exemptions more clearly to activities which are less central to MiFID and primarily proprietary or commercial in nature, or which do not constitute high-frequency trading. Upgrades to the market structure framework : the proposal creates a new category for organised trading facilities which do not correspond to any of the existing categories, underpinned by strong organisational requirements and identical transparency rules, and upgrade key requirements across all venues to account for the greater competition and cross-border trading generated together by technological advances and MiFID. Improvements to corporate governance : the proposals seek to ensure members of the management body possess the sufficient knowledge and skills and comprehend the risks associated with the activity of the firm in order to ensure the firm is managed in a sound and prudent way in the interests of investors and market integrity. Enhanced organisational requirements to safeguard the efficient functioning and integrity of markets : the proposals aim to bring all entities engaged in high-frequency trading into MiFID, require appropriate organisational safeguards from these firms and those offering market access to other high-frequency traders, and require venues to adopt appropriate risk controls to mitigate disorderly trading and ensure the resiliency of their platforms. Enhancement of the investor protection framework : the proposal strengthens the regulatory framework for the provision of investment advice and portfolio management and the possibility for investment firms to accept incentive by third parties (inducements) as well as it clarifies the conditions and arrangements under which investors are able to transact freely in the market in certain non-complex instruments with minimal duties or protections afforded on behalf of their investment firm. Furthermore, it reinforces the requirements concerning the handling of funds or instruments belonging to clients by investment firms and their agents and classifies as an investment service the safekeeping of financial instruments on behalf of clients. The proposal helps improving the information to clients in relation to the services provided to them and to the execution of their orders. Heightened protection in the provision of investment services to non-retail clients : the overarching high level principle to act honestly, fairly and professionally and the obligation to be fair, clear and not misleading should apply irrespective of client categorization. Finally, it is proposed that eligible counterparties benefit from better information and documentation for services provided. New requirements for trading venues : the proposal therefore introduces a requirement for trading venues to publish annual data on execution quality. Second, commodity derivative contracts traded on trading venues frequently attract the broadest participation by users and investors and can often serve as a benchmark price discovery venues feeding into, for example, retail energy and food prices. It is therefore proposed that all trading venues on which commodity derivative contracts are traded adopt appropriate limits or alternative arrangements to ensure the orderly functioning of the market. An improved regime for SME markets : it is proposed to create a new subcategory of markets known as SME growth markets. An operator of such a market (which are usually operated as MTFs) could elect to apply to have the MTF also registered as an SME growth market if it meets certain conditions. Third country regime : the proposal creates a harmonised framework for granting access to EU markets for firms and market operators based in third countries in order to overcome the current fragmentation into national third country regimes and to ensure a level playing field for all financial services actors in the EU territory. It introduces a regime based on a preliminary equivalence assessment of third country jurisdictions by the Commission. Third country firms from third countries for which an equivalence decision has been adopted would be able to request to provide services in the Union. Services provided to eligible counterparties would not require the establishment of a branch; third country firms could provide them subject to ESMA registration. They would be supervised in their country. Appropriate cooperation agreement between the supervisors in third countries and national competent authorities and ESMA would be necessary. Increased and more efficient data consolidation : the proposals improve the quality and consistency of data by requiring that all firms publish their trade reports through Approved Publication Arrangement (APA). The provisions set procedures for competent authority to authorise the APAs and set organisational requirements for the APAs. Heightened powers over derivative-positions for competent authorities : the regulators would be bestowed with explicit powers to demand information from any person regarding the positions held in the derivative instruments concerned as well as in emission allowances. The supervisory authorities would be able to intervene at any stage during the life of a derivative contract and take action that a position be reduced. This heightened position management would be complemented by the possibility to limit positions in an ex-ante, non-discriminatory fashion. All actions should be notified to ESMA. Effective sanctions : Member States should provide that appropriate administrative sanctions and measures can be applied to breaches of MiFID. To this end, the Directive will require them to comply with the following minimum rules. The maximum level of administrative pecuniary sanctions laid down in national legislation should exceed the benefits derived from the breach if they can be determined and, in any case, should not be lower than the level provided for by the Directive. Criminal sanctions are not covered by this proposal. Emission allowances : unlike trading in derivatives, spot secondary markets in EU emission allowances (EUAs) are largely unregulated. A range of fraudulent practices have occurred in spot markets which could undermine trust in the emissions trading scheme (ETS), set up by the EU ETS Directive. In parallel to measures within the EU ETS Directive to reinforce the system of EUA registries and conditions for opening an account to trade EUAs, the proposal would render the entire EUA market subject to financial market regulation. Both spot and derivative markets would be under a single supervisor. MiFID and the Directive 2003/6/EC on market abuse would apply, thereby comprehensively upgrading the security of the market without interfering with its purpose, which remains emissions reduction. Moreover, this will ensure coherence with the rules already applying to EUA derivatives and lead to greater security as banks and investment firms, entities obliged to monitor trading activity for fraud, abuse or money laundering, would assume a bigger role in vetting prospective spot traders. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to task allocated to ESMA. Total appropriations are estimated at EUR 1 744 million from 2013 to 2015.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: powers which may be delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a particular legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the implementing powers which shall be conferred on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed, as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers, the Commission has committed itself to reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU, legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (previously known as “comitology”). The overall objective is to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments by the end of Parliament’s seventh term (June 2014). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 in order to align it with the new institutional context. It is proposed to: empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in order to provide a satisfactory response to users' needs for statistical information without imposing excessive burdens on economic operators, to take into account changes necessary for methodological reasons and the necessity to set up an efficient system for the collection of data and the compilation of statistics; confer implementing powers on the Commission enabling it to adopt measures in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, the arrangements for collecting Intrastat information, particularly concerning the codes to be used, technical provisions for compiling annual statistics on trade by business characteristics and any measures necessary to ensure the quality of the statistics transmitted according to the quality criteria. The Commission is also proposing to: clarify the definition of “statistical value” and align the current definition of this data element in intra-EU trade statistics with that of the extra-EU trade statistics; restructure the European Statistical System (ESS) to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure, with the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. In February 2012, the ESSC supported this new approach. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union’s General Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the international maritime safety conventions require flag States to ensure that the equipment carried on board ships complies with certain safety requirements as regards design, construction and performance, and to issue the relevant certificates. To that end, detailed performance and testing standards for certain types of marine equipment have been developed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and by the international and European standardisation bodies. The international instruments leave a significant margin of discretion to the flag administrations . Back in 1995, the Commission clearly identified the problems encountered in the Internal Market as a result of this state of affairs and in the absence of EU harmonisation in the marine equipment sector. Council Directive 96/98/EC on marine equipment (MED) thus laid down common rules to eliminate differences in the implementation of international standards by means of a clearly identified set of requirements and uniform certification procedures. Experience has shown that it is necessary to take additional measures in order to enhance the implementation and enforcement mechanisms of the said Directive and simplify the regulatory environment while guaranteeing that IMO requirements are applied and implemented in a harmonised way across the Union. Decision No 768/2008 (New Legislative Framework) constitutes a general framework of a horizontal nature for future legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products and a reference text for existing legislation. This general framework provides appropriate solutions to the problems identified in the implementation of Directive 96/98/EC. It is therefore necessary to incorporate the definitions and reference provisions of Decision No 768/2008 into this Directive by making the adaptations which are required by the specific features of the marine equipment sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on two alternatives to the baseline (statu quo) scenario, namely: (i) a maximum alignment with the new legislative framework; and (ii) conditional alignment, allowing for a number of MED-specific measures in order to cater for the sector's particular features. The analysis showed that conditional alignment was the most effective and least burdensome solution and, at the same time, it had the most positive overall economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish requirements for marine equipment to meet the safety standards laid down in the applicable international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, in order to ensure that equipment which complies with these requirements can circulate unimpeded within the Internal Market and be placed on board ships flying the flag of any Member State . Scope : the scope of the Directive is defined by reference to equipment which is (a) due to be installed on board a ship flying the flag of a Member State , and (b) for which the approval of the flag State is required by the international conventions. Requirements for marine equipment : these are defined by reference to the international conventions and instruments. As required by these, demonstration of compliance is confined to the specific applicable testing standards. Given the need to ensure continued consistency with the international regulatory framework, these requirements and standards must apply in their up-to-date version. Responsibility : the proposal provides that the flag State has the responsibility to ensure that only equipment which has been duly approved in accordance with the then applicable requirements of the international instruments is placed on board ships flying its flag. In addition, the proposed Directive: provides the basis for the free movement of marine equipment within the EU, based on the concept of mutual recognition between Member States of equipment complying with the requirements laid down in the Directive; reflects the priority given to the international regulation of maritime safety, consistent with the global nature of shipping; governs the particular case of the transfer of a ship to a Member State's register based on the principle of compliance with the Directive’s requirements; established rules and conditions for affixing the wheel mark; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards the specific obligations of the economic operators; lists the conformity-checking procedures made available to manufacturers; aligns the Directive with Decision 768/2008 as regards the EU declaration of conformity; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards notification, notifying authorities, notified bodies and their respective regimes; fully aligns the Directive with the general EU market surveillance framework, including as regards the safeguard procedure. Checks on board may be necessary and are therefore regulated; contains the specific regime in exceptional circumstances, largely taken from the existing Directive. This regime concerns exemptions in cases of technical innovation or for the purpose of testing and evaluation. Lastly, as regards the implementation measures, the Commission: shall be empowered to uniformly implement the requirement for marine equipment to comply with the specific design, construction and performance requirements laid down in the international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, as defined by the Legislator; is also empowered to adopt common criteria and procedures for the application of these requirements and standards; is charged with the task of gathering and publishing a significant package of information. This codifies and expands existing practice and will facilitate the implementation of the Directive by all actors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The tasks devolved to the Commission, including those for which the assistance of the European Maritime Safety Agency is foreseen, are not expected to represent an increase in workload and will be carried out with existing resources. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 97/23/EC is an example of that Union harmonisation legislation, ensuring the free movement of pressure equipment. It sets out essential safety requirements that pressure equipment and assemblies must comply with in order to be made available on the EU market. (1) Experience with the enforcement of the legislation has shown that measures taken at national level have led to divergent approaches and to a different treatment of economic operators inside the EU, which undermines the objective of this directive. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the ‘New Legislative Framework’ was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). In view of ensuring consistency across Union harmonisation legislation for industrial products, it is necessary to align Directive 97/23/EC to the provisions of the NLF Decision. The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF implementation package adopted on 21 November 2011. (2) Directive 97/23/EC provides for a classification of pressure equipment in categories, according to the ascending level of risk due to pressure. This includes the classification of the fluid contained in the pressure equipment as dangerous or not, according to Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. On 1 June 2015 Directive, 67/548/EEC is to be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, which implements in the Union the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals that has been adopted at international level, within the United Nations (UN) structure. Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 introduces new hazard classes and categories only partially corresponding to those provided for by Directive 67/548/EEC. Directive 97/23/EC should therefore be aligned to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 while maintaining the existing levels of protection of that Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Alignment to the New Legislative Framework Decision : three options were examined and compared: Option 1 - no changes to the current situation; Option 2 - alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 - alignment to the NLF Decision by legislative measures. This option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into Directive 97/23/EC. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option. Alignment to the CLP Regulation : the impact assessment study concluded that the impact of the proposed alignment would be limited and in particular that the overall economic impact will be low. Based on the number of substances that would be subject to a different classification and the proportion of manufacturers that would be affected, the impact assessment study estimates the overall costs of aligning Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation to be of the order of EUR 8.5 million per year. The cost is due to the changes in the alignment for the health hazard classes. However, looking at the current compliance costs, and according to the impact assessment study, the total average cost of the conformity assessment for the pressure equipment covered by Directive 97/23/EC is estimated at EUR 236.3 million per year. Therefore, the incremental cost due to the alignment of Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation is low compared to the total cost for conformity assessment. However, the implementation of the CLP Regulation in the Union is mandatory and the cost cannot be avoided. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal intends to align Directive 97/23/EC on pressure equipment to: the ‘goods package’ adopted in 2008 and in particular to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products; Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures. The changes made to the provisions of Directive 97/23/EC concern: the definitions, the obligations of economic operators, the presumption of conformity provided by harmonised standards, the declaration of conformity, CE marking, conformity assessment bodies, the safeguard clause procedure, the conformity assessment procedures and the classification of the fluids. The proposal includes: measures to address the problem of non-compliance by clarifying the obligations of economic operators and requiring enhanced traceability requirements; measures intended to ensure the quality of work done by conformity assessment bodies by reinforcing the notification requirements, revised notification process, specifying requirements for notifying authorities and more stringent information obligations; measures intended to ensure greater consistency amongst Directives by aligning commonly used definitions and terminology and aligning the conformity assessment procedures. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I Regulation (recast)), recasting Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, was adopted. Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 will enter into application on 10 January 2015. In December 2012, an agreement was reached on the so-called “patent package”: two Regulations on the unified patent ( Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012). These were adopted in enhanced cooperation involving 25 Member States (all Member States except Italy and Spain); and an international Agreement (the ""Unified Patent Court Agreement"" or ""UPC Agreement"") , laying the ground for the creation of unitary patent protection in the European Union. This was signed on 19 Februrary 2013 by the majority of Member States. Article 89(1) of the UPC Agreement provides that the Agreement cannot enter into force prior to the entry into force of the amendments to the Brussels I Regulation (recast) regulating the relationship between both instruments. On 15 October 2012, the three Member States (Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) who are Contracting Parties to the Treaty of 31 March 1965 concerning the establishment and statute of a Benelux Court of Justice signed a Protocol modifying the said Treaty creating the possibility to extend the competences of the Benelux Court of Justice to include jurisdictional competences in specific matters which come within the scope of the Brussels I Regulation. As a result, similar to the UPC Agreement, the Protocol to the Benelux Treaty requires an amendment to the Brussels I Regulation (recast) with the aim (i) to ensure compliance between the revised Treaty and the Brussels I Regulation (recast), and (ii) to address the lack of common jurisdiction rules vis-à-vis defendants in non-European Union States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the matter of jurisdictional rules vis-à-vis State defendants was extensively assessed in the Commission's impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposal amending Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (""Brussels I""). The conclusions of that assessment are a fortiori relevant for the limited harmonisation foreseen in this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 67(4) and points (a), (c) and (e) of Article 81(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal aims, firstly, at allowing the entry into force of the UPC Agreement. Article 89(1) of the UPC Agreement makes the entry into force of the Agreement dependent on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2012. In addition, the proposal aims at ensuring compliance with the Brussels I Regulation of this Agreement as well as the Protocol to the Benelux Treaty of 1965. In order to ensure the combined and coherent application of the Agreement and Protocol and the Brussels I Regulation (recast), it is necessary to address the following issues in the Brussels I Regulation (recast): clarify in the text of the Regulation that the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice are ‘courts’ within the meaning of the Brussels I Regulation; clarify the operation of the rules on jurisdiction with respect to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice insofar as defendants domiciled in Member States are concerned; create uniform rules for the international jurisdiction vis-à-vis third State defendants in proceedings against such defendants brought in the Unified Patent Court and Benelux Court of Justice in situations where the Brussels I Regulation does not itself provide for such rules but refers to national law; define the application of the rules on lis pendens and related actions in relation to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice, on the one hand, and the national courts of Member States which are not Contracting Party to the respective international agreements on the other; clarify the operation of the rules on recognition and enforcement in the relations between Member States which are and Member States which are not Contracting Parties to the respective international agreements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the entry into force of the TFEU, the powers delegated to the Commission must be aligned with Article 290 (delegated acts), and Article 291 (implementing acts). The Commission has made a commitment to review legislative acts which currently contain references to regulatory procedure with scrutiny in the light of the criteria laid down in the Treaty. The overall objective is to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments by the end of Parliament’s seventh term (June 2014). Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community contains references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny and should therefore be reviewed in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU. The EU Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the biggest household survey in Europe. The results produced form the backbone of the statistical information system on labour markets in the European Union. In particular, the LFS provides the indicators for three of the Europe 2020 headline targets. Each year, the core LFS is supplemented with an ad hoc module, which serves predominantly European policy initiatives, such as the European Employment Strategy, the Youth on the Move flagship initiative, the Strategy for Equality between Women and Men, the European agenda for integration and the Employment Package. The sustainable production of high-quality ad hoc module data is of utmost importance to EU decision-makers, and thus it is proposed that a provision on financing be integrated into the Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the main objectives of the proposal are as follows: 1) Amend Regulation (EC) No 577/98 in order to align it to the new institutional context. The Commission may adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU: (i) the content of the ad hoc modules, the definitions and any adjustment of the list of survey variables made necessary by the evolution of techniques and concepts; (ii) the list of structural variables, including the minimum sample size and the survey frequency. Implementing powers are conferred upon the Commission with a view to ensuring uniform conditions concerning the transmission of statistical information, in particular by adopting the rules on the edits to be used, the codification of the variables and the list of principles for the formulation of questions concerning labour status. 2) Allow the Commission to provide for a financial contribution. The contribution by the Union to the financing of the implementation of modules is proposed through grant procedures, without calls for proposals. The grants are to be awarded to the national statistical institutes and other national authorities referred to in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total amount in commitment and payment appropriations (operational appropriations and human resources) is estimated at EUR 15.890 million for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein has been initiated by the Commission. The new Regulation was to have superseded the various acts incorporated in it. In the meantime the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. · Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts). · Article 291 of the TFEU allows the legislator to confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed (implementing acts). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE). CONTENT: Regulation (EC) No 338/97 contains provisions for which such a delegation of power or such a conferral of implementing powers would be opportune. It is therefore proposed to transform the codification of Regulation (EC) No 338/97 into a recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendments. The Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU in respect of the adoption of certain measures regulating trade in species of wild fauna and flora, of certain amendments to the Annexes to the Regulation and of additional measures to implement resolutions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (CITES), decisions or recommendations of the Standing Committee of the Convention and recommendations of the Convention Secretariat. When preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, the Commission should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. Lastly, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it can be estimated that around one million workers are posted each year by their employers from one Member State to another. Posting thus concerns 0.4% of the active population of EU-15 sending countries and 0.7% of the active population of EU-12 sending countries. In terms of labour mobility within the EU, the number of postings represented 18.5% of non-national EU-27 citizens in the labour force in 2007. The economic importance of posting exceeds by far its quantitative size, as it can play a crucial economic role in filling temporary shortfalls in the labour supply in certain professions or sectors (e.g. construction and transport). Furthermore, the posting of workers enhances international trade in services with all advantages linked to the Single Market such as higher competition, and efficiency gains. Posted workers are covered by Directive 96/71/EC (the Posting of Workers Directive). The Directive aims to reconcile the freedom to provide cross-border services under Article 56 TFEU with appropriate protection of the rights of workers temporarily posted abroad for that purpose. It sets out mandatory rules at EU level that must be applied to posted workers in the host country, and establishes a core set of clearly defined terms and conditions of work and employment that must be complied with by the service provider in the host country to ensure the minimum protection of workers. The Directive thus provides a significant level of protection for workers and also plays a key role in promoting a climate of fair competition between all service providers by guaranteeing both a level playing field and legal certainty for service providers, service recipients, and workers posted for the provision of services. However, the Commission’s evaluation of the Directive in 2003 identified several deficiencies and problems of incorrect implementation. Guidelines adopted in 2006 aimed at clarifying the extent to which certain national control measures could be justified in view of the Court of Justice’s jurisprudence. In its Communication of 2007 the Commission highlighted several shortcomings as regards the way controls were carried out in some Member States and the poor quality of administrative cooperation and access to information. The judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking-Line, Laval, Rüffert and Commission v Luxembourg cases triggered an intense debate among EU institutions, academics and social partners. This focused on two major issues: · how to set the right balance between the exercise by trade unions of their right to take collective action, including the right to strike, and the economic freedoms enshrined in the TFEU, in particular the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services; · how to interpret some key provisions in Directive 96/71/EC, such as the concept of public policy, the material scope of the terms and conditions of employment imposed by the Directive and the nature of mandatory rules, in particular the minimum wage. In October 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution, calling on all Member States properly to enforce the Posting of Workers Directive and emphasised that the freedom to provide services as one of the cornerstones of the European project should be balanced, on the one hand, against fundamental rights and the social objectives of the Treaties and on the other hand, against the right of the public and social partners to ensure non-discrimination, equal treatment and the improvement of living and working conditions. By facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition, this initiative will allow the potential for growth offered by the posting of workers and jobs for posted workers to be tapped as a key element in the provision of services in the internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives based on an external study. All options were analysed against the following specific objectives: · better protection of the rights of posted workers; · facilitating the cross-border provision of services and improving the climate of fair competition; · improving legal certainty as regards the balance between social rights and economic freedoms, in particular in the context of the posting of workers. The preferred option is a combination of different measures. A package of regulatory measures to deal with the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of the minimum working conditions and with the abuse of posted worker status in order to evade or circumvent legislation, combined with non- regulatory measures to deal with controversial or unclear interpretation of the terms and conditions of employment required by Directive 96/71/EC, is considered to be overall the most effective and efficient solution to address the specific objectives. Furthermore, a positive impact on SMEs and especially micro-businesses can be expected thanks to the improved and clearer regulatory environment. Micro-businesses will not be excluded from the of the proposal scope because this would undermine one of the proposal's key objectives - the fight against letter box companies - and it would create considerable new loopholes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: without re-opening Directive 96/71/EC, this proposal aims to improve, enhance and reinforce the way in which the latter Directive is applied and enforced in practice across the EU. It aims to establish a general common framework of appropriate provisions and measures for better and more uniform implementation, application and enforcement of the Directive, including measures to prevent any circumvention or abuse of the rules. It ensures at the same time guarantees for the protection of posted workers’ rights and the removal of unjustified obstacles to the free provision of services. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a Regulation clarifying the exercise of the right to take collective action within the context of the economic freedoms of the Single Market. Preventing abuse and circumvention - elements improving implementation and better monitoring of application of the notion of posting: the proposal: · clarifies the definition of ‘posted worker’ laid down in Directive 96/71/EC42, since it has often been difficult to determine whether there is a posting within the meaning of the Directive. Abuses have also been committed by employers exploring insufficient clarity of the legal provisions in order to circumvent the applicable rules; · the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place is further clarified in the context of administrative cooperation. Access to information: access to advance information about the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country is a prerequisite for interested parties to be able to provide services in compliance with Directive 96/71/EC. The proposal contains a number of more detailed measures to help ensure easily accessible and generally available information on the terms and conditions to be respected, including where these are laid down in collective agreements. Administrative cooperation and mutual assistance : the proposal lays down: · the general principles, rules and procedures necessary for effective administrative cooperation and assistance; · the role of the Member State from which the posting takes place; · an appropriate legal basis for the use of the separate and specific application of the Internal Market Information System (‘IMI’) as the electronic information exchange system to facilitate administrative cooperation on the posting of workers; · accompanying measures to develop, facilitate, support, promote and further improve administrative cooperation and to increase mutual trust, including through financial support. Monitoring compliance : these provisions cover national control measures, including those which may be applied to legally resident and lawfully employed third-country nationals who are posted within the EU by their employer, as well as inspections. A review clause has been included in order to evaluate the situation further, in particular to examine the necessity and appropriateness of the application of national control measures in the light of the experiences with the functioning of the system of administrative cooperation as well as technological developments. In its case law, the ECJ has further clarified the compatibility of certain national control measures with EU law. The Commission discusses the relevant case law and states that it is considered appropriate to clarify this case law by codifying it in the proposal, indicating clearly which requirements are compatible with obligations under EU law and which are not. By complying with their obligations, Member States would substantially contribute to reducing administrative burdens and SMEs would benefit from better enforcement of the existing Directive, a more level playing field and fairer competition. Improved administrative cooperation and effective and adequate inspections based on risk assessment would make inspections more effective and reduce costs for companies in non-risk sectors or situations and thus contribute to less burdensome controls. Furthermore, effective and adequate inspections, primarily based on regular risk assessment by the competent authorities, should be carried out in order to control and monitor compliance with the applicable rules. In order to reflect the different industrial relations systems and diversity of systems of control in the Member States, other actors and/or bodies may also monitor certain terms and conditions of employment of posted workers, such as the minimum rates of pay and working time. Enforcement: the proposal sets out provisions on the enforcement and defence of rights, which in itself concerns a fundamental right: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union confirms the right to effective remedy for everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the EU are not respected. Complaint mechanisms : the proposal sets out provisions on effective mechanisms for posted workers to lodge complaints directly or through designated third parties, such as trade unions, subject to their approval. Joint and several liabilities : the protection of workers rights is a matter of particular concern in subcontracting chains, which are particularly widespread in the construction sector in the EU. There is evidence that, in a number of cases, posted workers are exploited and left without payment of wages or part of the wages they are entitled to under the Directive 96/71/EC. The European Parliament has adopted several resolutions on this issue, calling upon the Commission to establish a legislative instrument on joint and several liability at EU level, in particular for long subcontracting chains (see However, a cautious approach is required in this respect in order to take due account of the variety of legal systems in place in the Member States, as well as the impact such a system may have on cross-border service provision within the Internal Market. The proposal contains specific provisions concerning contractors’ obligations and (joint and several) liability with respect to compliance with the relevant terms and conditions of employment of posted workers by subcontractors. The focus is on preventive measures, combined with the possibility for Member States who so wish to implement more far-reaching systems of joint and several or chain liability. The provisions are limited to the construction sector, as defined by the list of activities included in the Annex to the Directive. Posting by temporary work agencies is included provided it is aimed at activities in the construction sector. However, Member States may, if they so wish, extend these provisions to other sectors. This balanced package of measures should reflect sufficiently the diversity of existing systems at national level, while at the same time avoiding adding unnecessary or unjustified administrative burden for companies. Joint and several liability is a mechanism of self-regulation between private actors and a far less restrictive and more proportionate system than possible alternative systems such as pure state intervention by inspections and sanctions. Cross-border enforcement of administrative fines and penalties : the absence of a common mutual recognition and enforcement instrument has been identified as causing major practical enforcement problems and difficulties. In a number of Member States the sanctions imposed are of a penal or criminal nature, whereas in others they are governed by administrative law, and a combination of the two can also be found. Existing EU instruments, such as Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA and the Brussels I Regulation, govern to a certain extent some of the fines and penalties imposed. With respect to fines and penalties of an administrative nature, which can be appealed to courts other than penal courts, similar instruments do not exist. Therefore, the proposal sets out a system for the cross-border enforcement of such administrative fines and penalties. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is expected to have implications for the EU budget: costs for grants (projects, seminars, exchange of good practice etc) of EUR 2 million as well as for the Expert Committee on the Posting of Workers of EUR 0. 264 million per year will be covered by PROGRESS (2013) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation (2014-2020); costs of EUR 0.5 million for an ex-post evaluation study in 2016 will be covered by the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; costs for human resources of EUR 0.232 million and other administrative expenditure (travel costs EUR 0.01 million; stakeholder conferences every second year EUR 0.36 million) will be covered under heading 5 of the Multiannual Financial Framework."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted in order to prevent or reduce the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment. Although plastic carrier bags constitute packaging within the meaning of that Directive, its provisions do not contain specific measures relating to the consumption of such bags. The use of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns, which are less frequently re-used than thicker plastic carrier bags, involves a considerable amount of litter, which will increase if measures are not taken. Consumption levels of plastic carrier bags vary considerably across the Union. Some Member States have managed to reduce consumption levels of plastic carrier bags significantly, with the average consumption level in the seven best performing Member States amounting to only 20% of the EU average consumption. To promote similar reductions of the average consumption level of lightweight plastic carrier bags, Member States should take measures to reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns in line with the overall objectives of the Union’s waste policy and the Union's waste hierarchy as provided for in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: instead of establishing a common EU target, it was considered preferable to introduce into Directive 94/62/EC the obligation for all Member States to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, while allowing them to set their own national reduction targets and to choose the measures to reach those targets. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 94/62/EC by requiring Member States to take measures to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. It stipulates that these measures may include the use of economic instruments as well as marketing restrictions in derogation of Article 18 of the Directive. The latter provision thus broadens the range of instruments available to Member States to address the unsustainable consumption of plastic bags. For the purpose of this Directive a definition of ""lightweight plastic carrier bags"" is introduced, and means bags made of plastic materials with a wall thickness below 50 microns that are supplied to consumers at the point of sale of goods or products."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the common rules for protection against dumped and subsidised imports from countries which are not members of the European Union are contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community respectively. The Regulations were initially adopted in 1995 following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Given that a number of amendments were made to them since then, the Council decided in 2009 to codify the regulations in the interest of clarity and rationality. Following a review launched by the Commission in 2011, it was considered that certain provisions of the Regulations should be amended in order to improve transparency and predictability, provide for effective measures to fight against retaliation, improve effectiveness and enforcement and optimise review practice. In addition, certain practices that in recent years have been applied in the context of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations should be included in the Regulations. This legislative proposal is issued in parallel with a Communication on the Modernisation of Trade Defence Instruments: Adapting trade defence instruments to the current needs of the European economy and draft guidelines on four important elements Union interest, injury margin, analogue country and expiry reviews of the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments (TDIs). The draft guidelines public consultation before they are adopted by the Commission. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: taking into account the results of a public consultation, an evaluation study and the Commission's extensive practice in the use of the instruments, an impact assessment was carried out in autumn 2012. The impact assessment report identified problems in the functioning of the trade defence instruments and proposed various solutions. The preferred solutions form the basis for this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under its legislative proposal, the Commission introduces what it considers to be a series of improvements to the current rules in relation to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures which may be summarised under five main headings: Enhanced transparency and predictability: interested parties, such as importers or users, would be informed two weeks in advance of the imposition of provisional measures that such measures are going to be imposed. Parties would also be given a guarantee that the measures will not be imposed within this two-week period. A summary of the basis on which it is intended to impose the measures would be sent to interested parties and they would have the opportunity to comment on the calculation of the dumping and injury margins. Calculation errors could then be corrected in advance of the imposition of measures. Furthermore, when it is decided not to impose provisional measures but to continue the investigation, interested parties would be informed of the intention not to impose such measures two weeks in advance of the ultimate date for imposition. Threats of retaliation against Union producers: in order to ensure effective measures to fight against retaliation, the proposal would enable Union producers to rely on the Regulations without fear of retaliation by third parties. Existing provisions, under special circumstances, provide for the initiation of an investigation without having received a complaint (“ex-officio”), where sufficient evidence of the existence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, injury and causal link exists. Such special circumstances should include threat of retaliation. Furthermore, when investigations are opened on an ex-officio basis, it is proposed to oblige Union producers to cooperate in the proceeding. Effectiveness of the instruments: according to the Commission, third countries increasingly interfere in trade of raw materials with a view to keeping raw materials in those countries for the benefit of domestic downstream users, for instance by imposing export taxes or operating dual pricing schemes. As a result, the costs of raw materials do not result from the operation of normal market forces reflecting supply and demand for a given raw material. Such interference creates additional distortions of trade. As a consequence, Union producers are not only harmed by dumping, but suffer, compared to downstream producers from third countries engaged in such practices, additional distortions of trade. In order to protect trade adequately, it is proposed to remove the lesser duty rule in cases of circumvention, or where structural raw material distortions have been found to exist, and subsidisation. Reviews: in order to optimise the review practice, it is proposed that duties collected during the investigation should be reimbursed to importers, where measures are not extended after the conclusion of an expiry review investigation. This is considered appropriate given that the conditions required for the continuation of the measures have not been found to exist during the investigation period. Lastly, there are a number of areas where it is proposed to codify certain practices which stem from ECJ or WTO rulings that have been handed down in recent years. These concern (i) the definition of Union industry, (ii) the consequences for exporting producers found not to be dumping or to be dumping at de-minimis levels in an original investigation, (iii) dealing with changed circumstances in a review investigation, (iv) the treatment of related companies in anti-circumvention investigations, (v) the conditions for the registration of imports, and (vi) the basis for choosing a sample of Union producers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has implications for the Union budget. The non-application of the lesser duty rule under certain circumstances will, in some cases, lead to higher duty levels and is thus revenue enhancing. The reimbursement of duties in cases where measures are terminated after an expiry review represents an expense for the Union budget. Quantification is, however, very difficult since any revenue or expense depends on the circumstances of each individual case. The cost of the upgrading of the SME helpdesk would amount to EUR 130 000 per year."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations - which will replace current Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 - contains new rules regarding, inter alia, the funding of political parties and political foundations at European level. Their effectiveness requires that they are accompanied by a corresponding set of financial rules anchored in the Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012). The proposal follows the European Parliament resolution of 6 April 2011 regarding the financing of the European political parties which considers that, in light of the experience gained, the financing of European political parties and European political foundations should be improved as regards a number of points. In particular, it calls for an end to the system of grants and the creation of a new financing instrument in the Financial Regulation “devoted solely and tailored specifically to the funding of European Parties and foundations”. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: after a detailed analysis, it is proposed that political parties should indeed be financed through a new instrument (""contributions"") rather than through an operating grant, as it is currently the case. As regards European political foundations, it is considered that they should continue to receive an operating grant. The Commission feels that the request of the European Parliament to exclude European political foundations also from the grant system is not justified given that the specific characteristics of European political parties are not the same as the European political foundations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof. CONTENT: the Commission proposal establishes a new Title VIII be inserted in part Two of the Financial Regulation dedicated to Contributions to European political parties and it repeals the specific provisions regarding European political parties which are currently provided for under Title VI (grants) of part One. The proposal introduces the following elements: Abolition of the ""annual work programme"": in accordance with Parliament’s resolution, the payment of contributions shall not be a precondition for the presentation of an annual work programme and an estimated operating budget. Introduction of eligibility criteria: the authorising officer should request directly from the Registry of European political parties (set up in the EP) certificates confirming that European political parties are duly registered and are in compliance with relevant obligations (e.g. presentation of accounts) and have not been suspended or subject to any administrative penalty as foreseen in the proposal for a Regulation on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations. Abolition of the selection criteria: the selection criteria will not be required in the new Title, since there is little value in verifying the financial and operational capacity of European political parties to represent its citizens, a fortiori when no annual work programme or estimated budget is submitted. Control on their statutory obligations: a provision has been introduced which will explicitly require that European political parties should not be subject to debarment from the Registry or subject to an administrative penalty during the financial year covered by the contribution. In such cases, their contributions would be reduced or terminated and any pre-financing paid recovered. The authorising officer should request such confirmation to the EP Registry before making the payment of the balance. Controls on expenditure and not on actions: while financial support should be awarded without an annual work programme and estimated operating budget, European political parties should justify ex post the sound use of Union funds. In particular, the authorising officer should verify if the EU funds have been used to pay reimbursable expenditure as established in the call for contributions within the time limits laid down in this Regulation. Time limits to use of EU funds: Parliament called for the possibility to 'build up reserves and carry-over of funds'. The new Title does not prevent European political parties from building reserves from their own sources. In addition, European political parties should also benefit from a certain flexibility regarding the time limits to use the EU funds awarded. However, EU funds that have not been spent should be used within a reasonable time. Financing and pre-financing methods: as in the case of grants, contributions may be paid either through the reimbursement of a percentage of the expenditures incurred or through a system of predefined lump sum, unit costs, and flat rate (forfaits). Contributions should be paid in one pre-financing payment covering 100% of the sum, unless the authorising officer decides otherwise for duly justified reasons. Interest on pre-financing: by derogation from the Financial Regulation, any interest yielded by the pre-financing amounts received by the European political parties should be used to pay reimbursable expenditures within the following two financial years. Penalty and control regime: as in the case for grants, the new Title should include the standard provisions regarding the control of the EP, OLAF, and the Court of Auditors. It should also include the same penalty regime (administrative and financial penalties) which is applicable to grant beneficiaries. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the envisaged modification of the Financial Regulation has no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the view of contributing to the EU 2020 Strategy, the 2011 Commission White Paper on Transport states that EU CO2 emissions from maritime transport should be reduced by 40% (if feasible 50%) from 2005 levels by 2050. In 2010 the total CO2 emissions related to European maritime transport activities (including intra EU routes, incoming voyages to the EU and outgoing voyages from the EU) were estimated to be of the order of 180 Mt CO2. Despite of the introduction of minimum energy efficiency standards for certain categories of new ships (""Energy Efficiency Design Index"", EEDI) by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2011, the emissions are expected to increase. The projected increase of CO2 emissions from shipping is not in line with the EU objectives , leading to negative impacts on climate change. Furthermore, at the EU level, international maritime transport remains the only transport mode not included in the EU's greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitment which requires additional efforts from all other sectors. Today, the precise amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions of EU-related maritime transport is not known due to the lack of monitoring and reporting of such emissions. Convinced of the need for a staged approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport, the Commission considers that a robust system for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport is a prerequisite for any market-based measure or efficiency standard, whether applied at EU level or globally. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the results of the impact assessment, the MRV only option would lead to more limited emission reductions estimated at up to 2% in 2030 (compared to the baseline) leading to cost reductions up to around EUR 1.2 billion in 2030. Costs of implementation are estimated at around EUR 26 million per year (when excluding ship below 5000 GT from the scope). Overall, the relative benefit/cost ratio of this option is very high. LEGAL BASIS: Article 162(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of the legislative proposal is to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from ships are monitored and reported, and therefore to improve the availability of information for policy and decision making in the context of the Union’s climate change commitments and provide incentives for mitigation efforts. To this effect, it is proposed to establish an EU MRV system for CO2 emission from ships as first step of a staged approach to reduce these emissions. The operational characteristics of the proposed MRV system are as follows: CO2 emissions from ships: the proposed measure focusses on CO2 emissions representing about 98% of the greenhouse gas emissions of the shipping sector and on large ships above 5000 Gross Tons (GT) which account for around 55% of the number of ships calling into Union ports and represent around 90% of the related emissions.. Minimise the administrative burden : the proposal aims to reduce the administrative burden as much as possible for ship owners and operators and provides to this effect that the annual calculation of CO2 emissions shall be based on fuel consumption and fuel type and energy efficiency using available data from log books, noon reports and bunker delivery notes. In addition, reporting and publication of reported information should be organised on an annual basis. Geographical scope : the following routes will in principle be covered in a non-discriminatory manner for all ships regardless their flag: intra-EU voyages; voyages from the last non-EU port to the first EU port of call (incoming voyages); voyages from an EU port to the next non-EU port of call (outgoing voyages). Verification of emission reports : the operational framework seeks the use of existing structures and bodies of the maritime sector, in particular recognised organisations to verify emission reports and to issue documents for compliance. Verification by accredited verifiers should ensure that monitoring plans and emission reports are correct and in compliance with the requirements defined by this Regulation. A document of compliance issued by an independent verifier will have to be carried on board ships and will be subject to inspection by Member State authorities. Towards a global system : given the Commission's clear preference for measures taken at global level, the EU MRV should serve as example for the implementation of a global MRV with the aim to speed up the international discussions. In this context, relevant submissions to the IMO will be made when appropriate. The proposal includes a provision allowing the Commission to review this Regulation in the context of future international developments, in particular in case of the introduction of a global MRV system through the IMO. In such an event the proposed Regulation should be reviewed and if appropriate amended to align the provisions on MRV with the international system. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Regulation will be implemented using the existing budget and will not have an impact on the multi-annual financial framework. Limited IT development costs for the necessary adjustment of an existing tool hosted and operated by EMSA of around EUR 0.5 million are expected. EMSA's involvement depends on the respective ancillary task of the agency to be activated and approved by the EMSA Board."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: it has been estimated that of the over 12 000 alien species that are found in the European environment, 10-15% have reproduced and spread, causing environmental, economic and social damage. Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the major, and growing, causes of biodiversity loss and species extinction. They can be vectors of diseases or directly cause health problems. They can damage infrastructure and recreational facilities, hamper forestry or cause agricultural losses, to mention but a few. IAS are estimated to cost the Union at least EUR 12 billion per year and damage costs are continuing to rise. The European Union currently lacks a comprehensive framework to address the threats posed by IAS . With the 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, the Union undertook to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020, in line with the international commitments adopted by the parties to the Convention for Biological Diversity in 2010 in Nagoya, Japan. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the baseline option (option 0), which would maintain the status quo, the following options were identified: Option 1 : Enhancing cooperation and supporting voluntary action. Option 2.1 : Basic legislative instrument. Option 2.2 : Basic legislative instrument + permits for release of IAS of Member State. Option 2.3 : Basic legislative instrument + a strict general ban on the release of alien species, unless found to be safe. Option 2.4 : Basic legislative instrument + an obligation for the rapid eradication of newly establishing IAS of Union concern : with this option, when it comes to rapid response, Member States would not have a choice, but rather an obligation to eradicate quickly any newly establishing IAS of Union concern and share information. Derogations are possible if approved by the Commission. Option 2.4 was retained and informs the present proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims to tackle the issues highlighted above by establishing a framework for action to prevent, minimise and mitigate the adverse impacts of IAS on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Furthermore, it will seek to limit social and economic damage. In practical terms, the proposal seeks to attain these objectives through measures addressing : (i) the intentional introduction of IAS into the Union and their intentional release into the environment; (ii) the unintentional introduction and release of IAS, the need to set up an early warning and rapid response system; (ii) the need to manage the IAS spread throughout the Union. The proposal: provides the tools for prioritising IAS of Union concern to enable Union resources to be prioritised on the basis of risk and scientific evidence; establishes the measures necessary to prevent the introduction into the Union and the introduction or release into the environment of IAS; sets out the tools to ensure that IAS of Union concern can be detected early in the environment and at the Union borders and describes the measures that are triggered when these IAS are detected; establishes the obligations necessary to tackle IAS of Union concern that are already present in the Union or new ones that have eluded the prevention measures and early detection measures and managed to spread widely. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary implication on the credit appropriations of an administrative nature is estimated at EUR 560 000 for the first seven years (2015-2021). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to the 2010 Commission report on the protection of the Union's financial interests, suspected fraud amounts to approximately 600 million euro annually on the revenue and expenditure side despite the legal framework in place. It can be assumed that the actual amount is even higher as not all cases are detected and reported. The damage to the EU budget calls for action to ensure equivalent and effective protection of the Union's financial interests, including criminal law as far as this proves necessary. Despite the development of an EU acquis in this area which includes fraud, corruption and money laundering, Member States have adopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection within their national legal systems. According to the Commission, the actual common definition of offences in all Member States would reduce the risks of divergent practice, as they would ensure a uniform interpretation and a homogeneous way to meet all the necessary prosecution requirements. They would also strengthen the deterrent effect and enforcement potential of relevant provisions The proposal follows on from the Commission’s May 2011 communication “On the protection of the Union’s financial interests by criminal law and by administrative investigations” and the September 2011 communication “Towards a European criminal policy: Ensuring the effective implementation of EU policies through criminal law”. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the outcome of an external study which was completed in February 2012. The impact assessment concludes that a solution which in particular would extend the types of some fraud-related offences, introduce minimum sanctions and harmonise statutory limitation is to be preferred. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces the proposal for a Directive on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests. It seeks to set out harmonised criminal law provisions in the field of the protection of the Union's financial interests, while allowing Member States a certain degree of flexibility as regards how to impose more stringent provisions. In particular, the proposal: introduces a definition of the Union’s financial interests (fraud in relation to VAT is considered as affecting the EU's financial interests and is therefore covered by this proposed Directive); provides a definition of fraudulent behaviour to be criminalised in the Member States; provides that dishonest conduct of tenderers in public procurement is to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of corruption to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of misappropriation, which covers conduct by public officials that does not constitute fraud in a stricter sense, and which consists in the misappropriation of funds or assets contrary to the purpose foreseen, with the intention to damage the Union's financial interests; makes reference to anti-money laundering legislation (Directive 2005/60/EC) with respect to money-laundering of the proceeds of the offences, so that such money laundering will be criminalised in the Member States; requires Member States to criminalise also forms of preparation of and participation in the offences of incitement, aiding and abetting, attempt; requires Member States to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons; requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, and to set out a certain minimum set of criminal sanctions for natural persons; requires certain minimum imprisonment terms for particularly serious offences, based on thresholds set out for each offence; requires the existence of means of freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities from these offences; requires the Member States to take the necessary measures to establish their competence bases in regard to criminal offences so as to allow the judicial authorities to initiate investigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to the Union's financial interests. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this proposal has no immediate budgetary implications for the Union. Its aim is, however, to prevent losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests by increasing deterrence and making enforcement by criminal law authorities of the Member States more effective, as well as to facilitate recovery in cases where losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests have already occurred."

JENSEN (ADLE, DK) on the draft Council regulation (EU, Euratom) laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources of the European Union. The committee recommended that the European Parliament should give its consent to the draft Council Regulation. To recall, the Implementing Regulation is part of the global package on the reform of the system of own resources presented by the Commission in June 2011 (and revised in November 2011). It contains provisions on determining the own resources, control and supervision and reporting requirements for national authorities. As outlined in the draft Council decision on the system of own resources the implementing regulation contains provisions of a general nature applicable to all types of own resources and which require appropriate parliamentary oversight. In the present draft Council regulation laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources of the European Union, the Council adapted the Commission's proposal from 2011 to the outcome of negotiations on the MFF/Own Resources, omitting the parts on the reform of the VAT own resource and the introduction of an FTT own resource that did not obtain Council's support."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: shrinking public budgets and the need for increased PES cost-effectiveness have prompted several Member States to undertake PES reforms in the shape of mergers with unemployment benefit providers, outsourcing of services to private providers, regionalisation and municipalisation of employment services, and enhancing service delivery through ICTs and self-service tools. Due to national diversity in terms of PES business models, instruments, labour market conditions and legal context PES have different levels of effectiveness when delivering labour market programmes. While Member States remain responsible for organising, staffing and running their PES, this legislative proposal establishes a European Network of Public Employment Services providing a platform for comparing their performance at European level, identifying good practices and fostering mutual learning in order to strengthen service capacity and efficiency. Skills : this legislative proposal aims to expand, reinforce and consolidate on-going initiatives for the benefit of all PES. A European network of PES established on solid legal ground would be able to increase comprehensively coordinated activities among PES and provide the network with legitimacy to act. A formalised structure is the pre-condition to increase the network’s potential to contribute to the development of innovative, evidence-based policy implementation measures in line with the Europe 2020 objectives. The proposed initiative could contribute to improved cost-efficiency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given that the legislative proposal will mostly have indirect impacts and that the main technical elements of the benchmarking and mutual learning initiative will be defined in a delegated act, an impact assessment was considered not to be proportionate. LEGAL BASIS: Article 149 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, an EU wide network of Public Employment Services (PES) is established for the period expanding from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The Network shall comprise: the Public Employment Services as nominated by the Member States, and, the Commission. Member States with regional autonomous Public Employment Services shall ensure adequate representation in the specific initiatives of the Network. Objectives : through this Network the incentive measure herewith foreseen shall contribute to: the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and its headline targets especially those dealing with employment; the better functioning of the labour markets in the EU; the better integration of labour markets; increased geographical and occupational mobility; combatting of social exclusion and integration of persons excluded from the labour market. Initiatives of the Network : the Network shall in particular: develop and implement European wide evidence-based benchmarking systems among public employment services based on the use of quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess PES performances and to gather evidence with a view to establishing an appropriate mutual learning vehicle. It shall also participate actively in the implementation of these activities by sharing data, knowledge and practices; provide mutual assistance, either in the form of peer-to-peer or group activities, through cooperation, exchanges of information, experience and staff between its members including support for the implementation of PES-related country-specific recommendations issued by the Council; adopt and implement a concept for modernising and strengthening PES in key areas; prepare reports in the employment field, at the request of either the Council, or the Commission or on its own initiative; contribute to the implementation of policy initiatives in the employment field; adopt and implement an annual programme that spells out its working methods, deliverables and additional details related to the implementation of the benchmarking systems. A reporting mechanism shall be established as well as an annual report from the network members. Cooperation : the Network shall cooperate with labour market stakeholders including other providers of employment services by involving them in relevant activities and meetings of the Network and by exchanging information and data. Financial Support for this incentive measure : the global resources for the implementation of this Decision shall be established within the framework of the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, the annual appropriations of which shall be authorised by the budgetary authority. Measures are also set out to define the functioning of the Network and its composition. General framework : the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts concerning a general framework for the delivery of the benchmarking and mutual learning initiatives including the methodology, the basic quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess PES performance, the learning instruments of the integrated mutual learning programme and the terms for participation in these initiatives. Review : four years after its entry into force, the Commission shall submit a report on the application of this Decision to the European Parliament. It shall assess to what extent the network has contributed to the achievement of the objectives and whether it fulfilled its tasks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission's proposal for a Multi-Annual Financial Framework includes a proposal of a EUR 958. 19 million on a European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation (PSCI) for the period 2014-2020. Funding for the enhanced cooperation between PES will come from the PSCI/PROGRESS/Employment section. An indicative annual amount of EUR 4 million is foreseen for the above described incentive measure. The legislative proposal is budget-neutral and does not require additional staff resources. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal includes a provision to grant the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts. This will mainly concern a delegated act for putting in place the general framework for the implementation of the benchmarking and mutual learning initiatives. The choice of using the legal instrument of delegated acts is justified as this will complement the basic act with more detailed non-essential elements (in this case the general framework)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was created in 2002 to enable the EU to respond to major disasters inside the EU and in countries involved in accession negotiations. The instrument is generally meeting its objectives well but is considered not to be sufficiently responsive and visible and as far as certain criteria for its activation are concerned too complicated and not sufficiently clear. In 2005, the Commission presented a proposal for a new EUSF Regulation. While the proposal was favourably received by the European Parliament, it was not adopted in the Council. The Commission officially withdrew the proposal in June 2012. In October 2011, the Commission presented a Communication on the Future of the Solidarity Fund which contains an evaluation of the operations of the current instrument and proposes options for improving its functioning. This proposal is situated in the context of the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020. Moreover, the proposal complements the recent common proposal of the Commission and the High Representative for implementing arrangements of the Solidarity Clause enshrined in Article 222 TFEU which underlines the role of the Solidarity Fund as one of the key Union instruments in applying this provision of the Treaty. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. However, The 2011 Communication served as a basis for discussions with the Member States and the European Parliament and other stakeholders. LEGAL BASIS: the third subparagraph of Article 175 and Article 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the main objective of the proposal is to improve the functioning of the existing Solidarity Fund instrument by making it quicker to respond and more visible to citizens, simpler to use and its provisions clearer. This is to be achieved by a limited number of technical adjustments to the Regulation. The principles of the instrument remain unchanged as do its financing method outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the likely level of spending. The proposal contains those adjustments to the EUSF-Regulation that were discussed in the 2011 Communication on the Future of the Solidarity Fund: Scope : a clearer definition of the scope of the EUSF limited to natural disasters including man-made disaster that are the direct consequence of a natural disaster (cascading effects). This will eliminate existing legal uncertainties about the scope and thus avoid that applications are presented which do not meet the conditions. Exceptional mobilisation : a new and simple single criterion for the exceptional mobilisation of the EUSF for so-called extraordinary regional disasters based on a GDP-related threshold has been introduced. The lack of clarity under the current provisions about the conditions for exceptionally mobilising the EUSF will be eliminated by setting the damage threshold for regional disasters at 1.5% of GDP at NUTS 2 level. This will considerably simplify and speed up the preparation of applications by eligible States and their assessment by the Commission. At the same time it will significantly reduce the number of rejected applications as applicants will know from the outset whether the criterion is met. Advanced payments : the introduction of the possibility to make rapid advance payments upon request of the affected Member State, limited to 10% of the expected amount of the financial aid capped at EUR 30 million. Recoveries from the Member States from the Solidarity Fund and from the Cohesion Instruments (ERDF and Cohesion Fund) up to a maximum annual amount should be made available to the Solidarity Fund as assigned revenue in order to make commitments for advance payments available in the Union budget. In addition to including a specific provision in the Solidarity Fund Regulation this will also require including a provision in the Common Provisions Regulation relating to the Cohesion Policy Funds and in the transitional provisions relating to the current programming period. It is envisaged that the Commission will present an amending proposal to be adopted at the same time as the present proposal. Starting dates : the proposal includes a specific provision for slowly unfolding disasters such as drought. Defining the start of such disasters as the date at which the public authorities took the first counter-measures will eliminate legal difficulties stemming from the current obligation to submit applications within 10 weeks of the date of the first damage. Disaster prevention : provisions are included to encourage more effective disaster prevention, including full implementation of relevant Union legislation on prevention, the use of available Union funding for related investments and improved reporting on these actions. In the event that a disaster of the same nature as one for which the Fund was previously mobilised should occur and Union legislation has not been complied with, the Commission will seriously consider rejecting a new application or granting a reduced amount of aid only. Awarding aid : it is proposed to merge the decision awarding the aid and the implementation agreements into a single act. This administrative measure will help to speed up the processing of applications inside the Commission and therefore allow paying out aid more rapidly. Moreover, a number of further elements were included in the proposal, such as: a specific provision on the eligibility of VAT and the exclusion of Technical Assistance, a provision requiring respect for the Union acquis, a revised provision to avoid double financing, extended ex-post reporting on prevention measures, a provision on the use of the Euro and its conversion into national currencies. Further modifications : a number of modifications are introduced to bring the Regulation in line with the Financial Regulation as amended in 2012. This concerns not only terminology but in particular certain rules and obligations in relation the implementation of the Fund by Member States under the principle of shared management and by eligible candidate countries (countries negotiating the accession to the Union) under the principle of indirect management. In order not to put at risk the objectives of the Fund, i.e. to make financial assistance available as quickly as possible after the occurrence of a major disaster, it is however necessary to derogate from certain provisions of the Financial Regulation, in particular as concerns the normally time-consuming process of designating the implementing authorities, including those for audit and control, as well as regarding the timing of annual reporting. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the EUSF is not budgeted. Actual spending will depend on applications for aid submitted by eligible States following the (unpredictable) occurrence of natural disasters and the maximum amount of annual allocation available to the Fund as decided in the IIA. The proposal takes account of the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014 – 2020 which foresees maintaining the current mechanism whereby the necessary budgetary resources for awarding financial aid are raised over and above the MFF ceilings by a decision of the budget authority within a maximum annual allocation of EUR 500 million (2011 prices). The decision to express the maximum annual allocation of the Fund in 2011 prices (instead of current prices) is mirrored in the proposal by applying the same basis to the amount of EUR 3 billion which is one of the two damage threshold for defining 'major disasters'. The other threshold defined as 0.6% of gross national income is not affected. In cases where an advance has been paid its amount will be taken into account when the final contribution from the Fund is paid out."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Investment Fund (EIF) was founded in 1994 to stimulate sustained and balanced growth within the Community. Its statutory goal to support EU policies has been reflected in the exceptional growth of both equity investments and guarantees during the recent crisis. Following the capital increase of the EIF in 2007, the subscribed capital amounts to EUR 3 billion divided into 3 000 shares each with a nominal value of EUR 1 million. The paid-in capital of the EIF is currently EUR 600 million (i.e. 20 % of subscribed capital). Consequently, the Union, represented by the Commission, is currently subscribed to in total 900 shares of the Fund for a nominal value of EUR 900 million, of which EUR 180 million are paid-in. As of October 2013, the EIF is owned by the EIB (62.1 %), the European Union (30 %) and 24 public and private financial institutions (7.9 %). Recalling that restoring normal lending to the economy, in particular to SMEs, remains a priority, the European Council of December 2013 called on the Commission and the EIB to further enhance the capacity of the Fund through an increase in its capital with a view to reaching final agreement by May 2014. The current size of Fund's own funds does not allow for a substantial increase in the Fund's activity, as the guarantee and venture capital operations of the Fund may not exceed the ceilings set by the Statutes of the Fund or by the General Meeting of the Fund. Furthermore, the credit enhancement capacity of the Fund is limited by the size of its available own funds. Accordingly, on 26 November 2013, the EIF Board of Directors approved the increase in the EIF subscribed capital by up to EUR 1,500 million, of which 20 % will be paid-in. This would imply the subscription of 450 additional shares by the EU. CONTENT: the draft decision provides that in addition to its current shareholding in the EIF, the Union shall subscribe for up to 450 shares each of a nominal value of EUR 1 million in the Fund. The subscription of shares and the annual payments shall be carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions that shall be approved by the General Meeting of the Fund. In addition: · the Union shall purchase the new shares in the Fund over a four-year period starting in 2014; · during 2014 to 2017, the dividends received for the participation of the Union in the Fund shall be considered as external assigned revenue, in accordance with Regulation No 966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, to cover part of the cost of subscription; · a total amount of up to EUR 170 million for the whole period shall be available within the general budget of the European Union to cover the remaining cost, making use of appropriations already programmed within Heading 1a of the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020 in order to leave unchanged the total expenditure allocated. The budgetary commitment may be broken down into annual instalments over four years in accordance with Regulation No 966/2012. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the resources needed for the purchase of 450 shares are estimated at approximately EUR 175 million. The Commission proposes that the dividends which will be paid by the EIF during the years 2014-2017 will be used to cover part of the cost of the new shares. Assuming the 2013 level of the dividend pay-out ratio of 20 % to remain constant for the next four years, the dividends to be received during this period are estimated at around EUR 11.5 million. However, it needs to be stressed that the EIF uses a dividend pay-out ratio of 33% as a working assumption for their calculations in the document proposing EIF's capital increase to its Board of Directors. If this level of dividends was assumed, the purchase of 450 shares would require approx. EUR 172 million and the estimated dividends received during 2014-2017 would reach approx. EUR 19 million. The dividends are decided annually by the General Meeting of the EIF. Consequently, at this stage both the share issue price and the level of dividends cannot be calculated exactly for the whole period of subscription. In any case, the price to be paid by the EU for its part of the increase is not expected to exceed the sum of indicative budget appropriation for EUR 170 million plus the dividends received during 2014-2017. The Commission proposes to make use of appropriations already programmed for financial instruments under COSME and Horizon 2020 programmes to enhance access to financing for SMEs. Since both the COSME Regulation and the Horizon 2020 Regulation aim to assist SMEs, it is proposed to use part of the appropriations available for COSME and Horizon 2020 for the proposed EIF capital increase. The necessary adjustment to the 2014 budget will be proposed separately in a draft amending budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Tunisian economy has been negatively affected by the domestic unrest that followed the 2011 revolution, regional instability (notably the war in Libya). In particular, the fiscal and balance of payments situation has deteriorated quite markedly, generating important financing needs. At the same time, following the ousting of President Ben Ali on 14 January 2011, the country is taking significant steps towards the establishment of democratic mechanisms. However, the political transition has not been without difficulties and episodes of instability. Against this background, the Tunisian authorities reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion (400% of quota), which was approved by the IMF Board in June. The aim of the SBA is to support the government’s economic reform programme, reduce economic vulnerabilities and foster sustainable and inclusive growth. In this context, the Tunisian government requested Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million on 28 August 2013, with a portion in the form of a grant. The European Commission submits to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal to grant a MFA to the Republic of Tunisia amounting to a maximum of EUR 250 million. The assistance would take the form of medium-term loans, with no grant component being envisaged given that Tunisia does not meet the eligibility criteria for the use of grants in MFA operations. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make available to Tunisia MFA for a total maximum amount of EUR 250 million in order to: contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2014-15; support the fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of the IMF programme; facilitate and encourage efforts of the authorities of Tunisia to implement measures identified under the EU-Tunisia ENP Action Plan, and; support structural reform efforts aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management, strengthening economic governance and transparency, and improving conditions for sustainable growth. The full amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Tunisia in the form of loans. The loans shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. The Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions and to on-lend them to Tunisia. Disbursement of assistance : the assistance is planned to be disbursed in three loan instalments: - the disbursement of the first instalment (EUR 90 million) is expected to take place in mid-2014; - the second instalment (EUR 80 million), conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed towards the end of 2014; - the third and last instalment (EUR 80 million) could be made available, provided the policy measures are met, during the first half of 2015. Implementing conditions : respects effective democratic mechanisms : a pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that Tunisia respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. Both fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission; release of the Union's macro-financial assistance : this shall be managed by the Commission in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Tunisia; implementing reforms : the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment). The proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Decreased assistance : where the financing needs of Tunisia decrease fundamentally during the period of the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance compared to the initial projections, the Commission, acting in accordance with the examination procedure, shall reduce the amount of the assistance or suspend or cancel it. Where the circumstances permit, and if Tunisia so requests, the Commission may take the steps necessary to ensure that an early repayment clause is included in the loan terms and conditions and that it is matched by a corresponding clause in the terms and conditions of the borrowing operations. Implementing conditions : in order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the Tunisian authorities under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used for operations above that threshold as well as to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the assistance. Reports : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation. Not later than two years after the expiry of the availability period, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council an ex post evaluation report, assessing the results and efficiency of the completed Union's macro-financial assistance and the extent to which it has contributed to the aims of the assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (""the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2014 for a total amount of EUR 170 million and the third loan disbursement in 2015 for the amount of EUR 80 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2016-17 budgets."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF PARLIAMENT : the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the EU is a Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (""the Convention""), which established the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (""ICCAT""). At its 16th Special Meeting in 2008, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 08-05 to establish a new recovery plan for Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, and Regulation (EC) No 302/20095 was adopted to implement those international conservation measures at Union level. This was later amended by Regulation (EU) No 500/2012. At its 18th Special Meeting in 2012, ICCAT adopted Recommendation 12-03, which provides for: · a modification of the fishing seasons; · defining fishing seasons as open seasons, as opposed to closed seasons indicated in the previous ICCAT Recommendations; · a modification of the actual dates when fishing is permitted by purse seiners, bait boats and trolling boats; · explicitly allowing all other gears the possibility of fishing all year round to avoid any uncertainty for those gears which are not subject to any specific rules on fishing seasons. Pending the entry into force of ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 and its comprehensive implementation, this proposal aims to modify the provisions on fishing seasons in Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 in order to ensure effective conservation of the bluefin tunastock. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. Member States concerned by this fishery (Cyprus, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Malta and Portugal) were consulted on 11th December 2012 on the need to clarify the dates of the fishing season, and are agreed on the modifications to the dates of the fishing season. LEGAL BASIS : Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union CONTENT : this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 to reflect ICCAT Recommendation 12-03 regarding fishing seasons. Fishing seasons : bluefin tuna fishing will be permitted in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean: · by large-scale pelagic long line catching vessels over 24 m during the period from 1 January to 31 May with the exception of the area delimited by West of 10◦W and North of 42◦N, where such fishing shall be permitted from 1 August to 31 January; · by purse seine fishing during the period from 26 May to 24 June; · by bait boats and trolling boats during the period from 1 July to 31 October; · by pelagic trawlers in the eastern Atlantic during the period from 16 June to 14 October ; · as recreational and sport fishing from 16 June to 14 October. Fishing for Bluefin tuna by other gears than those mentioned above will be permitted throughout the year. Date of application: this amendment will apply with retroactive effect from 1 January 2013. This will allow Member States properly to define their fishing capacity and inspection plans which are linked to the fishing seasons and ensure legal certainty. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no impact on the EU budget."

PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: BACKGROUND: the euro continues to be a target of organised crime groups active in the forgery of money. Counterfeiting of the euro has led to a financial damage of at least EUR 500 million since the introduction of the euro in 2002. Europol considers that there is a long-term trend towards an increase in the crime level and notes that the criminal threat remains serious. Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA on increasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro aims at supplementing, on the territory of European Union, the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1929 which lays down rules ensuring that severe criminal penalties and other sanctions can be imposed for offences of counterfeiting currency. Although all Member States have, with minor exceptions, formally implemented the Framework Decision correctly, Member States have adopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection and practices within their national legal systems. In particular, considerable differences exist with respect to the levels of sanctions which are applicable in the Member States to the main forms of counterfeiting. It is therefore essential to ensure that effective and efficient criminal law measures protect the euro and any other currency whose circulation is legally authorised in all Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the consultations of the interested parties. After considering the possible options, the impact assessment concludes that the following solution would be preferred: (i) maintenance of most of the provisions from Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA in a new proposal, with minor modifications, taking into account the Treaty of Lisbon; (ii) modification of the provisions on penalties; and (iii) introduction of a new provision obliging Member States to provide for the possibility to use certain investigative tools. LEGAL BASIS: Article 83 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of this Directive is to supplement the provisions and to facilitate the application of the Geneva Convention by the Member States. It builds on and updates Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA seeking to increase protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro. The proposal: · requires Member States to criminalise all forms of preparation and participation. Criminal responsibility for attempt is included for the majority of offences; · requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. For more serious cases of the offences of production and distribution of counterfeit currency, it sets out a sanction of imprisonment within a range of at least six months and eight years for natural persons; · requires Member States to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons, and to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions on legal persons; · requires jurisdiction of the judicial authorities which allow them to initiate investigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to currency counterfeiting; · obliges Member States whose currency is the euro to exercise universal jurisdiction on euro counterfeiting offences under certain conditions; · ensures that investigative tools which are provided for in national law for organised crime or other serious crime cases can also be used in cases of counterfeiting of currency; · requires from Member States to ensure that the National Analysis Centres and the National Coin Analysis Centres can analyse euro counterfeits also during on-going judicial proceedings for the purpose of detecting further counterfeits; · requests that Member States are contracting parties of the International Geneva Convention of 20 April 1929. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Budget of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: ·  Article 290 of the TFUE allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts); ·  Article 291 of the TFUE allows Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts (implementing acts). Following a reference for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC for the Bayerischer Verwaltungsgerichtshof (case C-442/09), the Court of Justice issued a ruling, whereby it qualifies pollen in honey as an ingredient within the meaning of Article 6(4)(a) of Directive 2000/13/EC on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs. In light of these considerations, a draft proposal amending Directive 2001/110/EC has been prepared. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no significant changes for interested parties are expected and for this reason, no impact assessment has been carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 TFEU. CONTENT : the proposal aims to: ·  identify the delegated and implementing powers that should be conferred upon the Commission as regards Directive 2001/110/EC and establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of this act in the new legal context determined by the entry into force of Articles 290 and 291 TFUE; ·  clarify, in view of the judgement of the Court of Justice in Case C-442/09, that pollen in honey is not an ingredient in the sense of Article 6(4)(a) of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, but is a constituent of honey, which is a natural substance that has no ingredients. This clarification will not prevent the applicability of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 to honey containing GM pollen, and in particular will not affect the conclusion of the Court of Justice that honey containing GM pollen can be placed on the market only if it is covered by an authorisation in accordance with that Regulation.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission adopted on October 6th 2011 a proposal for a ""Common Provisions"" Regulation which lays down common rules for the shared-management funds, with the main aim of simplification of policy delivery. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (CSF Funds) pursue complementary objectives and share the same management mode. The ""Common Provisions"" Regulation sets out a series of common rules for these funds. The Commission proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020 adopted on 29 June 2011 set the budgetary framework and main orientations for the funding of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). This proposal for the Regulation on European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) aims at achieving the objectives of the reformed CFP and of IMP. It is based on these objectives, re-defined in terms of funding: §  promotion of sustainable and competitive fisheries and aquaculture; §  fostering the development and implementation of the Union's Integrated Maritime Policy, in a complementary manner to cohesion policy and to CFP; §  promotion of balanced and inclusive territorial development of fisheries areas (including aquaculture and inland fishing); §  contribution to the implementation of the CFP. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: on the basis of the FIFG ex-post evaluation, the interim evaluation of the EFF and the impact assessment for the CFP reform, the impact assessment of the EMFF assesses three alternative scenarios: the ""EFF+"", which is a continuation of the current EFF without most of the direct fleet subsidies and the support focused on the objectives of the CFP reform; the ""EFF+ integration "", in which the other CFP funding instruments are integrated into a post EFF fund, but keep the same management mode as today and the ""EFF+ convergence"" in which support to IMP is also integrated under the new single fund and all the instruments are brought to the extent possible under the shared management. The impact assessment concluded that the ""EFF+ Convergence"" performs better than the two other options on the three impact indicators chosen for the analysis: (i) the reduction of the impact of fisheries on the environment; (ii) the closure of the innovation gap in fisheries and aquaculture and (iii) the number of jobs created in communities dependent on fisheries. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that most of the current CFP and IMP financial instruments be integrated into one fund, with the exception of Sustainable Fisheries Agreements (SFAs) and the compulsory contribution to RFMOs. EMFF focuses on CFP and IMP long-term strategic objectives including sustainable and competitive fisheries and aquaculture, consistent policy framework for the further development of IMP and balanced and inclusive territorial development of fisheries areas. The EMFF is structured around 4 pillars: §  Smart, green Fisheries (shared management) to foster the transition to sustainable fishing which is more selective, produces no discards, does less damage to marine ecosystems and thus contributes to the sustainable management of marine ecosystems; and to provide support focused on innovation and value added, making the fisheries sector economically viable and resilient to external shocks and to competition from third countries. §  Smart, green Aquaculture (shared management) - to achieve economically viable, competitive and green aquaculture, capable of facing global competition and providing EU consumers with healthy and high nutrition value products. §  Sustainable and inclusive territorial development (shared management) - to reverse the decline of many coastal and inland communities dependent on fishing, through adding more value to fishing and fishing related activities and through diversification to other sectors of the maritime economy. §  Integrated Maritime Policy (direct centralised management) to support those cross cutting priorities which generate savings and growth but which the Member States will not take forward on their own – such as marine knowledge, maritime spatial planning, integrated coastal zone management and integrated maritime surveillance, the protection of the marine environment, in particular its biodiversity, and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change on coastal areas. In addition to the four pillars, the EMFF will include accompanying measures: data collection and scientific advice, control, governance, fisheries markets (including outermost regions), voluntary payments to RFMOs and technical assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the envelope for 2014-2020, in current prices, is set at EUR 7,535 billion, including SFAs and the compulsory contributions to RFMOs, which will be funded separately. The EMFF budget amounts, in current prices to EUR 6567 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

BACKGROUND: according to Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College (CEPOL), CEPOL has its seat in Bramshill, United Kingdom. By letters of 12 December 2012 and 8 February 2013, the United Kingdom informed CEPOL that it no longer wishes to host the seat on its territory. Apart from hosting CEPOL, Bramshill also hosts a national police training site of the National Policing Improvement Agency which the United Kingdom decided to replace by a new College of Policing to be located elsewhere. The United Kingdom has therefore decided to close the national police training site at Bramshill and to sell the site indicating that the related costs were high and no alternative business model to run the site had emerged. In view of this situation, on 8 October 2013, the Council agreed by common accord on arrangements to host CEPOL according to which CEPOL will be hosted in Budapest as soon as it moves from Bramshill. This agreement should be incorporated in Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment of locating CEPOL seat in Budapest demonstrates that the proposal complies with the pertinent criteria, allowing the European Parliament and the Council to assess the impact of the relocation and the functioning of CEPOL in Budapest. The assessment addresses those factors in detail that: have a financial impact on the general budget of the European Union and cover social aspects of the work of CEPOL staff members. Moreover, the headquarters offered by Hungary for the purposes of the seat of the CEPOL are situated in the city centre of Budapest. Due to the central location of Budapest, it is easily accessible from most European capitals by cost-effective flights. The building proposed satisfies the requirements laid down by Secretariat of CEPOL. Hungary also proposes to offer, free of charge, a number of services and installations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA and proposes the new seat of CEPOL to be established in Budapest, Hungary. The specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to estimated savings in CEPOL’s functioning costs per year due to the proposed relocation from Bramshill to Budapest as well as an estimated tentative budgetary calculation of the one-off expenditure of the relocation. The savings amount to EUR 203 500/year. The estimated tentative budgetary calculation of the one-off expenditure for relocating CEPOL from Bramshill to Budapest amounts to EUR 1 875 449."

PROPOSED ACT : Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the ultimate aim of maritime spatial planning is to draw up plans to identify the utilisation of maritime space for different sea uses. Maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management are complementary tools. Applied jointly, they improve sea-land interface planning and management. Increased use of coastal and maritime areas as well as climate change effects, natural hazards, and erosion, put pressure on coastal and marine resources. They require integrated and coherent management to secure sustainable growth and preserve coastal and marine ecosystems for future generations. In 2008, the Commission published its ‘Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning: achieving common principles in the EU’, followed by a 2010 Communication entitled ‘Maritime Spatial Planning in the EU — achievements and future development’. This draft directive is an essential part of the ambition to develop the EU’s Blue Economy as described in the Commission Communication on Blue growth: opportunities for marine and maritime sustainable growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment evaluated the effectiveness and the economic, environmental and social impacts of three options: (1) guidance and development of best practice, (2) non-binding measures, and (3) legally binding measures, including a ‘framework-type’ directive or regulation. The impact assessment concluded that, even though non-binding options offer some advantages, a legally binding approach by means of a directive is the most appropriate instrument in order to: ·  ensure predictability, stability, and transparency of maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management, whilst leaving flexibility for implementation to Member States and not interfering with the latter’s competences; ·  ensure that timelines for implementation are coherent with the timeframes of other relevant EU legislation and policy initiatives (e.g. Renewable Energy Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Europe 2020 targets, etc.); ·  foster growth of economic activities at sea in a context of increased competition for space. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 43(2), 100(2), 192(1), and 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the main purpose of the proposed directive is to promote the sustainable growth of maritime and coastal activities and the sustainable use of coastal and marine resources by establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management in the form of a systematic, coordinated, inclusive and trans-boundary approach to integrated maritime governance. To ensure the sustainability and environmental health of the various uses, maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management will have to employ an ecosystem-based approach that ensures the protection of the natural resources that provide the basis for carrying out various activities. The proposed action covers all policy areas of the TFEU with an impact on coasts, seas and oceans. The proposal: ·  obliges Member States to carry out maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management in accordance with national and international law. The aim of the action is for Member States to establish a process or processes that cover the full cycle of problem identification, information collection, planning, decision-making, management, monitoring of implementation, and stakeholder participation. Planning details and the determination of management objectives are left to Member States. The EU will not take part in this process; ·  requires Member States’ actions to aim for coherence of management across sea basins, through trans-boundary cooperation in the same marine region or sub-region and related coastal zone and appropriate data collection and exchange. Implementing acts will ensure consistent implementation of the Directive throughout the EU and facilitate reporting from the Member States to the Commission and, where relevant, the exchange of data between Member States and with the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: damages claims for breaches of Articles 101 or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) constitute an important area of private enforcement of EU competition law. The Court of Justice of the European Union has clarified that the full effectiveness of the EU competition rules and, in particular, the practical effect of the prohibitions they contain would be put at risk if it were not open to any person to claim damages for loss caused to him/her by a contract or conduct liable to restrict or distort competition. It considered that damages actions strengthen the working of the EU competition rules and can thus make a significant contribution to maintaining effective competition in the EU. While the right to full compensation is guaranteed by the Treaty itself, the practical exercise of this right is often rendered difficult or almost impossible because of the applicable rules and procedures. Despite some recent signs of improvement in a few Member States, to date most victims of infringements of the EU competition rules in practice do not obtain compensation for the harm suffered. Besides these specific substantive obstacles to effective compensation (already identified in the Commission’s 2005 Green Paper), there is a wide diversity as regards the national legal rules governing antitrust damages actions. To remedy this situation, the Commission put forward concrete policy proposals in its 2008 White Paper. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment report focused on four options which ranged from no action at the EU level, through a soft-law approach, to two options for legally binding EU action. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 103 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to ensure the effective enforcement of the EU competition rules in particular by ensuring that victims of infringements of the EU competition rules can obtain full compensation for the harm they suffered. Scope: the proposed Directive would set out rules ensuring equivalent protection throughout the Union for all natural or legal persons for harm they they have suffered as a result of infringements of the EU competition rules and ensure that their right under EU law to full compensation can be effectively exercised in the national courts. Disclosure of evidence: provision is made to ensure that, under certain conditions, the national courts can order the defendant or a third party to disclose the evidence a claimant will need to prove his his antitrust damages claim and/or a related defence. National courts should have at their disposal effective measures to protect any business secrets or otherwise confidential information disclosed during the proceedings. Furthermore, disclosure should not be allowed where it would be contrary to certain rights and obligations such as the obligation of professional secrecy. Probative effect of national decisions: pursuant to Council Regulation No 1/2003, a Commission decision relating to proceedings under Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty has a probative effect in subsequent actions for damages. It is proposed to give final infringement decisions by national competition authorities (or by a national review court) similar effect. Limitation periods: the Commission proposes that the national rules on limitation periods for a damages action: (i) allow victims sufficient time (at least five years) to bring an action after they became aware of the infringement, the harm it caused and the identity of the infringer; (ii) prevent a limitation period from starting to run before the day on which a continuous or repeated infringement ceases. Joint and several liability: where several undertakings infringe the competition rules jointly (typically in the case of a cartel), it is appropriate that they be jointly and severally liable for the entire harm caused by the infringement. The new proposal, however, introduces certain modifications with regard to the liability regime of immunity recipients. Passing-on of overcharges: i njured parties are entitled to compensation for actual loss (overcharge harm) and for loss of profit. To ensure that only the direct and indirect purchasers that actually suffered overcharge harm can effectively claim compensation, the proposed Directive explicitly recognises the possibility for the infringing undertaking to invoke the passing-on defence. However, in situations where the overcharge was passed on to natural or legal persons at the next level of the supply chain for whom it is legally impossible to claim compensation, the passing-on defence cannot be invoked. Quantification of harm: to assist victims of a cartel in quantifying the harm caused by the competition law infringement, the proposed Directive provides for a rebuttable presumption with regard to the existence of harm resulting from a cartel. The infringing undertaking could rebut this presumption and use the evidence at its disposal to prove that the cartel did not cause harm. Consensual Dispute Resolution: to provide an incentive to parties to settle their dispute consensually, the proposed Directive aims at optimising the balance between out-of-court settlements and actions for damages. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed Directive would have no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on shipments of waste (WSR) lays down requirements for shipments of waste both within the Union and between the Member States and third countries, in order to protect the environment. However, gaps have been identified in the enforcement and inspections carried out by the competent authorities in Member States due to, inter alia, a lack of clear provisions in the Regulation on these matters. Illegal waste shipments are a serious and frequent problem. In 2011 a study estimated the tonnage of illegal shipments within and out of the EU to be 2.8 million tonnes per year. The most problematic illegal waste shipments are those concerning hazardous waste and waste which is illegally sent for dumping or sub-standard treatment. The export bans for hazardous waste and waste for disposal under the WSR are often circumvented. The joint inspections carried out by the ""network for the implementation and enforcement of environmental law, trans-frontier shipments of waste-cluster"" (IMPEL-tfs) revealed very high rates of non-compliance with the WSR due to illegal waste shipments. During the period October 2008-November 2010, the overall non-compliance rate can be estimated to be 25%. Council conclusions of 3 June 2010 invited the Commission, inter alia, to consider strengthening EU requirements on inspections and spot checks carried out under the WSR. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission’s impact assessment examined several options to strengthen inspections and enforcement of the WSR. The assessment concluded that a combination of EU legislative requirements and guidance would be the most effective option to address the problems related to illegal waste shipments. This option would also have the lowest net costs and the most positive economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 aims to help ensure more uniform implementation of the WSR through establishing minimum inspection requirements throughout the EU with a focus on problematic waste streams. More specifically, the proposal seeks to: strengthen the provisions regarding the enforcement of rules and inspections covered by Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 with a view to ensuring regular and consistent planning of inspections . Planning should include a number of key elements, including risk assessments, strategies, objectives, priorities, numbers and types of planned inspections, assignment of tasks, means of cooperation between authorities and provisions on training of inspectors; introduce the possibility for competent authorities in Member States to require evidence from waste exporters in order to check the legality of shipments . Such evidence may concern whether the substance or object is ""waste"" or not, whether the shipment is destined for recovery or disposal, or the nature of the specific waste treatment methods and standards applied by the facility in the country of destination. The Commission may adopt guidelines for the enforcement of the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no incidence on the EU’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
