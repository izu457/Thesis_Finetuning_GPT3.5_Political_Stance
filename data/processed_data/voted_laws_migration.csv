canada political ties and cooperation on foreign and security issues, and to advance cooperation on a large number of policy areas besides trade and economics. the agreement enshrines eu-canada common democratic values and will advance cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral level. the spa will strengthen political dialogue in fields such as: it reaffirms the parties' commitment to safeguarding international peace and security by preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and undertaking measures to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. institutional cooperation: the spa provides the mechanism for conducting political dialogue by organising annual summits at leaders level and consultations at ministerial level. it also establishes a joint ministerial committee, which replaces the previous transatlantic dialogue, and a joint cooperation committee with the objective of monitoring the development of the strategic relationship between the parties. suspension mechanism: the agreement provides for the possibility of suspending its application in case of a violation of essential elements of the agreement such as human rights and non-proliferation. in addition, the parties recognise that a particularly serious and substantial violation of human rights or non-proliferation could also serve as grounds for the termination of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (ceta). the spa, in conjunction with the ceta, is expected to provide tangible benefits and opportunities to the citizens of the eu and canada.

to conclude an agreement between the european union and the kingdom of norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the internal security fund for the period 2014 to 2020. proposed act: council decision. role of the european parliament: council may adopt the act only if parliament has given its consent to the act. background: regulation (eu) no 515/2014 of the european parliament and of the council establishing, as part of the internal security fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa became applicable as of 1 january 2014. furthermore, regulation (eu) no 514/2014 of the european parliament and of the council laying down general provisions on the asylum, migration and integration fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management also became applicable on the same date. under this regulation, the provisions of the regulation (eu) no 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the internal security fund (the isf-borders and visa). the purpose of the isf-borders and visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same european rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. the isf-borders and visa will serve to accomplish a key objective of the schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an 'efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders'. it is thus a development of the schengen acquis. article 5(7) of regulation (eu) no 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the union's financial interests and the power of audit of the court of auditors, as the respective association agreements do not provide for such rules. the aim of the draft agreement with norway is to establish the arrangements of this participation and to enable the commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the union budget in respect of this instrument. content: under this proposal, it is proposed that the council adopt the decision in which it is called upon to conclude, on behalf of the european union, the agreement between the european union and the kingdom of norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the internal security fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. rules for the participation of norway in the isf-borders and visas: the agreement provides for a number of technical provisions to establish the framework for participation. the funds allocated to norway under the isf-borders and visa shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management. protection of the financial interests of the union against fraud is also stressed. budgetary control: provisions are laid down as regards budgetary and financial controls. member states shall be subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the court of auditors and of the european anti-fraud office (olaf)) derived either directly from the treaty or from secondary union legislation. moreover, the court of auditors and olaf shall be granted suitable access to carry out controls. financial contributions from norway to the isf: provisions are also provided to guarantee the payments of the contribution from norway to the isf for the implementation of eu actions and its mid-term review and other specific actions. for the years 2016 to 2018, norway shall make annual payments to the budget of the isf-borders and visa in the order of eur 19 777 712. territorial application:

to add albania and bosnia and herzegovina to annex ii, part i of regulation (ec) no 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of member states and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. legal base: article 77(2)(a) of the treaty on the functioning of the eu. background: council regulation (ec) no 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the positive list). the determination of those third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating inter alia to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the eu’s external relations with third countries. consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. in view of the criteria of public order and illegal immigration, particular attention should be paid also to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries concerned. as the criteria set out in regulation (ec) no 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed when appropriate. regulation (ec) no 539/2001 has been amended most recently with regard to the outcome of the visa liberalisation dialogues by transferring the former yugoslav republic of macedonia, montenegro and serbia to the positive list. in a joint declaration adopted in november 2009, the european parliament and the council underlined their political support for a quick abolition of the visa regime for the citizens of these two countries and urged the authorities of albania and bosnia and herzegovina to intensify efforts to comply with all the benchmarks set out in the commission's roadmaps. in addition, the european parliament and the council invited the commission to present a legislative proposal for amending the regulation (ec) no 539/2001 as soon as it had assessed that each country meets the benchmarks of the roadmaps, and took the commitment to examine the commission proposal as a matter of urgency. in april 2010, the commission presented to the european parliament and the council its assessment of the progress made by these two countries in the implementation of the remaining open benchmarks of the roadmaps towards visa liberalisation. the assessment reports concluded that albania and bosnia and herzegovina made important progress and only a very limited number of benchmarks remain open. impact assessment: none content: in proposing this amendment to regulation (ec) no 539/2001 as last amended by regulation (ec) no 1244/2009, the commission is pursuing the objective of adjusting the annexes to the regulation, taking into consideration the progress made in the visa liberalisation dialogues with albania and bosnia and herzegovina during the last seven months and transferring these two countries from annex i (the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of member states) to the annex ii (the list of those third countries whose nationals are exempt from that requirement) of the regulation. this transfer is in line with the political commitment taken by the eu on the liberalisation of the short-stay visa requirement for all western balkan citizens as part of the thessaloniki agenda. considering the introduction of biometric passports by the western balkan countries as an element of fundamental importance for the successful completion of the regional visa liberalisation process and as in regulation (ec) no 1244/2009, the proposal, for reasons relating to security and prevention of illegal migration, limits the visa waiver for the citizens of albania and bosnia and herzegovina to those persons holding the new biometric passports issued by these countries. in parallel with the examination of its proposal in the european parliament and the council, the commission will continue to assess the implementation of the open benchmarks for albania and bosnia and herzegovina and it will share its assessment in a timely manner with the european parliament and the council. for albania, the remaining open benchmarks relate to: the development of a strategy and policy to support the reintegration of albanian returnees

to conclude an agreement between the european union and australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (pnr) data by air carriers to the australian customs and border protection service. proposed act: council decision. background: australian legislation empowers the australian customs service to require each air carrier operating passenger flight to and from australia to provide it with electronic access to passenger name record (pnr) data prior to the passenger arriving or leaving australia. the requirements of the australian authorities are based on the customs act 1901, the customs administration act 1985, the migration act 1958, the crimes act 1914, the privacy act 1988 and the freedom of information act 1982. this legislation aims at obtaining pnr data electronically in advance of a flight's arrival and therefore significantly enhances the australian customs service’s ability to conduct efficient and effective advance risk assessment of passenger and to facilitate bona fide travel, thereby enhancing the security of australia. the european union in cooperating with australia in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime views the transfer of data to australia as fostering international police and judicial cooperation which will be achieved though the transfer of analytical information flowing from pnr data by australia to the competent member states authorities as well as europol and eurojust within their respective competences. the european union signed an agreement in 2008 with australia on the transfer and processing of pnr data based on a set of commitments by the australian customs service in relation to the application of its pnr programme. following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty and pending the conclusion of the agreement, the council sent the 2008 australia agreement to the european parliament for its consent for the conclusion. the european parliament adopted a resolution in which it decided to postpone its vote on the requested consent and requesting a renegotiation of the agreement on the basis of certain criteria (see rsp/2010/2657 ). pending such renegotiation, the 2008 agreement would remain provisionally applicable. on 23 september 2010, the council received three recommendations from the commission to authorise the opening of negotiations for an agreement between the european union and australia for the transfer and use of passenger name record (pnr) data to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational crime. on 11 november 2010, the european parliament adopted a resolution on the recommendation from the commission to the council to authorise the opening of the negotiations. on 2 december 2010, the council adopted a decision, together with a negotiation directive, authorising the commission to open negotiations on behalf of the european union. it is now proposed to conclude the agreement. impact assessment: no impact assessment was undertaken. legal basis: articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a), in conjunction with article 218 (6)(a) of the tfeu. content: the proposal aims to conclude the agreement between the european union and australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (pnr) data by air carriers to the australian customs and border protection service. pnr and basic principles of the agreement : to recall, pnr is a record of each passenger' travel requirements which contains all information necessary to enable reservations to be processed and controlled by air carriers.air carriers are under an obligation to provide the australian customs service with access to certain pnr data to the extent it is collected and contained in the air carrier's automated reservation and departure control systems. however, the data protection laws of the eu do not allow european and other carriers operating flight from the eu to transmit the pnr data of their passengers to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data without adducing appropriate safeguards. accordingly, a solution is required that will provide the legal basis for the transfer of pnr data from the eu to australia as a recognition of the necessity and importance of the use of pnr data in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime, whilst avoiding legal uncertainty for air carriers. in addition, this solution should be applied homogenously throughout the european union in order to ensure a legal certainty for air carriers and respect of individuals' rights to the protection of personal data as well as their physical security. safeguards: the agreement has secured several important safeguards for those whose data will be transferred and processed. in particular, the purpose of processing of pnr data is strictly limited to preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious transnational crime. individuals are provided with the right to access, correction, redress and information. the data will be transferred using exclusively the 'push' method and the use of sensitive data is prohibited. retention period: the retention period of the pnr data is limited and the data will be depersonalised after a certain period. compliance: compliance with these rules shall be subject to independent oversight by the australian information commissioner. fundamental rights: the agreement respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the charter of fundamental rights of the european union, notably the right to private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, and the right to effective remedy and fair trial. the united kingdom and ireland take part in the adoption of the decision. budgetary implications: the proposal has no implications for the eu budget.

to establish the european year of citizens (2013). proposed act: decision of the european parliament and of the council. background: in 2009, an estimated 11.9 million union citizens were living in another member state than their own and many more might exercise this right at some point in their lives: a eurobarometer survey conducted in 2009 showed that more than one third (35%) of european citizens would consider working in another member state. however, close to one in five europeans see too many obstacles to working in another member state. lack of information is (together with language difficulties) is the most important barrier to cross-border commuting, which constitutes, besides trans-national migration, the main form of geographic labour mobility within the eu. recent surveys have also shown that the information citizens need in order to exercise their right to free movement is not strictly limited to the conditions for using this right as such: amongst the administrative issues which people had looked at prior to moving to another member state, the two items mentioned most often were social security and welfare and the recognition of academic diplomas. it is clear that citizens who wish to study, work, retire, live in another member state need to be adequately informed about the different rights available to them in cross-border situations and to be able to effectively enjoy them in practice. without this knowledge citizens are not able to make informed decisions about making use of their free movement rights. more broadly, citizens' awareness of their rights to free movement and more generally of their rights as union citizens is crucial to enable individuals, businesses and society as a whole to benefit from the full range of opportunities available in the single market. the significant gaps in citizens' awareness of their rights were demonstrated by a 2010 eurobarometer survey which showed that, although europeans are broadly aware of their status as union citizens (79% claim some familiarity with the term 'citizen of the european union'), they lack concrete knowledge about the exact meaning of rights attached to this status. more specifically, only 43% know the meaning of the term 'citizen of the european union' and almost half of european citizens (48%) indicate that they are not well informed about their rights. in the eu citizenship report 2010""dismantling the obstacles to eu citizens' rights"", the commission identified main obstacles which citizens still encounter in their daily lives when they seek to exercise their rights as union citizens and outlined 25 concrete actions to remove these obstacles. in the context of this exercise, the commission concluded that union citizens are prevented from enjoying their rights because they lack awareness of them and announced its intention to step up the dissemination of information to union citizens about their rights as such and in particular about their free movement rights. the designation of 2013 as the european year of citizens, leading to the organisation of targeted events on eu citizenship and citizen-related eu policies during this year, is thus listed in the eu citizenship report 2010 as one of the actions to implement in order to remedy this lack of awareness. impact assessment: an ex-ante evaluation was carried out, which indicated amongst other matters, that the actions to be implemented in the proposed european year do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. the proposal respects therefore the principle of proportionality. legal basis: article 21(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the eu (tfeu). although member states retain the primary responsibility for raising citizens' awareness of their rights as union citizens, adequate actions to address this problem require multilateral partnerships, transnational exchanges of information and experience and union-wide awareness-raising and dissemination of good practices. therefore, the objectives of the proposed european year can be better achieved at union level. content: the year 2013 shall be designated as the european year of citizens. the overall purpose of the proposed european year of citizens is to ensure that all union citizens are aware of the rights available to them in a cross-border context by virtue of their union citizenship status, so as to enable them to make informed decisions about whether to make use of their right to free movement and to facilitate the effective exercise of this right. the european year will aim, more specifically, at: raising union citizens' awareness of their right to move and reside freely within the european union and more generally the rights guaranteed to union citizens in cross-border situations, including their right to participate in the democratic life of the union"

established the european fund for the integration of third-country nationals , as part of the general programme ‘solidarity and management of migration flows’. these funds provide for different union

marked deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several member states. some member states are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, particularly with respect to their financial and economic stability, leading to deterioration in their deficit and debt positions and threatening economic growth heightened by the international economic and financial environment. ensuring the smooth implementation of programmes adopted under the four funds established as part of the general programme on ‘solidarity and management of migration flows’ (‘the funds’), is of particular importance as a means of injecting funds into the economy. to make european union funding easier to manage in the area of migration, asylum and external borders and to improve the availability of funding for the member states to implement their annual programmes under the funds, it is necessary, on a temporary basis and without prejudice to the 2014-2020 programming period, to arrange for an increase in the union co-financing rate under the funds, by an amount corresponding to twenty percentage points above the co-financing rates currently applicable, for member states experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability. it should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal regarding a similar amendment of the external borders fund (please see cod/2012/0253 ). legal basis: articles 78(2) and article 79(2) and (4) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). impact assessment: there was no consultation of external stakeholders. the proposal will allow the commission to apply higher co-financing rates for the countries benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. content: in order to ensure that member states benefiting from a financial support mechanism continue to implement the programmes adopted under the funds on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the proposal contains provisions that would allow the commission to increase the union co-financing rate for these countries, for the period during which they benefit from financial assistance provided by one of the support mechanisms under any funding instruments. this will provide additional financial resources to the member states and will make it easier to continue implementing the programmes on the ground. the funds’ annual national allocation pursuant to the basic acts will remain unchanged while national co-financing will be reduced accordingly. ongoing annual programmes will need to be revised to reflect the changes resulting from the application of the increased union co-financing rate. the proposal makes provision for the following amendments: amendment of article 14 and article 21(3) of decision no 573/2007/ec: article 14 currently provides that the union co-financing rate for supported actions does not in principle exceed 50% (and that this union co-financing rate may be increased to 75% if the member state in question is covered by the cohesion fund). under this proposal, it is proposed that the union contribution could to be increased by 20 percentage points, if the member state satisfies one of the following conditions at the time at which they submit their draft annual programme: i) article 21(3) of decision no 573/2007/ec provides that financial assistance from the european refugee fund for emergency measures shall not exceed 80% of the cost of each measure. the commission proposes to allow the union co-financing rate applicable to the european refugee fund programmes of the member states concerned to be increased by 20 percentage points, provided they are benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. amendment of article 15 of decision no 575/2007/ec establishing the european return fund and amendment of article 13 of council decision 2007/435/ec establishing the european fund for the integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007 to 2013 have identical content to article 14 of decision no 573/2007/ec. the proposal contains a similar provision increasing the union co-financing rate by 20 percentage points. annual programme : once a decision granting financial assistance to a member state under one of the support mechanisms has been taken, the member state may submit to the commission either a draft annual programme or a draft revised annual programme applying the increased union co-financing rate. however, once an action of a specific annual programme has been co-financed at the increased union co-financing rate, it remains so until the end of the eligibility period of the related annual programme whether or not the member state still benefits from one of the support mechanisms. budgetary implications: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modifications are proposed to the maximum amounts of the funds' financing provided for in the annual programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. the proposal states that it shows the commission's willingness to assist member states in their efforts to deal with the financial crisis. the amendments will provide the member states concerned with the necessary funds to support projects and economic recovery.

to lay down the general provisions on the asylum and migration fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management., in the framework of the horizontal regulation for implementation. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: home affairs policies have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. these policies are at the heart of the european project to create an area without internal borders where eu citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. the commission adopted a proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: a budget for delivering the europe 2020 strategy. the commission proposed to simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to a two-fund structure: an asylum and migration fund and an internal security fund. experience suggests that in the current programming period, the diversity and fragmentation of rules governing spending programmes are often perceived as unnecessarily complicated and difficult to implement and control. this imposes a heavy administrative burden on beneficiaries as well as on the commission and member states, which can have the unintended effect of discouraging participation, increasing error rates and delaying implementation. this means that the potential benefits of union programmes are not fully realised. this regulation is part of a package of four regulations, jointly establishing the framework for union funding on home affairs under the two funds. this regulation lays down rules on programming, management and control, financial management, clearance of accounts, closure of programmes and reporting and evaluation. thus, it sets out the delivery mechanisms whereas the purpose and scope of the two funds, the resources and means of implementation are defined in their respective specific regulations. this horizontal instrument will ensure a common approach to the implementation of the two funds and a uniform treatment of beneficiaries in relation to all union support in the area of home affairs. impact assessment: i accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. the impact assessment identified problems in relation to the scope and priorities of the current home affairs spending programmes on the one hand and the problems regarding the delivery of funding on the other hand. in relation to the latter, the impact assessment examined options in relation to shared management, centralised management and the timely response to emergency situations. in relation to shared management , the impact assessment concluded that a multiannual programme preceded by a policy dialogue was the preferred option. contrary to the status quo, which combines annual programmes within a multiannual framework, it would significantly reduce administrative workload. in terms of improving the delivery of funding under centralised management , the status quo was discarded because it offers little or no prospect of simplification or reduction of administrative workload. recourse to a more targeted, less resource-intensive and diversified centralised management is the preferred option because it is expected to improve relations with key stakeholders and to lead to an overall reduction in workload. in relation to the emergency response mechanism , the impact assessment concluded that the current mechanism clearly does not meet the need for a quicker and more effective response to crises in the areas of migration and security. an improved mechanism extended to both a wider range of migration-related crises and security-related crises was considered the preferred option. stakeholders supported the idea of reducing the number of financial instruments to a two-fund structure on the condition that this would actually lead to simplification. they also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism to allow the union to respond quickly and effectively to migration and security-related crises. shared management with a move to multi-annual programming with the definition of common targets at union level was generally seen as the appropriate management method for all home affairs spending although non-governmental organisations were of the view that direct management should also be continued . legal basis: articles 78(2), 79(2), 79(4), 82(1), 84 and 87(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). in light of this legal basis, the provisions of this regulation lay down horizontal common provisions for the implementation of the asylum and migration fund and one component of the internal security fund, namely the instrument for financial support for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management. content: this regulation lays down obligations only of a financial and technical nature and leaves the choices on the definition of policy objectives, eligible actions, the allocation of resources and the scope of the intervention for each specific policy area to the respective legal basis (i.e. in the specific regulations). as a new general framework for implementing union funding in the area of home affairs policies, this regulation sets outs general rules on the financing of expenditure including rules on partnership, programming, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, the management and control systems to be put in place by the member states and the clearance of accounts. general principles : the proposed regulation seeks to lay down the conditions for: a more policy-driven and results-oriented funding, including through reinforced strategic programming

to establish, as part of the internal security fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa. this fund will take over from the external borders fund 2007-2013 which shall be repealed with effect from 1 january 2014. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: the policies related to the area of freedom, security and justice have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. these policies are at the heart of the european project to create an area without internal borders where union citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. in the field of internal security, key documents such as the commission's communication on the internal security strategy have provided clear guidance on the direction of activities in the years to come. for border management and visa policy, the communication on migration outlined in more detail the challenges ahead in relation to border security and the development of an area without internal borders. the communication on the schengen governance presented proposals to strengthen the schengen acquis by means of a governance system capable of responding effectively, and in a timely and coordinated union-wide way, to exceptional circumstances and challenges which might put the overall functioning of schengen at stake. the communication on smart borders – options and the way ahead outlines how new it systems such as an entry/exit system and a registered traveller programme can contribute to a better management of migration flows in the union. a key component in the common integrated border management system has been the development of union solidarity mechanisms, supporting a uniform and high-quality application of the union standards on border management and the common visa policy. enhancing the coordination of operational co-operation by the member states on border control through the frontex agency constitutes an important step towards the development of the system. moreover, with the external borders fund, the union expresses solidarity through financial assistance to those member states that apply the schengen provisions on external borders and visa. it is against this background that the commission, in its proposal on the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020, suggested to set up an internal security fund, as part of a simplified two-fund structure for future expenditure in the home affairs area which also includes the creation of an asylum and migration fund. impact assessment: in accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. work on the preparation of the future financial instruments for home affairs started in 2010 and continued into 2011. it was completed in july 2011 and brought together available evaluation results for the existing financial instruments and informed the problems, objectives and policy options, including their likely impact, examined in the impact assessment. on the basis of this study, the commission drafted an impact assessment report. the main conclusion may be summarised as follows: to broaden the scope of action for union funding in the field of asylum and migration, including as regards its external dimension, to work towards more simplification of delivery mechanisms and greater flexibility, notably to respond to emergencies. in the area of internal security, stakeholders considered that the broad thematic priorities have already been fixed by the 2009 stockholm programme and the 2010 internal security strategy. a future funding mechanism should therefore be defined comprehensively, comprising law enforcement, border guards and customs communities. the need to make greater use of relevant union agencies, such as europol and frontex was also considered important. there was broad support to reduce the number of financial instruments to a two-fund structure on the condition that this leads to simplification. stakeholders also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism. legal basis: article 77 (2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). the creation of the internal security fund requires the adoption of two legislative instruments which jointly constitute the fund. this overall structure was chosen in light of the treaty obligations. it is not legally possible to draw up one single comprehensive legislative proposal for an internal security fund, despite the coherence of the policy objectives to be addressed. the internal security fund is therefore created as a comprehensive financial framework which is composed of two separate acts, setting up the different components of the fund and laying down the objectives, the eligible actions and the envelopes of each component: - a regulation setting up, as part of the fund, the component for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management
