1044,EU-Belarus Agreement on readmission of persons residing without authorisation,"PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Belarus on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit in May 2009, the EU reaffirmed its political support towards full liberalisation of the visa regime in a secure environment, and towards promoting mobility by concluding visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Eastern Partnership countries. According to the common approach for the development of EU policy on visa facilitation agreed at the level of COREPER by the Member States in December 2005, a visa facilitation agreement would not be concluded without a readmission agreement being in place. On that basis, the Commission presented on 12 November 2010, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate Agreements with the Republic of Belarus on, respectively, the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas, and readmission of persons residing without authorisation. Negotiations with Belarus were officially opened in Brussels on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an agreement initialled on 17 June 2019. In the meantime, Belarus, the European Union and seven participating Member States (Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Finland and Latvia) signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership on 13 October 2016. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and Belarus to facilitate the readmission of persons residing without authorisation. The purpose of the Agreement is to establish rapid and effective procedures for the identification and safe and orderly return of persons who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, presence in, or residence on the territory of Belarus or one of the Member States of the European Union, and to facilitate the transit of such persons in a spirit of co-operation. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - an opening clause reaffirming that the agreement must be applied in such a way as to ensure respect for human rights and the obligations and responsibilities of the requested and requesting States under the international instruments applicable to them; - readmission obligations on the basis of full reciprocity, applying to nationals as well as third-country nationals and stateless persons; - obligation to readmit nationals also concerning (i) former nationals who have been deprived of their nationality or who have renounced it without obtaining the nationality of another State; (ii) family members (i.e. spouse and unmarried minor children), whatever their nationality, who do not have an independent right of residence in the requesting State; - obligation to readmit third-country nationals and stateless persons subject to certain preconditions. This obligation does not apply to persons who have only carried out airport transit or who have obtained a visa or residence permit from the requested Member State unless, for example, the person does not comply with one of the conditions attached to the visa; - definition of the technical modalities governing the readmission procedure (readmission application, means of evidence, time limits, transfer modalities and modes of transport). Procedural flexibility is provided by the fact that no readmission application will be needed in cases where the person to be readmitted is in possession of a valid travel document; - description of the agreed accelerated procedure for persons apprehended in an area extending up to 30 kilometres beyond the common land border between a Member State and Belarus, as well as on the territory of the international airports of the Member States and Belarus. - necessary rules on costs, data protection and the position of the agreement in relation to other international obligations. In particular, the proposal for a Decision specifies that the Commission, assisted by experts from the Member States, shall represent the Union in the Joint Readmission Committee established by the Agreement. The specific situation of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is reflected in the preamble, and, regarding Denmark, in a relevant joint declaration."
2830,Application of railway safety and interoperability rules within the Channel tunnel,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive (EU) 2016/798, as regards the application of railway safety in order to deal specifically with the situation of the Channel Fixed Link after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. To ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link, it would be beneficial to retain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single safety authority responsible for the whole of this infrastructure. To this end, it is necessary to adapt Directive (EU) 2016/798. In a parallel and related initiative, the Commission also proposes the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and Council empowering France to negotiate and conclude under certain conditions an international agreement that would maintain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single national safety authority for the Channel Fixed Link. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Article 3(7) of Directive (EU) 2016/798, which defines the concept of ‘national safety authority’ for the purposes of both railway safety under that Directive and railway interoperability under Directive (EU) 2016/797. Specifically, the proposal shall: - allow a body entrusted by a Member State and a third country with the tasks regarding railway safety and interoperability on the basis of an international agreement concluded or authorised by the EU to be considered as a national safety authority under Union law; - provide that, where necessary for reasons of railway safety, the Member State concerned should make use without delay of the right afforded by the agreement with the third country concerned, whereby the national safety authority is entitled to assume sole competence over the part of the rail infrastructure situated in that Member State; - provide that the European Court of Justice would have jurisdiction to give a ruling at the request of an arbitration tribunal set up by an international agreement such as the one that France should be empowered to negotiate and conclude with the United Kingdom."
11385,Rail: prolongation of temporary levying of charges - COVID-19,"PURPOSE: to extend the application of the temporary rules on the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure laid down in response to the urgent situation created by the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp drop in rail traffic, because of a significant fall in demand. This has had a serious impact on railway undertakings. Those circumstances are beyond the control of railway undertakings that have continuously faced considerable liquidity problems, major losses and in some cases are risking insolvency. In order to counteract the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and support railway undertakings, Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 of the European Parliament and of the Council enabled Member States to authorise infrastructure managers to reduce, waive or defer charges for accessing rail infrastructure. That possibility was granted for a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020 and was further extended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1061 until 31 December 2021. The Commission is no longer empowered to extend further that reference period. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing therefore the reference period of Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 should be extended until 30 June 2022 to ensure continuity in the application of the measures. CONTENT: the Commission proposal aims to extend the reference period until 30 June 2022, and to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts to further extend such period until 31 December 2023. It is also proposed that the delegation of power should end on the same date, that is, 31 December 2023. All other provisions of the current Regulation should remain unchanged. The Commission should continuously analyse the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the rail sector and the Union should be in a position to prolong without undue delay the period of application of the measures provided for by this Regulation if the adverse conditions persist. In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, it should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."
1016,Temporary measures concerning the validity of certificates and licences (omnibus),"PURPOSE: to extend the time limits laid down in Union law for the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations, and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in certain areas of transport legislation in the context of COVID 19. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that affect normal activity of the competent authorities in the Member States and the work of transport undertakings as regards the administrative formalities to be completed in different transport sectors that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of the relevant measures. Those extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on various areas covered by Union transport law. In particular, transport operators and other persons concerned may not be able to complete the necessary formalities or procedures to comply with certain provisions of Union law related to the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations or to complete other steps necessary to maintain their validity. This is the case, for instance, with driving licences, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers, Community licences and driver attestations for the provisions of road haulage services, rail single safety certificates or authorisations, boatmasters’ certificates or port security assessments etc. It is most likely that those certificates, licences, authorisations which, in accordance with Union law, would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 could not be renewed in due time. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt temporary provisions extending the validity of those certificates, licences or authorisations that would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and ensure that they remain valid during a reasonable period of time during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down specific and temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in response to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the area of road, rail and inland waterways transport and maritime security. This proposal concerns specific provisions that affect the application of several Directives and Regulations:  Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which (lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses with the objective to ensure safety on European roads). Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (provides for the mutual recognition of the driving licences issued by Member States based on a Union model driving licence). Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (defines the harmonised minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness testing). Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator). Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lay down common rules for access to the international road haulage market and the international market for coach and bus services, respectively). Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/798 (regulate safety certification and authorisation in the Union). Directive 2007/59/EC of the European Parliament (lays down rules on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union). Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (establishes a single European railway area). Directive 96/50/EC (lays down conditions for obtaining boatmasters’ certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union). Directive (EU) 2016/1629 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels). Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down rules on ship and port facility security). Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down measures to enhance port security in the face of threats of security incidents). This Regulation should be adopted as a matter of urgency, so that situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors, in particular where the relevant time limits have already expired, remain as short as possible."
12525,Gas storage,"PURPOSE: to lay down safeguard measures concerning the security of gas supply with new obligations for Member States on gas storage and access to natural gas transmissions. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is faced with potential threats to the security of gas supply, mainly linked to its dependence for primary energy from third countries. The escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine since February 2022 has led to unprecedented price increases. These price increases are likely to fundamentally change the incentives to fill storage facilities in the Union. In the current geopolitical context, further supply disruptions of gas can no longer be excluded. This could severely harm citizens and the economy of the Union, as the Union is still to a significant extent dependent on external gas supplies which can be affected by the conflict. It is therefore crucial that the EU acts in a coordinated manner to avoid potential risks resulting from a possible gas supply interruption. CONTENT: this proposal amends two existing regulations, Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and Regulation (EU) 715/2009 on conditions for access to natural gas transmission networks. It builds on the existing framework for gas security of supply and internal gas market rules, adding further measures needed to ensure security of supply of natural gas in the Union in the context of the severe energy crisis caused by recent changes of the geopolitical situation. The proposal aims notably at ensuring that storage capacities in the Union, which are crucial to ensure security of supply, do not remain unused, to ensure that storages can be shared across the Union, in a spirit of solidarity. Mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities The proposal seeks to ensure that a mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities will reinforce the security of supply ahead of the winter 2022/2023 and for the following winter periods. A new provision will require the Member States to ensure that the storage infrastructures in its territory are, in principle, filled up to at least 90% of their capacity at Member State level by 1 November each year, with intermediary targets for each Member State in February, May, July, and September. For 2022, the filling target is set at 80% of the capacity of all storage facilities located on the territory of the respective Member States. The Commission is mandated to ensure that the filling targets are met in case intermediate targets are missed. Certification of storage system operators A new mandatory certification of all storage system operators will avoid potential risks resulting from outside influence over critical storage infrastructure, meaning that non-certified operators will have to give up ownership or control of EU gas storage facilities. In addition, for a gas storage facility to close down its operations it would need to have an authorisation from the national regulator. Burden sharing mechanism The proposal introduced a burden sharing mechanism, as although not all Member States have storage facilities in their territories, all will benefit from having a guaranteed high filling level, in terms of the insurance value against security of supply risks and price dampening effects in winter. New filling obligations Competent authorities will continuously monitor the filling of the underground storage facilities in order to ensure that their national filling trajectories are met. This new provision also reinforces the role of the Gas Coordination Group, giving it an explicit mandate to monitor Member States' performance in the area of gas security of supply, and to develop best practices on that basis. Tariff rebate In order to incentivise the refilling of EU gas storage facilities, the Commission is proposing a 100% discount on capacity-based transmission tariffs at entry and exit points of storage facilities."
466,CAP: Financial discipline as from financial year 2021 and flexibility between pillars in respect of calendar year 2020,"PURPOSE: to ensure certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers in the year 2020 and ensuring the respect of budgetary ceilings for the EAGF by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in relation to the financing of the CAP, certain amendments of Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Horizontal Regulation) are needed to ensure that the financial discipline mechanism that makes it possible to respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation on the multi-annual financial framework can still operate for financial years post 2020. In relation to Direct Payments, Regulation (EU) 2019/288 amended Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy (Direct Payments Regulation) to extend the flexibility between pillars foreseen for calendar years 2015-2019 to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. This regulation sets up the amounts to transfer from the rural development to direct payments envelope as a percentage of the amount allocated to support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021 by Union legislation adopted after the adoption by the Council of the relevant Regulation pursuant to Article 312(2) TFEU. The relevant Union legislation may not be in place by the time the Member States need to notify their decision to transfer. To make it possible to apply the flexibility from rural development to direct payments, it is appropriate to establish the maximum amount that can be transferred based on a fixed amount and not a percentage. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulations (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council aims to ensure the continuity of certain elements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a transitional period of one year from 2014-2020 until the rules on CAP strategic plans are applied, in line with the Commission's proposal on support for CAP strategic plans. Update of the reference for determining a financial discipline rate Expenditure under the EAGF within a given financial year shall respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For that purpose, the said Regulation provides for the determination of a financial discipline adjustment rate. However, currently the relevant provisions refer to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 which only sets the relevant ceilings for the period 2014-2020. To ensure that the ceiling for the financing of market related expenditure and direct payments post 2020 will also be respected, the legal reference of Articles 16 and 26 should be amended to include the regulation to be adopted by the Council for financial year 2021 onwards. Change of the basis for notifying the transfer from rural development to direct payments To ensure continuity in the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between the two pillars, already decided by the colegislators in Regulation (EU) 2019/288, the Commission proposed to replace the percentage of transfer by maximum absolute amounts based on the current maximum percentages. Member States had the possibility to review by 1 August 2019 the percentage of their national ceiling for direct payments, which they want to allocate to Voluntary Coupled Support (VCS), as well as their detailed support decisions (i.e. list of support measures and their envelopes, targeting, etc.). This review, if any, will apply from claim year 2020. In addition, Member States will have to notify only by 31 December 2019 or shortly thereafter their transfers between pillars affecting their national ceiling for direct payments for calendar year 2020. Budgetary implications The amounts included in the transitional proposal are in line with amounts proposed for the CAP under Heading 3 in the proposal covering the Multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. For market-related expenditure financed by the EAGF, allocations under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be adjusted to the level which were proposed for the same sectors in the proposal on support for the CAP strategic plans, for financial year 2021. The amendments of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 ensure that a financial discipline adjustment rate can be determined in financial years 2021 and onwards where the expenditure forecasts for the measures financed under the EAGF net ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings would be exceeded. Thereby, the amendment potentially decreases expenditure under EAGF to the maximum level agreed for the fund in the multiannual financial framework. The amendment of the flexibility provision for calendar year 2020 (financial year 2021) is a technical adjustment to ensure applicability of the provision and does not have any financial implications compared to those intended for the existing provision. The review option for the voluntary coupled support may lead to financial reallocations between measures within the Member States but these will remain within the national ceiling and as such do not require additional financing."
8729,ETIAS consequential amendments: police and judicial cooperation,
5152,Elimination of customs duties on certain products,"PURPOSE: to eliminate customs duties on certain imports into the European Union with a view to consolidating the partnership between the European Union and the United States. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the US have a close trade and investment relationship. Bilateral trade in goods and services between them amounts to more than EUR 1000 billion per year, or EUR 3 billion per day. On 21 August 2020 Commissioner Hogan and US Trade Representative Lighthizer stated their intention to go ahead with a trade-facilitating package to eliminate or reduce customs duties for a small number of tariff lines covering EUR 168 million (approximatively USD 200 million) in EU and US exports. The Commission therefore proposes to create additional opportunities for EU and US operators by eliminating or reducing tariffs. It sees this initiative as a first step to de-escalate bilateral trade tensions and to support the settlement of on-going disputes. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to eliminate a number of customs tariffs on lobster. Lobster is not sensitive products for the EU, which is a net importer of these products. EU producers supply less than 5% of European consumption. The elimination of import duties shall support the food-processing industry and the hospitality sector. In return, the US has committed to ease market access for EU27 exports worth EUR 143 million (USD 160 million) on average in the past three years, through a 50% reduction of duties. These include products such as prepared meals, certain crystal glassware, surface preparations, propellant powders, cigarette lighters and lighter parts. The US requested the tariff reduction for lobster in light of its declining exports of the product to Europe and the world. The tariff reductions should be implemented in a fully WTO consistent manner and respect the most-favoured nation (MFN) principle. The measures shall apply retroactively as of 1 August 2020 and end on 31 July 2025. The agreement shall have a limited negative impact on the budget of the EU in the form of foregone customs duties due to tariff liberalisation for the products covered by the tariff lines in annex to this Regulation, representing some EUR 5.3 million in duties collected from the US (average 2017-2019 period)."
7431,Strategic Innovation Agenda of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology,"PURPOSE: to propose a new strategic innovation programme for the European Institute of Innovation and Technology for the period 2021 to 2027. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Institute of Innovation and Technology was established in 2008 by Regulation (EC) No 294/2008, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2013. Its overall mission is to stimulate sustainable European economic growth and competitiveness by strengthening the innovative capacity of Member States and the Union. The EIT achieves these objectives mainly through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together more than 1 200 partners from business, research and education. The EIT is an integral part of the Commission's proposal for the Horizon Europe Programme (2021-2027), and more particularly the Open Innovation pillar of this programme, but it has a separate legal basis (the EIT Regulation). This initiative aims to make the EIT Regulation compatible with Horizon Europe and to improve the functioning of the EIT, taking into account the lessons learned in recent years. It also aims to propose a new Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIP) setting out the EIT's strategy and priorities for the period 2021-2027, as well as its objectives, key actions, expected results and resource requirements. For the period 2021-2027, the SIA should ensure consistency with Horizon Europe's objectives and the programme's requirements for multiannual strategic planning, monitoring and other activities, and promote synergies with other relevant programmes. This proposal for a new EIT SIA for the period 2021-2027 is therefore presented in parallel to the proposal to recast the EIT Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the chosen option is based on the baseline scenario (continuation of the EIT's activities in their current form, with the necessary adjustments to bring the EIT into line with the Horizon Europe proposal). In addition, it adopts a number of technical measures to enhance the functioning of the EIT and proposes a new action to foster entrepreneurial education across Europe. CONTENT: the proposed EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA) for the period 2021-2027 defines the EIT's priority areas, strategy and financial needs for this period and sets out how the EIT will contribute to the achievement of Horizon Europe's objectives. Main improvements The SIA clarifies the role of the EIT in the Horizon Europe programme and sets out its complementarity to the various parts of Horizon Europe, notably also the European Innovation Council. It includes a number of improvements to the existing EIT model. They concern: (i) the alignment with the European partnerships under Horizon Europe and their governing rules, (ii) the improvement of the current funding model as recommended by the European Court of Auditors and, (iii) the inclusion of the possibility for the EIT to conclude memoranda of cooperation with KICs to keep former KICs as active members of the EIT Community after the termination of their framework partnership agreement. Clear monitoring and evaluation provisions are defined taking into account the Horizon Europe framework and the EIT’s specificities. Support to KICs The EIT will consolidate the eight existing KICs, fostering their growth and impact, and accompany their transition to financial sustainability. In particular, this will concern the first wave of three KICs launched in 2009 (EIT Climate, EIT Digital and EIT InnoEnergy) whose framework partnership agreements will terminate after 2024. The EIT will also launch two new KICs in specific thematic areas in order to tackle future emerging global societal challenges and needs. The SIA identifies Cultural and Creative Industries as a priority field for a new KIC with a call to be launched in 2021. A second call for a new KIC is foreseen in 2024 to add new priority fields. EIT-coordinated activities The EIT will support 750 higher education institutions through funding, expertise and mentoring, enabling them to develop economic activities in their field of interest and to better integrate into local innovation ecosystems. The EIT Label will be part of the EIT's reinforced focus on education. The EIT will put a strong emphasis on cross-cutting actions such as communication, identification, codification and dissemination of good practices, and international cooperation. Another key area of action for the EIT will be the expansion and strengthening of its regional outreach through the Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS). RIS will offer in particular opportunities to Member States with low innovation performance and enhance their access to the EIT KICs. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 3 billion for the period 2021-2027. The impact on administrative appropriations is estimated at EUR 75 million."
12506,Data Governance Act,"PURPOSE: to promote the availability of data for use, by proposing measures to stimulate data sharing and to support the European Data Spaces. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal for a Regulation on European Data Governance (Data Governance Act) is the first concrete action in the framework of the European Data Strategy. In its Data Strategy, the Commission described the vision of a common European data space, a Single Market for data in which data could be used irrespective of its physical location of storage in the EU in compliance with applicable law. It also called for the free and safe flow of data with third countries, subject to exceptions and restrictions for public security, public order and other legitimate public policy objectives of the European Union. The Commission proposed to establish domain specific common European data spaces, as the concrete arrangements in which data sharing and data pooling can happen. Such common European data spaces can cover areas such as health, mobility, manufacturing, financial services, energy, or agriculture or thematic areas, such as the European green deal or European data spaces for public administration or skills. In this context, it is necessary to improve the conditions for data sharing in the internal market, by creating a harmonised framework for data exchanges. A single market for data should ensure that data from the public sector, businesses and citizens can be accessed and used in the most effective and responsible manner possible, while businesses and citizens keep control of the data they generate and the investments made into their collection are safeguarded. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the impact assessment support study, while in the baseline scenario the data economy and the economic value of data sharing is expected to increase to an estimated EUR 510-533 billion (3.87% of GDP), this would rise to EUR 540.7-544.4 billion (3.92%-3.95% of GDP) depending on the preferred option. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to promote the availability of data for use, by increasing trust in data intermediaries and strengthening data sharing mechanisms across the EU. Re-use of certain data held by the public sector The proposal creates a mechanism to enhance the use of certain public sector data, conditional on the respect of the rights of others (notably on grounds of protection of personal data, but also protection of intellectual property rights and commercial confidentiality). Public sector bodies authorising such re-use should be technically equipped to ensure that data protection, privacy and confidentiality are fully preserved. The proposal: - defines a set of harmonised basic conditions, the respect of which would allow the re-use of data (e.g. the non-exclusivity requirement); - obliges Member States to set up (i) a single contact point to help researchers and innovative companies select identify suitable data, and (ii) structures that will support public sector bodies with technical means and legal assistance. Creation of a notification regime for data sharing service providers In order to increase trust in the sharing of personal and non-personal data and lower transaction costs to B2B and C2B data sharing by creating a notification regime for data sharing providers, providers of data-sharing services would have to comply with a number of requirements, including the obligation to remain neutral with regard to the data exchanged and not to use such data for other purposes. A competent authority designated by the Member States would be responsible for monitoring compliance with the requirements relating to the provision of data sharing services. Data Altruism In order to facilitate altruistic data (data voluntarily made available by individuals or companies for the common good), the proposal gives data altruistic organisations the possibility to register as a ‘Data Altruism Organisation recognised in the EU’ in order to increase trust in their operations. Governance The proposal: - sets out the requirements for the functioning of the competent authorities designated to monitor and implement the notification framework for data-sharing service providers and entities engaged in data altruism. It also contains provisions on the right to lodge complaints against the decisions of such bodies and on the means of judicial redress; - creates a formal expert group (the ‘European Data Innovation Board’), which will facilitate the emergence of best practice by Member State authorities and advise the Commission on the governance of cross-sectoral standardisation."
