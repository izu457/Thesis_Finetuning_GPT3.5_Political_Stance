2724,Regulation establishing measures for a sustainable rail market in view of the COVID-19 pandemic,"PURPOSE: to assist the railway sector deal with the emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant drop in demand which in turn has led to a sharp drop in rail transport. Demand for both passenger and freight services for the whole of 2020 is expected to be well below 2019 levels. The pandemic may lead to a large number of insolvencies and liquidity shortages within the railway sector. It affects all the supply chain and has effects on railway undertakings, shippers and logistic enterprises. Infrastructure managers and service facility operators will also suffer from its financial consequences. The rail sector makes a vital contribution to the European economy as a whole and to employment, directly employing more than 1 million people, of whom around 600 000 are employed in railway undertakings and 440 000 in infrastructure managers (by the end of 2016). Rail transport is also a key element of the EU's strategy to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, ensure economic and social cohesion and connecting Europeans within and between Member States. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a Single European Railway Area does not allow Member States, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, to respond to the unpredictable effects on rail transport by adapting, in particular, the rules on charging and capacity allocation. Targeted derogations should therefore be allowed in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on rail transport and to preserve the integrity of the single European railway area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation is intended to complete the existing rail-related framework in order to allow national authorities and rail stakeholders to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the urgent needs of the railway sector as long as those consequences persist. These temporary emergency measures concern notably the waiver, reduction or deferral of track access charges for the use of rail infrastructure, as well as the waiver of reservation charges. They cover a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, in respect of which charges may be altered, by derogation from Article 27 of Directive 2012/34/EU whereby the network statement (displaying all applicable charges) shall be published no less than for months in advance for the deadline for requests for infrastructure capacity. Income losses on the part of infrastructure managers as a result of the reductions envisaged in the proposed Regulation shall be reimbursed by Member States by 31 December of the year following the year in which the loss was incurred at the latest. The Commission may, by means of delegated acts, extend the time period during which the measures envisaged by the proposed Regulation apply.",1.016,0.956,0.905,0.822,0.579,0.935,0.916,0.951,1,0,0,0
10910,Union tariff rate quota for high quality beef from Paraguay,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards Union tariff rate quota for high quality beef from Paraguay. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the Union and the UK notified the other Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that their current market access level will be maintained but apportioned respectively between the Union and the United Kingdom. The methodology for this apportionment, as well as the new EU-27 volumes, are laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Paraguay has a tariff rate quota of 1 000 tonnes for high quality bovine meat (order number 094455), which is not included in the EU’s WTO schedule. This tariff rate quotas was erroneously included in the apportionment exercise and thus reduced to 711 tonnes on the EU-27 side without any corresponding volume being opened on the UK side. This means Paraguay’s market access has been reduced from 1 000 tonnes to 711 tonnes with application as of 1 January 2021. It is therefore appropriate to restore this tariff quota to its original volume. This initiative is in line with the EU’s ongoing actions to ensure that the consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU are dealt with in an orderly manner. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/216 in order to restore the correct volume (1000 tonnes) of tariff quota No 094455 for EU-27. The row relating to order number 094455 (High quality meat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen from Paraguay) would thus be deleted from the Annex, Part A of Regulation (EU) 2019/216.",1.032,0.945,0.014,0.849,0.544,0.926,0.851,0.024,1,0,0,0
1040,EU-Montenegro status agreement on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Montenegro,"The European Parliament adopted by 568 votes to 109, with 11 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Status Agreement between the European Union and Montenegro on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Montenegro. Following the recommendation of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement. The proposed Council Decision aims to approve the Status Agreement between the European Union and Montenegro on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Montenegro as foreseen in the Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 on the European Border and Coast Guard. Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 explicitly provides that, in cases where it is envisaged that European Border and Coast Guard teams will be deployed to a third country, in actions where the team members will have executive powers, or where other actions in third countries require it, a status agreement shall be concluded by the Union with the third country concerned. The purpose of the Status Agreement is to provide a legally binding framework that should set out the scope of the operation, the rules on civil and criminal liability, and the tasks and powers of the deployed members of the teams. The status agreements should also guarantee the full respect of fundamental rights and should establish dedicated complaints mechanisms to be used in case of fundamental rights violations during these operations. The Status Agreement with Montenegro is one of several similar agreements concluded with the Western Balkan countries. It would allow for joint operations, rapid border interventions and/or return operations to take place on the territory of Montenegro with the involvement of the Agency. The return operations would relate solely to third country nationals being returned from the European Union to Montenegro.",0.984,0.956,0.068,0.822,0.509,0.935,0.89,0.024,1,0,0,0
12871,Distortive foreign subsidies,"PURPOSE: to propose a new instrument to address the potentially distorting effects of foreign subsidies in the single market. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a strong, open and competitive single market allows both European and foreign companies to compete on the basis of merit, provided that a level playing field in the market is guaranteed. In recent years, there have been cases where foreign subsidies have been found to have distorting effects on the EU's internal market, creating an uneven playing field. These foreign subsidies can take different forms, such as zero interest loans, unlimited state guarantees, tax exemptions or reductions for foreign investment or trade, or dedicated State funding. EU rules on competition, public procurement and trade defence instruments play an important role in ensuring a level playing field for companies operating in the single market. However, none of these tools apply to foreign subsidies that give their beneficiaries an unfair advantage when acquiring EU companies, participating in public procurement in the EU or doing other business in the EU. There are currently no specific EU rules to address the distorting effects that foreign subsidies can have on the internal market. It is therefore necessary to complement the existing EU instruments with a new instrument to effectively combat distortions in the internal market caused by foreign subsidies and to ensure a level playing field The legislative proposal aims to fill a regulatory gap in the Single Market. It is in line with the new Industrial Strategy for Europe presented by the Commission in March 2020 and follows the adoption of the White Paper on foreign subsidies in June 2020. CONTENT: the proposed regulation establishes rules and procedures for investigating foreign subsidies that distort the internal market and for remedying the distortions they cause. Such distortions may affect all economic activities, in particular in the case of mergers and public procurement procedures. Under the proposed Regulation, the Commission will have the power to investigate financial contributions granted by public authorities of a non-EU country which benefit companies engaging in an economic activity in the EU and redress their distortive effects, as relevant. In this context, the Regulation proposes the introduction of three tools: - Component 1: a notification-based tool to investigate concentrations involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the EU turnover of the company to be acquired (or of at least one of the merging parties) is EUR 500 million or more and the foreign financial contribution is at least EUR 50 million; - Component 2: a notification-based tool to investigate bids in public procurements involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the estimated value of the procurement is EUR 250 million or more; and - Component 3: a tool to investigate all other market situations and smaller concentrations and public procurement procedures, which the Commission can start on its own initiative (ex-officio) and may request ad-hoc notifications. Ex officio examination of subsidies . The proposal provides that the Commission could, on its own initiative, examine information from any source concerning alleged distortive foreign subsidies, either as a preliminary examination or as a full investigation. It would be able to conduct on-site inspections in the EU and elsewhere. The Commission should take into account the positive effects of the foreign subsidy on the development of the subsidised economic activity in question. It should balance these positive effects against the negative effects of a foreign subsidy in terms of distortion in the internal market. If the negative effects outweigh the positive effects, the Commission could impose remedial measures or accept undertakings from the companies concerned to remedy the distortions. The proposal foresees a range of structural or behavioural remedies, such as divestment of certain assets or prohibition of a certain market behaviour. The Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments for procedural infringements, such as the supply of incorrect or incomplete information in an investigation, and for non-compliance with a Commission decision imposing redressive, interim measures or commitments. Concentration and bids in public procurement As regards mergers and public procurement, the proposal involves a system of ex ante notification of the largest and potentially most distortive case. It sets out the conditions under which a foreign subsidy is considered to distort the internal market. The Commission would have the power, upon notification, to examine information on foreign financial contributions in the context of a proposed merger. Companies should not be allowed to implement the concentration before the conclusion of the Commission's review. The proposal specifies when a concentration should be suspended and sets out the relevant time limits. The proposed Regulation provides that if an undertaking fails to comply with the obligation to notify a subsidised concentration or a financial contribution in the context of public procurement contracts meeting the thresholds, the Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments. Fines and periodic penalty payments could also be imposed in the case of notifications containing incorrect information or in the case of failure to notify. In case of notified transactions, the Commission should also have the power to prohibit the subsidised acquisition or the award of the public procurement contract to the subsidised bidder. Budgetary impact The total administrative expenditure for the implementation of the proposal in 2021-2027 will thus amount to EUR 90.340 million, part of which will be financed from the single market programme.",0.887,0.885,0.865,0.781,0.632,0.88,0.851,0.683,1,0,0,0
5223,European Year of Rail (2021),"PURPOSE: to designate 2021 as the ‘European Year of Rail’. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 11 December 2019, the Commission set out a European Green Deal for the European Union and its citizens. In its resolution of 15 January 2020, the European Parliament welcomed this deal and called for the necessary transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050 at the latest. Transport accounts for a quarter of the Union’s greenhouse gas emissions, and still growing. To achieve climate neutrality, a 90% reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050. The European Green Deal implies to accelerate the shift to sustainable and smart mobility to address these challenges. In particular, a substantial part of the 75% of inland freight carried today by road should shift onto rail and inland waterways. While the share of passenger rail in the Union land transport has only slightly increased since 2007, the share of freight has decreased. Rail has a significant role to play as a game changer to achieve the climate neutrality objective by 2050. It is one of the most environmentally friendly and energy-efficient transport modes. It is the only mode that has consistently reduced its greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions since 1990 and increasingly uses renewable energy sources. 2021 shall be an important year for the Union rail policy: - it will be the first full year where the rules agreed under the Fourth Railway Package will be implemented throughout the Union, namely on the opening of the market of domestic passenger services and on reducing costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the Union; - there is a growing public interest in railways, including in night trains, in a number of Member States, as also illustrated by the popularity of #DiscoverEU; - the international arts festival ‘Europalia’ will dedicate its 2021 edition to the influence of railways on the arts and highlight the role of rail as a powerful promotor of social, economic and industrial change. CONTENT: the proposal aims to designate 2021 as the ‘European Year of Rail’ and responds to the objective of promoting rail transport in line with the objectives set out in the Commission's communication on the European Green Deal. Objectives The objective of the European Year shall be to encourage and support the efforts of the Union, the Member States, regional and local authorities, and other organisations to increase the share of passengers and freight moving by rail. In particular, the European Year shall: - promote rail as a sustainable, innovative and safe mode of transport, in particular by highlighting the role of rail as a game changer to help reaching the Union’s climate neutrality objective by 2050 and by reaching out to the wider public, especially youth; - highlight the European, cross-border dimension of rail, that brings citizens closer together, allows them to explore the Union in all its diversity, fosters cohesion and contributes to integrate the Union internal market; - enhance the contribution of rail to Union economy, industry and society, covering in particular aspects related to regional development, industrial competitiveness, sustainable tourism, innovation, employment, education, youth and culture, and improving accessibility for persons with disabilities; - contribute to promoting rail as an important element of the relations between the Union and neighbouring countries, in particular, in the Western Balkans. Content of the measures As with all European Years in the past, the main objective is to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities and highlight the role of the Union in promoting shared solutions. Measures shall include information and promotion campaigns, events, projects and initiatives at Union, national, regional and local levels. They shall serve to convey key messages and disseminate information about examples of good practice. The European Year shall be an opportunity to encourage Member States authorities and the sector to work together to promote rail transport. Every effort shall be made to ensure that the activities organised in the course of the European Year are tailored to meet the needs and circumstances of each Member State. Member States are therefore requested to appoint a national coordinator responsible for organising their participation in the European Year of Rail. A European steering group, including representatives of the national coordinators, shall be set up. The Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators in order to coordinate the running of the European Year and to exchange information regarding its implementation at national and EU level. Budgetary implications The necessary financial allocation for the implementation of this Decision for the period 2020-2021 is estimated to be EUR 8 million. Implementation of the European Year will involve appropriate funding to be determined in the context of the budgetary procedures for 2020, and 2021 in accordance with the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027.",0.968,0.967,0.946,0.849,0.649,0.926,0.909,0.951,1,0,0,0
9418,Use of technologies for the processing of data for the purpose of combating online child sexual abuse (temporary derogation from Directive 2002/58/EC),"PURPOSE: to enable the continuation of certain activities to combat sexual abuse of children online by creating a temporary derogation from certain provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC (Directive on privacy and electronic communications). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down rules ensuring the right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to the processing of personal data in exchanges of data in the electronic communication sector. Protecting children online is one of the EU's priorities. On 24 July 2020, the Commission adopted an EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse which aims to provide an effective response, at Union level, to the crime of child sexual abuse. It announced that it shall propose the necessary legislation to tackle child sexual abuse online effectively by the second quarter of 2021. Certain providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services are already using specific technologies to detect child sexual abuse on their services and report it to law enforcement authorities and to organisations acting in the public interest against child sexual abuse, and/or to remove child sexual abuse material. These organisations refer to national hotlines for reporting child sexual abuse material, as well as organisations whose purpose is to reduce child sexual exploitation. The ePrivacy Directive does not contain an explicit legal basis for voluntary processing of content or traffic data for the purpose of detecting sexual abuse of children online. However, it does provide that Member States may adopt legislative measures to limit the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in this Directive, which concern the confidentiality of communications and traffic data, for the purpose of the prevention and detection of offences related to sexual abuse of children. Lack of Union action on this issue would risk creating fragmentation shall Member States adopt diverging national legislation. Pending the adoption of the announced long-term legislation, the Commission considers that it is essential to take immediate action to enable the continuation of some current activities to combat sexual abuse of children online. CONTENT: the proposal aims to introduce a temporary and strictly limited derogation from the applicability of certain obligations of the ePrivacy Directive to enable providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services to continue using specific technologies and continue their current activities to the extent necessary to detect and report child sexual abuse online and remove child sexual abuse material on their services from December 2020, pending the adoption of the announced long-term legislation. The proposal therefore contains safeguards to ensure that technologies benefitting from the derogation meet the standards of the best practices currently applied, and thereby limits the intrusiveness to the confidentiality of communications and the risk of circumvention. The personal and other data used when carrying out the activities covered by the derogation set out in this Regulation, as well as the period during which the data is subsequently retained in case of positive results, shall be minimised so as to ensure that the derogation remains limited to what is strictly necessary. The providers shall publish reports on an annual basis on the processing falling within the scope of this Regulation. The proposed Regulation shall apply from 21 December 2020 and shall cease to apply in December 2025. If the long-term legislation announced by the Commission is adopted and enters into force before that date, it shall repeal this Regulation.",0.952,0.951,0.054,0.685,0.491,0.861,0.838,0.024,1,0,0,0
12419,Macro-financial assistance to the Republic of Moldova,"PURPOSE: to provide a further EUR 150 million in macro-financial assistance to Moldova. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the Republic of Moldova have developed a close political and economic relationship over the years. The last Association Agenda for 2017-2019 has been extended over the period of one year (due to the pandemic last year), whilst a new document is under preparation, covering the 2021-2027 period. Moldova's economic ties with the EU are also well developed. The EU continues to be Moldova’s largest trading partner, accounting for 52% of its total trade in 2020. Moldova’s economy has been affected significantly by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the protracted political stalemate in the country after the Presidential elections in November 2020, as well as the recent energy crisis. The situation contributed to Moldova’s sizable financing gap, deteriorating external position, and growing fiscal needs. Following the election in July 2021, the new Moldovan government has demonstrated a strong commitment to further reforms, with an ambitious programme ‘Moldova in good times 2021-2025’, focusing on key policy areas including, among others, justice sector reforms, fight against corruption, good governance and the rule of law. With the renewed reform-commitment and strong political will, the authorities have significantly accelerated on reform implementation, which has also allowed Moldova to successfully complete the COVID-19 macro-financial assistance operation. In view of a worsening economic situation and outlook, Moldova requested a complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union in November 2021. The proposed MFA would help Moldova cover part of its residual external financing needs, which are estimated at USD 480 million, in the context of the new IMF programme over the period of 2021-2025. Given that Moldova is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. CONTENT: the Union will provide macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 150 million available to Moldova, with a view to supporting Moldova's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda. Of that maximum amount, up to EUR 120 million will be provided in the form of loans and up to EUR 30 million in the form of grants. The loans will have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Moreover, the assistance will contribute to covering Moldova's balance of payments needs as identified in the IMF programme. The Commission is considering releasing the assistance in three instalments: - the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2022; - the second instalment could be disbursed in early 2023; - the third tranche could follow later that year or in the first half of 2024, provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. It should be noted that a pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance will be that Moldova respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. The proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. They Commission should regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of developments relating to MFA. Budgetary implications The financial programming of the EUR 150 million assistance over the 2022-2024 period allows for a grant component of EUR 30 million to be financed from the available budget on budget line 14 20 03 01 ‘Macro-financial assistance (MFA) – grants’'. For the loan component of EUR 120 million, the required provisioning at a rate of 9% of the External Action Guarantee will be programmed under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 10.8 million (budget line 14 02 01 70 ‘NDICI – Provisioning of the Common Provisioning Fund’).",0.79,0.819,0.838,0.603,0.456,0.815,0.773,0.512,1,0,0,0

2122,"European citizens’ initiative: temporary measures concerning the time limits for the collection, verification and exAmendmentination stages in view of the COVID-19 outbreak","PURPOSE: to lay down temporary measures concerning the time limits for the collection, verification and examination stages provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/788 on the European citizens' initiative in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Member States have been affected in a dramatic and exceptional way by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of restrictive measures were taken to stop or slow down the transmission of COVID-19, including lockdown measures to restrict the free movement of their citizens, the prohibition of public events, and the closure of shops, restaurants and schools. These measures have inevitably also had a serious impact on European citizens’ initiatives (ECIs), a participative democracy instrument that depends on the engagement of citizens across the EU. The national confinement measures and more generally the omnipresence of the pandemic make it currently nearly impossible for organisers to successfully continue their local campaigning activities and the collection of paper statements of support to help them gather the required statements within the set period of 12 months. Member States and the European institutions have also certain obligations as regards the verification (including certification) of the validity of the collected statements of support and the examination of a successful initiative. These obligations are equally time-bound. Due to the exceptional circumstances, these obligations may not be able to be respected within the set legal time limits. CONTENT: this proposal lays down temporary measures concerning the time limits for the collection, verification and examination stages provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/788 on the European citizens' initiative in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. Collection period In order to preserve the efficacy of the European citizens’ initiative instrument during this pandemic and to provide reassurance and legal clarity to organisers of initiatives the collection, verification or examination of which is ongoing, the Commission proposes to adopt temporary measures to extend by 6 months the current 12-month period for initiatives whose signature collection was ongoing on 11 March 2020, the date on which the COVID-19 epidemic was qualified as a pandemic by the WHO. That extension is based on the assumption that at least in the first six months since 11 March 2020 a majority of Member States or a number of Member States representing more than 35% of the Union population will have measures in place that will substantially hamper the organisers’ possibilities to carry out local campaigning and collect paper statements of support. Where the collection period of an initiative started after 11 March, that period should be extended proportionately. Verification period Similar temporary measures should be taken to allow Member States to request the European Commission for an extension of the verification period in case their competent authorities due to the measures taken to combat the pandemic cannot complete the verification in time. The measures are temporary in nature, as these only apply until end 2022. Examination period The examination period is also subject to specific time limits. The European institutions are required to organise a meeting with the organisers (to be organised by the Commission within one month after submission of a successful initiative) and a public hearing (to be organised by the European Parliament within three months after submission). The organisation of such events may be difficult within the time limits set by Regulation (EU) 2019/788. In such a case, the European institutions should be allowed to organise such events as soon as the public health situation in that country again allows for organising such events. In such cases, the European Commission shall adopt its Communication in response to a valid initiative within three months after the public hearing in the European Parliament. Lastly, this proposed Regulation should be adopted as a matter of urgency, so that situations of legal uncertainty affecting citizens, organisers, national administrations and the Union institutions, in particular where the relevant time periods for the collection of statements of support, verification and examination in respect of a number of initiatives have already ended or are about to end, remain as short as possible. It should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.",0.935,0.962,0.946,0.863,0.596,0.944,0.929,0.951,1,0,0,0
10758,Packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs): key information documents. Extension of the transitional arrangement,"PURPOSE: to extend the transitional arrangement for management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and non-UCITS. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 enables retail investors to better understand and compare packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and make better-informed investment decisions. To meet its objectives, Regulation requires PRIIPs manufacturers to comply with a uniform set of product disclosure requirements and provide retail investors with a key information document (KID) on each PRIIP they offer. Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS within the meaning of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a KID. This arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 supplements Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 by laying down regulatory technical standards with regard to the presentation, content and standard format of the key information document. The Commission adopted Commission Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 to make it easier for management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS. However, the date of application of Delegated Regulation has been set on 1 July 2022 to give those management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and thus for the obligation to draw up a key information document. This proposal is accompanied by a proposal amending Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the use of key information documents by management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and implement the other proposed measure (which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653). Under this proposal, Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 would apply to management companies, investment companies and persons advising on or selling units of UCITS and non-UCITS on the same date as the amendments to Directive 2009/65/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653, i.e. from 1 July 2022.",0.984,0.956,0.946,0.438,0.491,0.926,0.896,0.122,1,0,0,0
9264,EU/Indonesia Agreement: modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union,"The European Parliament adopted by 685 votes to 3, with 6 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Republic of Indonesia pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU28 WTO schedule for the 143 EU agricultural, fish and industrial WTO tariff-rate quotas (TRQs). The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows into the EU27 and the UK during a representative reference period (of 3 years from 2013 to 2015) for all WTO TRQs. The agreed allocation method is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The principle behind the methodology applied is based on trade flows in the EU-27 and the UK over a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff quotas. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch GATT Article XXVIII negotiations with the relevant WTO Members with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO tariff quota concessions. Negotiations with Indonesia resulted in an agreement which was initialled on 28 January 2021 in Geneva.",1.032,0.934,0.959,0.863,0.632,0.954,0.916,0.902,1,0,0,0
12487,Strengthening the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women,"PURPOSE: to establish minimum requirements to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women through pay transparency and enforcement mechanism. PURPOSE: to set up a European Partnership on Metrology jointly undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 2 and 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union enshrine the right to equality between women and men as one of the core values and tasks of the Union. The European pillar of social rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, includes among its principles equal treatment of women and men and the right to equal pay for work of equal value. Despite Directive 2006/54/EC, supplemented in 2014 by a Commission Recommendation on pay transparency, the effective implementation of the principle of equal pay remains problematic in practice in the EU. The gender pay gap in the EU remains at around 14%. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences on female workers make it even more urgent to address this issue. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for more action at EU level to improve the implementation of equal pay provisions. The Council has called on both the Member States and the Commission to act. Following the evaluation of the existing framework on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, the gender equality strategy 2020-2025 announced binding measures on pay transparency. CONTENT: the proposed directive aims to address the persistent inadequacy in the application of the fundamental right to equal pay and to ensure that this right is respected throughout the EU, by setting standards for pay transparency to enable workers to assert their right to equal pay. Member States could provide for a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive. Same work and work of equal value The proposal requires Member States to establish tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of work in line with a set of objective criteria which include educational, professional and training requirements, skills, effort and responsibility, work undertaken and the nature of the tasks involved. The availability of clear criteria at national level will help workers to establish a valid comparator and assess whether they are treated less favourably than the comparator performing the same work or work of equal value. Pay transparency The proposal: - requires employers to provide, prior to the job interview, information on the initial pay level or a corresponding range (based on objective and gender-neutral criteria) to be paid to the future worker in relation to a specific position or job. Employers would not have the right to ask applicants about their pay history in their former employment relationship; - requires employers to make available to workers a description of the gender-neutral criteria used to define their pay and career progression; - gives workers the right to ask their employer for information on their individual pay level and on average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work or work of equal value; - requires employers with at least 250 workers to make publicly accessible certain information, such as the pay gap between female and male workers in their organisation. On the basis of the information provided, employees and their representatives would have the right to ask the employer for clarification of this information; - obliges the employers concerned to carry out a pay assessment in cooperation with employee representatives where the pay information indicates a gender pay gap of at least 5%, which the employer cannot justify on the basis of objective and gender-neutral factors. Better access to justice for victims of pay discrimination With regard to redress and enforcement, the proposal: - requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to enforce the rights and obligations under the Directive; - introduces the right for equality bodies and workers’ representatives or other legal entities to act on behalf or in support of a worker, and for them to bring collective claims to court; - obliges Member States to ensure that any worker who is a victim of sex discrimination in pay can obtain full compensation for the harm caused; - increases the burden of proof on the employer: the employer, not the worker, should prove the absence of discrimination in relation to pay; - provides that the limitation period for bringing a claim under the proposed Directive should be at least three years; - requires Member States to establish specific penalties for infringements of the equal pay rule, including minimum fines.",0.016,0.385,0.932,0.315,0.263,0.657,0.805,0.732,0,1,0,0
12870,"Strengthening Europol’s mandate: cooperation with private parties, processing of personal data, and support for research and innovation","PURPOSE: to strengthen Europol’s mandate to support Member States in preventing and combatting serious crime and terrorism. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU faces a security landscape in flux, with evolving and increasingly complex security threats. Criminals and terrorists exploit the advantages that the digital transformation and new technologies bring about, including the inter-connectivity and blurring of the boundaries between the physical and digital world. The COVID-19 crisis has added to this, as criminals have quickly seized opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modes of operation or developing new criminal activities. These threats spread across borders and manifest themselves in poly-criminal organised crime groups that engage in a wide range of criminal activities. As action at national level alone does not suffice to address these transnational security challenges, therefore the Commission proposes to enhance Europol’s mandate in order to give further support to Member States’ law enforcement authorities. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: this proposal aims to support and strengthen action by the Member States’ law enforcement services and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy. Specific provisions of the new mandate The new mandate should: - ensure effective cooperation between Europol and private parties: terrorists often abuse the services provided by private companies to recruit volunteers, to carry out terrorist attacks and to disseminate their propaganda. The revised mandate would allow private parties to refer such information directly to Europol. The Agency would be able to receive personal data directly from private parties and analyse it to identify all Member States concerned; request personal data from private parties (via the Member State where it is located); and act as a channel for Member States' requests to private parties, in compliance with data protection requirements; - enable Europol to exchange personal data with private parties related to crisis response: the proposal sets out rules for Europol to support Member States in preventing the large scale dissemination, via online platforms, of terrorist content related to on-going or recent real-world events depicting harm to life or physical integrity. Europol would be able to exchange personal data with private parties, including hashes, IP addresses or URLs related to such content; - allow Europol to analyse large datasets (‘big data') to support criminal investigations, considering that the processing of large data sets is an integral part of police work in today's digital world; - improve Europol's cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, including through analytical support to the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and information exchange, and with the European Anti-Fraud Office; - reinforce Europol's role in developing new technologies for law enforcement, helping to equip national law enforcement authorities with modern technologies to counter serious crime and terrorism; - strengthen Europol's data protection framework, accountability and democratic oversight, including by introducing new reporting obligations for Europol to the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group in charge of monitoring its activities. Budgetary implications The proposal would have an impact on the budget and staff needs of Europol. It is estimated that an additional budget of around EUR 180 million and around 160 additional posts would be needed for the overall MFF period to ensure that Europol has the necessary resources to enforce its revised mandate. This increase in staff and budget would give Europol the means to fulfil its strengthened mandate. It would provide the European Counter Terrorism Centre with adequate resources and to enable its EU Internet Referral Unit to monitor and refer all types of terrorist content to online platforms with a 24/7 availability. The revision of Europol's mandate also opens the possibility for Member States to contribute directly to Europol's budget, where necessary and required by existing or new tasks.",0.823,0.874,0.014,0.699,0.456,0.843,0.656,0.0,0,0,1,0
6434,Markets in financial instruments,"PURPOSE: to make targeted adjustments to the requirements of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID II) to facilitate the economic recovery post COVID-19 pandemic. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) lays down rules for investment firms operating in EU financial markets. These rules determine how investment firms should interact with investors and how they should organise the trading venues. The rules on investment services have an important role to play in promoting the recapitalisation of European firms in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, formal burdens that are not strictly necessary should be removed. The Commission therefore strives to recalibrate investor protection requirements to strike the right balance between a sufficient level of transparency for the client, the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for firms. This legislative proposal amending MiFID II is part of a set of measures to facilitate the economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, which includes also legislative proposals amending the Prospectus Regulation the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, for a streamlined application of the regulatory requirements, keeping high safeguards for retail clients while allowing for more flexibility for wholesale clients and ensures that fully functioning commodity markets can play their important role in the recovery of EU economies. This legislative proposal also aims to complement the objectives of the Capital Markets Union to diversify market-based sources of financing for European companies and facilitate cross-border investments. Amendments to information requirements The changes to the current regime provide a precise calibration of the rules applicable to retail clients, professional customers and eligible counterparties. The majority of the proposed changes shall consist of relief for professional clients and eligible counterparties, namely: - the phasing out of paper-based default method: documents shall be provided in electronic format. However, retail clients may opt-in to paper based information; - as regards the indication of costs and charges, the introduction of an exemption for eligible counterparties and professional clients for services other than investment advice and portfolio management. In addition, in case of distance communication all clients using all services shall be able, under certain conditions, to receive costs and charges information just after the transaction; - lighter ex-post reporting obligations: these reports shall no longer apply in respect of eligible counterparties; professional clients shall be able to choose whether or not to receive them; - the temporary suspension of best execution reporting; - the waiver by professional investors of cost-benefit analysis in the event of a change of product during the course of the relationship; - the lifting of the product governance requirements for simple corporate bonds with make-whole clauses (which are investor-protective features). The aim of this exemption is to make more plain vanilla corporate bonds available to retail investors. Measures affecting energy derivatives markets The proposal introduces changes to the regime applicable to commodities with a view to enabling businesses in the real economy to cope with market volatility, while at the same time allowing the emergence of new commodity contracts, which is also important for promoting the international role of the euro. The proposed amendments recalibrate precisely the position limit regime and the scope of the hedging exemption. They shall not concern agricultural commodities, in particular products for human consumption.",0.952,0.901,0.0,0.027,0.246,0.907,0.013,0.0,0,0,1,0
367,EU/USA Agreement on the allocation of a share in the tariff rate quota for imports of high-quality beef,"PURPOSE: to review the functioning of an existing trade agreement between the United States of America and the European Union ensuring an autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef into the EU. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the European Union and the United States concluded a Memorandum of Understanding, revised in 2014, which provided an interim solution to a long-standing dispute in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over imports of US beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. Under the agreement, a 45 000 tonnes quota of non-hormone treated beef was open by the EU to qualifying suppliers. Under WTO rules the quota also had to be made available to non-US suppliers. On 19 October 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations between the EU and the United States on the functioning of the tariff quota. Negotiations with the United States were concluded on 27 February 2019. The signed agreement, subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the EU and the United States on the allocation to the United States of a share in the tariff quota for high-quality beef referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding on the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by the United States to certain EU products, which was concluded in 2009 and revised in 2014. Under the new agreement, the existing quota will remain unchanged but 35 000 out of the total 45 000-tonne TRQ will be ring-fenced for the United States and phased in over a period of 7 years. The autonomous tariff quotas will continue to cover only products complying with EU's high food safety and health standards. This step is key to resolving a long-standing dispute between the EU and the United States on measures imposed by the EU in 1989 on US exports of beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. It also underlines the EU's commitment to a positive transatlantic trade agenda.",0.919,0.769,0.068,0.027,0.351,0.954,0.844,0.0,1,0,0,0
9565,Connecting Europe Facility,"PURPOSE: to renew the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2021-2027. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households’ access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion.",0.048,0.005,0.865,0.014,0.14,0.037,0.026,0.707,0,0,0,0
459,"EU-Switzerland Agreement on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime","PURPOSE: to conclude an agreement between the European Union and Switzerland on the application of certain provisions of Council Decision 2008/615/JHA and Council Decision 2008/616/JHA, as well as Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on combating terrorism and cross-border crime. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/615/JHA) and the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/616/JHA) are intended to improve the exchange of information between the services responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences and to strengthen cross-border police and judicial cooperation between the Member States of the Union. The Prüm Decision contains, inter alia, provisions whereby Member States grant one another, on a mutual basis, access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities (’the Forensic Decision’) lays down the requirements for the exchange of DNA and fingerprint data, in order to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within any other Member State. On 10 June 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Swiss Confederation on the application of certain provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision and the Decision on forensic services. These negotiations were successfully concluded and resulted in the initialling of the agreement on 24 May 2018. The possibility for all the Member States to have access to the national databases of the Swiss Confederation, regarding the DNA, dactyloscopic and vehicle registration data, and the other way around, is undoubtedly of central importance in order to foster and encourage the cross border police cooperation. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Switzerland for the application of some of the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision. This international agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation aims to improve and simplify the automated exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and the associated countries, in order to stimulate international police cooperation. The Agreement lists the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision that shall become applicable to the Swiss Confederation after entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement also sets the provisions for uniform application, dispute settlement, amendments, notifications and declarations. The contracting Parties agree to carry out common review of the agreement no later than five years after its entry into force. The Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period whilst one of the Contracting Parties can terminate the Agreement at any time. The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the adoption and implementation of this Decision. Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.",0.903,0.868,0.986,0.836,0.456,0.981,0.929,0.049,1,0,0,0
1936,Transitional provisions in order to address the impact of COVID-19 crisis (Amendment of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628),"PURPOSE: to amend the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 on emission limits and type-approval for non-road mobile machinery to address the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as ‘Stage V’, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency.",1.016,0.929,0.905,0.877,0.526,0.926,0.909,0.488,1,0,0,0
12038,Regional economic accounts for agriculture,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards regional economic accounts for agriculture. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Eurostat has been compiling European agricultural statistics on agriculture in the European Union for decades. These data collections were evaluated in 2016 and it was found that they needed to be updated to take account of changes in agriculture, the CAP and other related EU policies. The strategy for agricultural statistics to 2020 and beyond is a major programme for the modernisation of EU agricultural statistics run by the European Commission in close cooperation with Member States. The proposed changes are based on the following findings: - Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets up the economic accounts for agriculture (EAA) in the EU by providing for the methodology and time limits for the transmission of agricultural accounts. The regional economic accounts for agriculture (REAA) are a regional adaptation of the EAA. In addition to national figures, regional data help to better understand the diversity that exists between regions and complement the information for the EU, the euro area and individual Member States; - as statistics play a central role in the decision-making process, evidence-based decision-making requires high quality statistics. Quality reports are essential for assessing, improving and communicating the quality of European statistics; - lastly, the EAA provide important annual macroeconomic data to European policy-makers three times a year. The first and second estimates are followed by the final data. The current transmission deadline for the EAA second estimates does not provide much time after the end of the first reference period to collect improved data compared to the data provided for the first EAA estimates. CONTENT: the proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 aims to: - integrate the regional economic accounts for agriculture (REAA) into Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 as regards both the methodology and the appropriate deadlines for data transmission; - allow possible derogations from the regional economic accounts for agriculture (REAA) requirements; - add an article to cover quality reporting requirements; - confer implementing powers on the Commission as regards the arrangements for and the content of the quality reports; - relax the transmission deadlines for the second EAA estimates in order to facilitate improved data quality.",1.032,0.945,0.946,0.014,0.579,0.944,0.935,0.951,1,0,0,0
9422,Interbus agreement: Protocol on international regular and special regular carriage of passengers by coach and bus,"The European Parliament adopted by 613 votes to 29, with 53 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of a Protocol to the Agreement on the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus (Interbus Agreement) regarding the international regular and special regular carriage of passengers by coach and bus. Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol. The protocol will replace the protocol to the Interbus Agreement on the international regular and special regular carriage of passengers by coach and bus which was open for signature between 16 July 2018 and 16 April 2019 but was only signed by the Union, on the basis of Council Decision (EU) 2018/1195. The Protocol covers only the provisions that were necessary to extend the Interbus Agreement to international regular and special regular carriage of passengers by coach and bus, without amending or repeating the common rules of the main Agreement. However, it emphasises the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 with regard to penalties and most serious infringements as well as maintains the obligation to fulfil the four conditions for access to the profession of a road passenger transport operator: effective and stable establishment, good repute, financial standing and professional competence. In addition, in order to safeguard the quality of regular and special regular services and to ensure respect for the rules, a Contracting Party can only sign, conclude, ratify or accede to the Protocol if it has already signed and concluded, ratified or acceded to the main Interbus Agreement.",0.968,0.951,0.932,0.014,0.526,0.954,0.922,0.854,1,0,0,0

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Jordan relations are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Jordan signed an Association Agreement with the Union on 24 November 1997, which entered into force on 1 May 2002. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan. The Jordanian economy has been particularly affected by the conflict that has been raging in Syria since 2011. This regional unrest has caused a considerable deterioration in external revenues and strained public finances. They have affected tourism and foreign direct investment. Regardless of these conflicts, the supply of natural gas from Egypt has been disrupted for several years. In addition, the Jordanian economy has faced a massive influx of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on public finances, public services and infrastructure. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Union has made available more than EUR 2.1 billion to Jordan under different instruments (including EUR 380 million under the two aforementioned MFA programmes) to help the country preserve economic stability, sustain political and economic reform and address its related humanitarian, development and security needs. In addition, the European Investment Bank has allocated around EUR 486 million in project loans to Jordan. A recent evaluation of the implementation of MFA operations concluded that the first MFA programme was adapted to Jordan's economic challenges and in line with EU priorities. The evaluation also found that the programme had been implemented efficiently and in close coordination with the Jordanian authorities, had contributed to preserving macroeconomic stability and has had a positive social impact. In July 2019, given its still difficult economic situation and prospects, Jordan requested further macro-financial assistance from the Union. In this context, the Commission considers that the continued support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Jordan's international partners, of which the EU remains essential. CONTENT: the European Commission proposes to provide Jordan with additional macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 500 million in three instalments in the form of medium and long-term loans. The EU MFA is an exceptional emergency aid instrument designed to respond to serious balance of payments difficulties in third countries. The objective of the proposed MFA is to help Jordan cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2020-2021, reducing the economy’s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities as well as contributing to the debt sustainability. In addition, EU assistance would encourage Jordan to step up its reform efforts through a Memorandum of Understanding, to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities and shall include a package of measures to promote economic adjustment and the implementation of structural reforms. MFA funds shall be made available in the form of low-interest and long-term loans. Disbursements under the proposed programme shall be strictly conditional on the implementation of specific conditions, to be agreed between the EU and Jordan and set out in a Memorandum of Understanding. These conditions should be in line not only with the priorities of the EU-Jordan Partnership, as confirmed at the Brussels III Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region, held from 12 to 14 March 2019, and at the EU-Jordan Association Council on 17 July 2019, but also with the adjustment programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank.",0.903,0.885,1.0,0.836,0.421,1.009,0.935,0.61,1,0,0,0
4502,EU/Seychelles Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Implementation. Protocol (2020-2026),"PURPOSE: to conclude the sustainable fisheries partnership agreement and its implementing protocol (2020-2026) between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between the European Union and Seychelles was signed on 28 February 2007 and entered into force on 2 November 2007 for a duration of six years. The agreement is tacitly renewable, and is therefore still in force. The current 6-year Protocol to the FPA entered into application on 18th January 2014 and will expire on 17th January 2020. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Seychelles with a view to concluding, on behalf of the European Union, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and its Implementing Protocol (2020-2026). At the end of the negotiations, an Agreement and Protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 22 October 2019. The new Agreement repeals and replaces the existing Agreement; it covers a period of six years as does the new Protocol. The purpose of this proposal is to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement and its Implementing Protocol CONTENT: the main aim of the new Agreement is to provide an updated framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to continuing and reinforcing the strategic partnership between the European Union and the Seychelles in the field of fisheries. The aim of the Implementing Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone in accordance with the best available scientific advice and the resolutions and recommendations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone and in the Indian Ocean, in the interest of both parties. In addition, this cooperation will also contribute to promote decent working conditions in fisheries activities. Fishing opportunities The new Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - 40 tuna purse seine vessels; - 8 surface longliners; - support vessels in accordance with the relevant IOTC resolutions. The conclusion of the Agreement and its Implementing Protocol enables to continue and reinforce the strategic fisheries partnership between the European Union and Seychelles. It will create fishing opportunities for Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone. It will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the Fisheries Comprehensive Plan, the monitoring and combating illegal fishing, and the support for the small-scale fisheries sector. Lastly, the Agreement and the Protocol will contribute to Seychelles’ sustainable exploitation of its marine resources and to Seychelles’ fishing economy by promoting growth and decent working conditions, associated with fishing-related economic activities. Budgetary implications The EU annual financial contribution is EUR 5 300 000, based on: - an annual amount for access to the fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone of EUR 2 500 000 equivalent to a reference tonnage, for highly migratory species, of 50 000 tonnes per year; - support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Seychelles, amounting to EUR 2 800 000 per year. This support meets the objectives of Seychelles’ Fisheries Comprehensive Plan. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure, including for the reserve line for protocols not having entered into force at the beginning of the year.",0.919,0.929,0.027,0.356,0.298,0.898,0.883,0.0,1,0,0,0
1047,EC-Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement: fishing opportunities and financial contribution. Extension of the Protocol,"CONTENT: to conclude the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania concerning the extension to the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, expiring on 15 November 2019. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters concerning the extension of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania, expiring on 15 November 2019, was signed. It is now necessary for it to be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania concerning the extension of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, expiring on 15 November 2019. The objective of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters is to enable the European Union and Mauritania to continue to work together on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy and the sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Mauritanian waters and to allow Union vessels to carry out their fishing activities in those waters.",0.935,0.934,0.865,0.027,0.333,0.926,0.903,0.561,1,0,0,0
10759,Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS): the use of key information documents,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the use of key information documents by management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Directive 2009/65/EC, each undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) must provide ‘key investor information’ to help investors understand the essential characteristics of the UCITS and make informed investment decisions. Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a key information document. The arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. The Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and to implement the other proposed measure [which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653] from 1 July 2022. As things stand, as of 1 July 2022 retail investors in UCITS would receive both a key information document in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and key investor information in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC. It is desirable to avoid a situation where retail investors receive two different pre-contractual disclosure documents in respect of the same UCITS. The proposed measures are necessary to reduce the consequences of parallel application of Directive 2009/65/EC and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. CONTENT: this proposal inserts a new article in Directive 2009/65/EC which lays down in a clear, precise and unconditional manner that, where a key information document is drawn up, provided, revised and translated for a UCITS pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, it should be considered as satisfying the requirements applicable to key investor information for the purposes of that Directive.",0.984,0.956,0.946,0.452,0.491,0.926,0.896,0.122,1,0,0,0
12524,Increased pre-financing from REACT-EU,"PURPOSE: to provide for an increased amount of pre-financing to be paid under REACT-EU, which is needed to help Member States meet the challenges posed by the exceptionally high number of people fleeing the war in Ukraine and to support their transition to a resilient economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the recent military aggression by Russia against Ukraine, the European Union and in particular its eastern regions are facing a massive influx of people. This poses an additional challenge for public budgets at a time when Member States’ economies are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and risks undermining the preparation of a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy. Member States are already able to finance a broad range of investments to address migratory challenges under their operational programmes with support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), including from the additional resources made available as Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). The Commission has already taken steps to assist Member States in this regard, through its ‘Cohesion Action for Refugees in Europe’ (CARE) initiative of 8 March 2022. Notwithstanding the room for manoeuvre offered by the CARE package, Member States face additional immediate budgetary pressures arising from the management of mass arrivals of people fleeing Ukraine. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. The Commission therefore considers it necessary, as a temporary and exceptional measure, to increase the amount of pre-financing paid under REACT-EU for all Member States. BACKGROUND: this proposal provides for exceptional and targeted changes to the 2014-2020 legal framework established for the European Structural and Investment Funds and for the Fund for the European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in response to the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the subsequent impact on the European Union and several of its eastern regions in particular. It is proposed to amend Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 and (EU) No 223/2014 in order to provide for an increased percentage of pre-financing to be paid under REACT-EU, which is necessary to respond to this unprecedented situation. In addition to the initial pre-financing, the Commission will pay 4% of the REACT-EU resources allocated to programmes for the year 2021 as additional initial pre-financing in 2022. For programmes in Member States which have had a level of arrivals of persons from Ukraine greater than 1% of their national population between 24 February 2022 and 23 March 2022, that percentage shall be increased to 34%. In order to monitor the use of this additional pre-financing, the final reports on the implementation of ERDF and ESF programmes benefiting from such pre-financing should include information on how the additional amounts received have been used to address the migration challenges linked to Russia's military aggression and have contributed to the recovery of the economy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal only concerns REACT-EU, which is financed by the European Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU. The additional initial pre-financing payments in 2022 will be financed from external assigned revenues. All amounts will be available as external assigned revenues, within the meaning of the Financial Regulation stemming from the Next GenerationEU borrowing operations. The amount paid as additional initial pre-financing will be totally cleared from the Commission accounts not later than when the operational programme is closed, such that the total amount of payments made under REACT-EU will remain unchanged with this proposal. Similarly, the total commitment appropriations under REACT-EU will not be modified.",0.774,0.797,0.851,0.452,0.491,0.824,0.734,0.732,1,0,0,0
294,EU-Ukraine Agreement Amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement,"PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Ukraine amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, entered into force on 1 September 2017. A new type of poultry cut consists of a traditional breast cap with the humerus bones of the wings attached and can, after minimal transformation in the Union, be marketed in the Union as poultry breast. Unlimited imports of those cuts, of which imports from Ukraine reached 55 500 tons in 2018, therefore risk undermining the conditions under which traditional poultry breast cuts may be imported into the Union under the Association Agreement, in particular the quantitative restrictions in the form of a tariff rate quota. On 20 December 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Ukraine with a view to finding a solution by amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement. Those negotiations were successfully concluded on 19 March 2019. CONTENT: the purpose of the draft Council Decision is to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Ukraine amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part.",0.774,0.808,0.068,0.014,0.404,0.944,0.766,0.0,1,0,0,0
7409,EU/Honduras Voluntary Partnership Agreement,"The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Karin KARLSBRO (Renew, SE) on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Honduras on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber products to the European Union. The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. The EU published its Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan in 2003. The plan aims to combat illegal logging around the world. By entering Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with timber producing third countries, the EU opens for imports of legally sourced timber and timber products to enter the Single Market. These agreements are binding trade agreements. They also contribute to better regulation and governance of the forest sector in the exporting country. Honduras was the first Latin American country to initiate and successfully conclude negotiations for a VPA with the EU. These negotiations started in 2013 and were completed in 2018. Honduras is also the first VPA partner that has included indigenous peoples as a separate interest group at the negotiating table. For the EU, this agreement is in line with its objectives under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, the Aichi Targets of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030. Within these frameworks, it is committed to, inter alia, encouraging sustainable forest management, combating deforestation and forest degradation and promoting sustainable development. The Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the EU and Honduras: - establishes the framework, institutions and systems for the timber legality assurance system for the FLEGT licensing scheme; - sets out the framework for monitoring compliance and for independent evaluation of the system; - includes a clear commitment by Honduras to develop legislation to ensure that timber imported in Honduras has been legally harvested in compliance with the applicable legislation in the country of harvest; - establishes a mechanism for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Honduras on the FLEGT licensing scheme, via a Joint Implementation Committee; - establishes principles of stakeholder participation, social safeguards, accountability and transparency, and mechanisms for complaints on, monitoring of and reporting on implementation of the Agreement. The Agreement makes provision for import controls at the EU’s borders, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 on the FLEGT licensing scheme and Regulation (EC) No 1024/2008 laying down detailed measures for implementing it.",0.952,0.951,0.919,0.726,0.561,0.944,0.929,0.049,1,0,0,0
5879,FEAD: specific measures to address the COVID-19 crisis,"PURPOSE: to strengthen the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in order to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and requires exceptional measures to be taken with regard to aid provided to the most deprived under the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The first “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative” (CRII), a package of measures which entered into force on 1 April 2020, introduced a number of important changes to the legislative framework applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds that allow for a more effective response in the current situation. Complementary measures were adopted under the “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus” (CRII Plus). This package also included amendments to Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 (FEAD Regulation), through Regulation (EU) 2020/559 of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing specific measures of additional flexibility and liquidity for Member States to address the COVID-19 pandemic under the FEAD. The direct and indirect effects of the crisis have already taken their toll in many sectors. The process of recovery shall take time and the need for further lockdown measures cannot be excluded. In this context, there is a serious risk that the number of people suffering from food and material deprivation shall increase and therefore further action is required in order to respond to the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure a socially fair recovery in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights. The Commission therefore proposes a further amendment to the Regulation laying down common provisions for the European Structural and Investment Funds (REACT-EU) and the FEAD Regulation in order to provide additional resources to these Funds until 2022. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 so that Member States can provide additional resources to the FEAD until 2022. This shall make additional resources available for basic food and material and accompanying measures, as well as for specific social inclusion measures. The financing of the main post-crisis recovery measures and support for the most deprived may therefore continue uninterrupted. Voluntary increase of resources in response to the COVID-19 outbreak It is proposed that Member States may voluntarily increase the overall resources provided for in the FEAD Regulation to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should consider this possibility taking into account the increase in the number of the most deprived since the emergence of the pandemic. The increase in resources may have an impact on the budgetary commitments for 2020, 2021 and 2022. In order to ensure that Member States have sufficient financial means to prepare for the economic recovery, the proposal provides for a higher level of pre-financing for the rapid implementation of the actions supported by the additional resources. In addition to the pre-financing provided for in the Regulation, the Commission shall pay a pre-financing amount of 50% of the additional resources allocated for the year 2020 following the Commission decision approving the amendment to a programme for the allocation of the additional resources. In order to alleviate the burden on public budgets to repair the damage caused by the crisis, it is foreseen that the additional resources shall not be co-financed. Scope of technical assistance The proposal specifies that at the initiative of the Member States, and subject to a ceiling of 5% of the Fund's allocation at the time of adoption of the operational programme and 5% of the additional resources, the operational programme may finance: - preparatory, management, monitoring, administrative and technical assistance, audit, information, control and evaluation measures necessary for the implementation of the Fund, including the preparation and operating costs of voucher systems if these costs are borne by the managing authority or another public body which is not a partner organisation; - technical assistance measures to partner organisations and any other actor associated with the implementation of the Fund, as well as capacity building measures for partner organisations and any other actor associated with the implementation of the Fund, including measures to stimulate crisis response capacities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions may concern the subsequent programming period, including to ensure the continuation of the support by this Fund through other Funds. Budgetary implications The proposal will lead to: - additional commitments in the year 2020, financed from an increase of the ceiling of the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework; - additional commitments for the years 2021 and 2022, financed from external assigned revenues. The proposal shall trigger additional payments in the years 2020 to 2025.",0.855,0.94,0.932,0.589,0.614,0.926,0.909,0.927,1,0,0,0
3260,Amending Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 as regards specific measures on L-category end-of-series vehicles in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"PURPOSE: to amend the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 as regards specific measures on L-category end-of-series vehicles in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components for L-category vehicles and a sizeable drop in demand for those vehicles. This has led to important delays for manufacturers to clear their stock of Euro 4 vehicles that, according to Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, need to be registered before the application of the environmental Euro 5 step on 1 January 2021. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, motorcycles sales have been highly impacted. Because of Member States authorities’ lockdowns, sales could not take place during the peak season. According to industry sources, it is estimated that around 553 700 Euro 4 vehicles were in stock in March 2020. During the lockdowns, sales went down by 98% and remained sluggish since then. It is therefore likely that not all Euro 4 vehicles currently in stock will be sold by the end of the year. The end-of-series provisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 allow manufacturers to continue to make available on the market, register or enter into service a limited part of a stock of L-category vehicles which cannot be made available on the market or can no longer be made available on the market, owing to the entry into force of new technical requirements against which those vehicles have not been approved. Considering the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is apparent that the provisions on end-of-series do not constitute an appropriate mechanism to address the amount of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that manufacturers will have in stock following the application of the environmental Euro 5 step. CONTENT: in the context of the current COVID-19 epidemic, the main purpose of the proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 is to adapt the provisions relating to the number of end-of-series vehicles in order to allow dealers to sell higher amounts of their stock of Euro 4 vehicles in 2021 only. In order to ensure that the application of these measures is restricted to vehicles that were in stock at the moment of the national lockdowns, the amount of vehicles benefiting from these specific end-of-series measures shall not exceed the number of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that were in stock on 15 March 2020. This proposal: - shall not increase pollutant emissions as the flexibility shall be limited to already produced vehicles at the time of the lockdown; - avoid the need to unnecessarily scrap vehicles that would have been otherwise placed on the market in absence of the crisis; - shall not postpone the entry into force of the Euro 5 step for all newly produced vehicles on 1 January 2021.",1.016,0.94,0.919,0.863,0.649,0.954,0.909,0.78,1,0,0,0
8187,EU/Cuba Agreement: modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union,"The European Parliament adopted by 687 votes to 1, with 8 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Republic of Cuba pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The basis of this approach is that the existing volume of each TRQ would be fully maintained in the future but split across two separate customs territories: the EU27 and the UK. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows into the EU27 and the UK during a representative reference period for all WTO TRQs. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch GATT Article XXVIII negotiations with the WTO Members concerned with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO tariff quota concessions. The negotiations with Cuba resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 3 July 2020.",0.952,0.956,0.946,0.877,0.649,0.944,0.929,0.927,1,0,0,0
10855,Adequate minimum wages in the European Union,"PURPOSE: to establish a framework to improve the adequacy of minimum wages and to increase the access of workers to minimum wage protection. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: adequate minimum wages are a fundamental component of the European model of social market economy. When set at adequate levels, minimum wages protect the income of disadvantaged workers, help ensure a decent living, and limit the fall in income during bad times. During economic recessions, such as the COVID-19 crisis, the role of minimum wages in protecting low-wage workers is essential to support a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery. Principle 6 of the Pillar on ‘Wages’ calls for adequate minimum wages as well as for transparent and predictable wage setting to be put in place, according to national practices and respecting the autonomy of the social partners. Minimum wage protection can be provided by collective agreements (as is the case in six Member States) or by statutory minimum wages set by law (as is the case in 21 Member States). However, many workers are currently not protected by adequate minimum wages in the EU. In the majority of Member States with national statutory minimum wages, minimum wages are too low vis-à-vis other wages or to provide a decent living, even if they have increased in recent years. National statutory minimum wages are lower than 60% of the gross median wage and/or 50% of the gross average wage in almost all Member States. In 2018, the statutory minimum wage did not provide sufficient income for a single minimum-wage earner to reach the at-risk-of-poverty threshold in nine Member States. In this context, the proposed directive aims to ensure that EU workers are protected by adequate minimum wages allowing for a decent living wherever they work. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the quantitative analysis carried out on a scenario based on a hypothetical increase of minimum wages to 60% of the gross median wage shows that it would improve the adequacy of minimum wages in about half of the Member States. Between 10 and 20 million workers would benefit from these improvements. In several countries, improvements in minimum wage protection would result in a reduction of in-work poverty and wage inequality by over 10% and a reduction in the gender pay gap by about 5% or more. CONTENT: the proposed directive establishes minimum requirements at EU level to ensure both that minimum wages are set at an adequate level and that workers can have access to the protection offered by minimum wages, either in the form of a statutory minimum wage or in the form of wages set by collective agreements. The proposal respects Member States’ competence to set higher standards, without prejudice to the role that Member States may entrust to social partners, in accordance with national traditions and in full respect of social partners’ contractual freedom. The proposed Directive: - would apply to workers with an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by law, collective agreements or practice in each Member State, including workers in atypical forms of employment ; - would oblige Member States to take measures to promote the capacity of the social partners to engage in collective bargaining on wages to encourage wage bargaining. In the case of countries where there is a legal minimum wage, the proposal: - requires Member States to provide for national criteria for setting and updating statutory minimum wages that are defined in a stable and clear manner, regular and timely updates and the establishment of consultative bodies; - calls on the Member States, in consultation with the social partners to: (i) limit the use of variations in minimum wages and their application over time and their extent and (ii) provide for the protection of statutory minimum wages against unjustified or disproportionate deductions; - requires effective and timely participation of the social partners in the setting and updating of statutory minimum wages, including through participation in consultative bodies; - Requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that workers have effective access to the protection offered by statutory minimum wages (e.g. strengthening the system of controls and field inspections, informing workers about applicable statutory minimum wages). With a view to monitoring the implementation of this Directive, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council its assessment of developments in the adequacy and coverage of minimum wages on the basis of the information provided by Member States.",0.177,0.429,0.865,0.329,0.579,0.667,0.851,0.732,0,1,0,0
10756,Insolvency proceedings: replacing Annexes A and B to the Regulation,"PURPOSE: to update Annexes A and B of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings to ensure that the scope of the Regulation reflects the current legal framework of the Member States on insolvency. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/848 is an important instrument for judicial cooperation in civil matters at EU level. It contains a comprehensive set of rules directly applicable to cross-border insolvency proceedings which are referred to in Annex A and to types of insolvency practitioners referred to in Annex B. These two annexes list exhaustively, respectively, the insolvency proceedings and the insolvency practitioners provided for in the laws of the Member States and to which the Regulation applies. It is therefore important that these annexes are regularly updated to take account of the current legal situation in the Member States. In October 2020, the Netherlands notified the Commission of recent changes to its national insolvency legislation, introducing a new preventive insolvency regime and new categories of insolvency practitioners. Notifications were subsequently received from Italy, Lithuania, Cyprus and Poland in December 2020. The Commission has analysed the notifications from these Member States carefully to ensure that they meet the requirements of the Regulation. CONTENT: the Commission proposal replaces the lists in Annexes A and B of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists that take into account the information notified by the Netherlands, Italy, Lithuania, Cyprus and Poland. It merely amends these annexes to accurately reflect the content of the national notifications and to adapt the annexes listing the respective national procedures or categories of insolvency practitioners in this area.",0.984,0.956,0.946,0.74,0.649,0.917,0.896,0.927,1,0,0,0
12502,Equivalence of field inspections and of certain seed produced in Bolivia,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Decision 2003/17/EC as regards its period of application and to add Bolivia to the list of third countries for which field inspections of seed producing crops and seed produced in those countries are considered equivalent to EU field inspections and seed production, respectively, in respect of sorghum, maize and sunflower. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that, under certain conditions, field inspections carried out in the third countries listed in its Annex I on certain seed-producing crops are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that, under certain conditions, seed of certain cereal species produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law. Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022. On 29 January 2016, Bolivia submitted a request to the Commission to consider seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia as offering the same assurances as regards identity, health and quality as seed produced in the EU on the basis of official controls carried out by the competent authorities of that country. Following this request, the Commission assessed the relevant Bolivian legislation and carried out an audit of the Bolivian seed production and certification system. The Commission identified shortcomings and made recommendations to Bolivia. As Bolivia addressed these shortcomings by 30 November 2018, the Commission recognised that the Bolivian system in place offered the same assurance as the EU system. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to grant equivalence in respect of field inspections of seed producing crops of sorghum, maize and sunflower carried out in Bolivia and in respect of seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia and officially certified by its authorities. As Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022, it is proposed to extend by 7 years (until 31 December 2029) the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision, in order to avoid any risk of disruption of seed imports into the Union. The proposal will stimulate seed trade between Bolivia and the EU. Granting the EU equivalence would therefore contribute to the maintenance of the continuous supply of high quality seed in the EU. It could also make it more attractive for EU-based companies to invest in the agricultural development of Bolivia given that the EU would become an export market.",0.919,0.885,0.014,0.603,0.544,0.889,0.818,0.805,1,0,0,0
12522,"Medicinal products made available in the UK with respect to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta","PURPOSE: to ensure the continuity of supply of certain medicinal products for human use to Northern Ireland, as well as to Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: pursuant to the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, which is an integral part of the UK Withdrawal Agreement, medicines placed on the market in Northern Ireland must be covered by a valid marketing authorisation issued by the Commission (EU-wide authorisations) or the United Kingdom (UK) in respect of Northern Ireland. These national authorisations should be in compliance with the obligations of the EU acquis for medicinal products. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021) for maintaining batch testing and manufacturing / logistics in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to ensure undisrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it still proves very difficult for certain operators currently based in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to adapt and move relevant regulatory compliance functions (namely, the marketing authorisation holder, quality control (batch) testing, the qualified persons responsible for batch testing pharmacovigilance) to Northern Ireland or the EU in respect of nationally authorised products, as required by the Protocol. Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down rules concerning medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products intended to be placed on the market in the Member States. In order to avoid shortages of medicinal products and to ensure a high level of public health protection, these Directives need to be amended to provide for derogations for medicinal products supplied to Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland from parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal provides for derogations from Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to ensure the long-term continuity of supply of generic and innovative medicines to Northern Ireland from the UK and to address the remaining supply problems in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. The proposal exceptionally allows the following: - the marketing authorisation holder and the manufacturing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - batch checks may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch controls and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland or Malta will be able to purchase and obtain medicinal products from a third country (parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing authorisation and without the need to repeat batch checks; This proposal allows exceptionally that: - a marketing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the manufacturing authorisation holder may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the batch testing may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch testing and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland, or Malta may purchase and obtain medicines from a third country (parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing import authorisation and without re-testing the products; - the competent authorities of the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland may temporarily authorise the supply to patients in Northern Ireland of a medicinal product provided that (i) the medicinal product concerned has obtained a marketing authorisation issued by the competent authority of the United Kingdom for parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; and (ii) the medicinal product concerned is made available to patients or end-users only within the territory of Northern Ireland and is not made available in any Member State; - the UK should comply with EU legislation on the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products for human use when issuing marketing authorisations for Northern Ireland. Malta, Cyprus and Ireland will have certain derogations for a period of three years (until 31 December 2024). In these three countries, during this period, importers of medicinal products from the UK will not be required to hold manufacturing authorisations, nor will such medicinal products be required to undergo batch testing if such testing has already been carried out in the UK. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 as regards a derogation from certain obligations concerning investigational medicinal products made available in the United Kingdom with respect to Northern Ireland as well as in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta.",0.758,0.78,0.851,0.562,0.421,0.824,0.727,0.707,1,0,0,1
8186,"Exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting for the period 2021-2027 (Pericles IV programme): extension to the non-participating Member States","PURPOSE: to extend the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (Pericles) to the non-participating Member States of the European Union (2021-2027). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation providing for the continuation of the Pericles programme in the post-2020 multiannual financial framework. Article 139 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that measures governing the use of the euro referred to in Article 133 thereof shall not apply to the Member States with derogation. However, the exchange of information and staff and the assistance and training measures implemented under the Pericles programme should be uniform throughout the Union. The Commission recalled the significant role of non-participating Member States under the current extension of the Pericles 2020 programme. The National bank of Croatia, for instance, organised a series of conferences under the title ‘Balkan network for euro protection’ gathering experts from South East Europe to reinforce the protection of the euro against counterfeiting in this area, known for its distribution and production of euro counterfeits. The Commission therefore considered it necessary to take the necessary measures to ensure the same level of protection for the euro in the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency. CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the Regulation establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (Pericles IV) to the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency. Entities from those Member States shall be considered eligible for funding when they are competent authorities within the meaning of the programme.",1.016,0.956,0.946,0.849,0.649,0.944,0.929,0.927,1,0,0,0
1050,International road passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions: cabotage operations between Italy and Switzerland,"PURPOSE: to empower Italy to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the course of international road passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between the two countries. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the two-way carriage of passengers and goods by road between Switzerland and the EU is regulated by the Land Transport Agreement between the EU and Switzerland ('EU Agreement'). Under the EU Agreement, the transport of passengers by coach and bus between two points situated on the territory of the same Contracting Party by carriers established in the territory of the other Contracting Party, known as cabotage, is not authorised. This means that the carriers operating the passenger services which cross the border can only carry passengers across the border or within the territory of the Contracting Party they are established in. Bus and coach operators established in Switzerland may not carry passengers between two points on the German side of the border and operators established in the EU may not carry passengers between two points on the Swiss side of the border. However, Article 20(2) of the EU Agreement specifically allows pre-existing rights under bilateral agreements concluded between individual EU Member States and Switzerland that were in force at the time of conclusion of the EU Agreement to continue to be exercised. The border regions of Italy and Switzerland are closely integrated. Many Italians commute to work in Switzerland and vice versa and there is vibrant cross-border passenger traffic by road. A number of bus and coach services are offered which cross the border and thus connect the border regions of the two countries. By letter dated 7 February 2018, Italy informed the Commission that it would like to negotiate and conclude an agreement with Switzerland which authorises cabotage operations during the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between the two countries. Switzerland informed the Commission that it was also interested in concluding such an agreement. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to empower Italy to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the respective border regions of Italy and Switzerland in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between the two countries, provided that there is no discrimination between carriers established in the Union and no distortion of competition. Cabotage operations allow increasing the load factor of the vehicles which increases the economic efficiency of the services. The authorisation of cabotage operations in the context of the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between Italy and Switzerland would allow the carriers involved to become more competitive and efficient. This could further strengthen the close integration of these border regions. In order to ensure that the cabotage operations concerned do not excessively alter the functioning of the internal market for coach and bus services, as established by Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, their authorisation should be subject to the conditions that there is no discrimination between carriers established within the Union and no distortion of competition. For the same reason, cabotage operations should only be authorised in the border regions of Italy in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between Italy and Switzerland. As border regions of Italy shall be considered the regions Piedmont and Lombardy and the autonomous regions Valle d'Aosta and TrentinoAlto Adige. This proposal is based on a request by Germany and concerns only this Member State. A similar request has been received by Italy which is subject to a parallel procedure.",1.032,0.962,0.919,0.836,0.596,0.944,0.909,0.829,1,0,0,0
8728,Transitional provisions in order to address the impact of COVID-19 crisis (amendment of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628),"PURPOSE: to extend the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 on emission limits and type-approval for non-road mobile machinery to address the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits for gaseous and particulate pollutants and EU type-approval procedures for various categories of engines for non-road mobile machinery. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Regulation (EU) 2020/1040 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 was adopted. The aim of this Regulation was to postpone certain deadlines that manufacturers could no longer meet without sustaining serious economic damage due to the unexpected disruptions in the supply chain. This concerned machinery that use so-called ‘transition engines’ in the power range <56kW and >130kW, and whose production had to be completed by 30 June 2020 and placing on the market by 31 December 2020. Under the amended Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, manufacturers were provided with an additional 12 months to produce and place on the market the machinery fitted with those engines. However, due to the continued supply chain and production disruptions caused by the COVID-19 second and third waves, manufacturers will not be able to meet the 2021 deadlines applicable to the machinery fitted with transition engines in the power range between 56kW and 130kW, and above 300kW without sustaining serious economic damage. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to postpone the deadlines to avoid that transition engines can no longer be fitted in the machinery in time and are then scrapped. CONTENT: in view of the current situation and to ensure legal certainty and to avoid possible market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for the construction and placing on the market of machinery equipped with certain transition engines. The extension of the relevant periods should be 6 months for the production of machinery equipped with these engines and 9 months for the placing on the market.",1.0,0.94,0.919,0.836,0.579,0.954,0.922,0.171,1,0,0,0
1453,Conclusion of the EU-Georgia Common Aviation Area Agreement,"PURPOSE : to conclude the Common Aviation Area Agreement between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part PROPOSED ACT : Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the EU, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND : the Common Aviation Area Agreement between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part has been negotiated under a mandate received from the Council in June 2009. Air services between the EU and Georgia presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Georgia. It is part of the EU neighbourhood policy to replace this network of bilateral agreements through the establishment of a Common Aviation Area between the EU and its neighbours. The negotiating mandate set the objective of establishing a Common Aviation Area (CAA) between the EU and Georgia. This would extend the rules and provisions of the single market for air transport in the EU to a large extent to Georgia in which European and Georgian airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, a draft Agreement with Georgia was initialled by the two sides on 5 March 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Agreement ensures the gradual establishment of an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area. A report prepared for the Commission in 2008 by consultants, estimated that an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area would generate 25,000 extra passengers and consumer benefits of up to EUR 17 million in the first effective year of market opening. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee which will be responsible for reviewing the implementation of the Agreement and its effects. LEGAL BASE : CONTENT : The Agreement aims at: - gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; - non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators based on the principles of the EU Treaties; - Alignment of the Georgian aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement provides for the possibility for Georgia to join the main multilateral aviation agreement with European countries, the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) signed in 2006. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implication for the Union budget.",0.984,0.956,0.905,0.603,0.561,0.944,0.929,0.732,1,0,0,0
767,EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement,"PURPOSE: to conclude the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Vietnam, on the other. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In December 2009, the Council agreed on the principle of launching bilateral negotiations with individual ASEAN countries based on the authorisation and negotiating directives of 2007, whilst preserving the strategic objective of a region-to-region agreement. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007 and supplemented in October 2013 to include investment protection, the Commission negotiated with Vietnam an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. Vietnam is a vibrant economy of more than 90 million inhabitants, with the fastest growing middle class in ASEAN, and a young and dynamic workforce. With its high literacy rate and education levels, comparatively low wages, good connectivity and a central location within ASEAN, more and more foreign investors are choosing Vietnam as their hub to service the Mekong region and beyond. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Vietnam, on the other. The agreement, signed subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. The EU-Vietnam IPA will ensure a high level of investment protection, while safeguarding the EU’s and Vietnam’s rights to regulate and pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as the protection of public health, safety and the environment.",0.774,0.797,0.014,0.192,0.158,0.806,0.669,0.0,1,0,0,0
1016,Temporary measures concerning the validity of certificates and licences (omnibus),"PURPOSE: to extend the time limits laid down in Union law for the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations, and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in certain areas of transport legislation in the context of COVID 19. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that affect normal activity of the competent authorities in the Member States and the work of transport undertakings as regards the administrative formalities to be completed in different transport sectors that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of the relevant measures. Those extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on various areas covered by Union transport law. In particular, transport operators and other persons concerned may not be able to complete the necessary formalities or procedures to comply with certain provisions of Union law related to the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations or to complete other steps necessary to maintain their validity. This is the case, for instance, with driving licences, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers, Community licences and driver attestations for the provisions of road haulage services, rail single safety certificates or authorisations, boatmasters’ certificates or port security assessments etc. It is most likely that those certificates, licences, authorisations which, in accordance with Union law, would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 could not be renewed in due time. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt temporary provisions extending the validity of those certificates, licences or authorisations that would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and ensure that they remain valid during a reasonable period of time during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down specific and temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in response to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the area of road, rail and inland waterways transport and maritime security. This proposal concerns specific provisions that affect the application of several Directives and Regulations:  Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which (lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses with the objective to ensure safety on European roads). Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (provides for the mutual recognition of the driving licences issued by Member States based on a Union model driving licence). Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (defines the harmonised minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness testing). Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator). Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lay down common rules for access to the international road haulage market and the international market for coach and bus services, respectively). Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/798 (regulate safety certification and authorisation in the Union). Directive 2007/59/EC of the European Parliament (lays down rules on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union). Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (establishes a single European railway area). Directive 96/50/EC (lays down conditions for obtaining boatmasters’ certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union). Directive (EU) 2016/1629 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels). Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down rules on ship and port facility security). Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down measures to enhance port security in the face of threats of security incidents). This Regulation should be adopted as a matter of urgency, so that situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors, in particular where the relevant time limits have already expired, remain as short as possible.",0.984,0.967,0.932,0.863,0.649,0.944,0.812,0.878,1,0,0,0
12416,Status Agreement between the EU and Moldova on Frontex operational activities,"The European Parliament adopted by 543 votes to 34, with 10 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on operational activities carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in the Republic of Moldova. Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As of 11 March 2022, over 310 000 refugees had entered the Republic of Moldova from Ukraine following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In just the first two weeks of the war, more than two million refugees – around 4% of Ukraine’s population – mainly fled westward from the encroaching Russian forces. Moldovan border management authorities are thus now facing the twin challenges of regulating the influx and subsequent outflow of potentially hundreds of thousands of refugees, including monitoring the smuggling of weapons. Furthermore, some 12% of the territory of the country is not under the control of Moldovan authorities, including a large portion of Moldova’s border with Ukraine. On 14 March 2022, the Council adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Moldova as regards actions by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency on the territory of Moldova. On 17 March 2021, on the basis of a written procedure, delegations confirmed their agreement on the proposal for a Council Decision on the signature of the Status Agreement with Moldova. The Agreement was signed the same day, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The aim of the agreement is to allow the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to deploy border management teams from the permanent contingent to Moldova. The agreement regulates all aspects necessary for the deployment of the Border Management Teams from the European Border and Coast Guard Standing Corps in the Republic of Moldova, where the members of the teams may exercise executive powers. A status agreement will allow Frontex to assist Moldova in border management, by deploying teams capable of assisting the Moldovan authorities in tasks such as registration and border checks.",0.79,0.824,0.851,0.603,0.439,0.815,0.76,0.171,1,0,0,0
9419,Recognition of third countries certificates in inland navigation,"PURPOSE: to amend the transitional provisions of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 on the recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation to cover certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2017/2397 lays down transitional measures concerning the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued before 18 January 2022 (the day following the expiry of the period for the transposition of the Directive). In general, the documents concerned remain valid on the EU inland waterways for which they were valid before that date, for a maximum of 10 years. However, apart from the Rhine navigation licences referred to in Directive 96/50/EC, those transitional measures do not apply to the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries that are currently recognised by Member States under their national requirements established before the entry into force of the Directive or their international agreements. Consequently, from 17 January 2022, third country documents will be recognised in the EU only once the Commission has adopted an implementing act under the Directive granting recognition in the EU to the documents issued by that third country. Given that the procedure for recognition of third country documents is based on the assessment of the certification systems in the requesting third country, it is unlikely that the recognition procedure will be completed before 17 January 2022. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to introduce transitional provisions applicable to third country documents recognised in certain Member States before 18 January 2022, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the system of recognition of third country documents provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and to avoid any disruption of the labour market in the inland waterway transport sector. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States to continue to recognise third country documents based on their national requirements established before the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 (16 January 2018). The recognition should be limited to inland waterways situated in the territory of the Member State concerned and should not apply beyond 17 January 2032. The scope of this transitional measure could only cover documents issued by a third country before the cut-off date (18 January 2023). The proposed amendment clarifies that certificates of qualification issued by a third country in exchange for the certificates covered by the transitional arrangements should be valid on all inland EU waterways, provided that the third country concerned has obtained recognition in accordance with Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and that the requirements for the exchange applied by that third country have been found to be identical to those laid down in the Directive with regard to the Member States.",1.016,0.951,0.932,0.37,0.526,0.954,0.922,0.951,1,0,0,0
9441,Internal Security Fund,"PURPOSE: to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. Regulation BACKGROUND: over recent years, security threats have intensified and diversified in Europe. Terrorism, serious and organised crime, itinerant crime, drug trafficking, corruption, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings and arms, among others, continue to challenge the internal security of the Union. The challenges the Union is facing, notably from international terrorism, cannot be managed by individual Member States alone and without the financial and technical support of the EU. Security has an inherently cross-border dimension and therefore a strong, coordinated Union response is required. Financial support provided under this Regulation shall contribute in particular to strengthening national and Union capabilities in the security area. The Commission proposes to multiply EU funding for internal security by factor of 1.8 compared to the current period (2014-2020), so as to ensure a high level of security within the Union while strengthening the role of decentralised agencies in this area. The new internal security fund builds on the investments and achievements of its predecessor instruments: (i) the security and safeguarding liberties programme; (ii) the instrument for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management (ISF-P) and (iii) the drugs component of the Justice programme. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The proposed scope builds largely on the current Regulation for the Internal Security Fund-Police, while taking into account new policy developments, such as the European security agenda, the fight against terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime, and the new interoperability agenda. Objectives : the new enhanced fund shall contribute to a high level of security in the Union, in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime. Its specific objectives shall be to: increase the exchange of information among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant Union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; intensify cross-border joint operations among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities in relation to serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; support effort at strengthening the capabilities in relation to combating and preventing crime including terrorism in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the Member States. Actions funded shall be implemented in full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity. Actions limited to maintaining public order at national level shall not be eligible. Member State support : the allocation of the funding to the programmes of the Member States shall be based on a distribution key of three criteria: (i) the gross domestic product; (ii) size of the territory and; (iii) population of the state. It is proposed to weigh the different criteria as follows: 45% to inverse proportion to the gross domestic product, 40% to proportion to the size of population and 15% to proportion to the size of the territory of the Member State. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for projects with real European added value or to meet urgent needs and emergency funding to Member States. Coordination between EU policies : the enhanced ISF shall be coherent with and complementary to other Union financial programmes, notably the cohesion policy funds and Horizon Europe, as well as the Integrated Border Management Fund and the Asylum and Migration Fund. Furthermore, work under the internal security fund shall be consistent with that of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The Commission proposes to allocate an amount of EUR 1.12 billion (in current prices) to EU agencies in the field of security. The proposed Regulation does not cover the funding for these agencies. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 2.5 billion (in current prices) to the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The financial envelope shall be used as follows: EUR 1.5 billion allocated to Member States to enable them to build long-term resilience in the field of security; EUR 1 billion allocated to the thematic mechanism to address unforeseen security challenges and to enable a rapid response to emergency situations.",0.0,0.0,0.932,0.151,0.211,0.028,0.0,0.902,0,0,0,0
8730,ETIAS consequential amendments: borders and visa,"PURPOSE: to define the technical amendments necessary to fully set up the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 of the European Parliament and of the Council created the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) for third-country nationals exempt from the requirement to be in possession of a visa when crossing external borders. It laid down the conditions and procedures to issue or refuse a travel authorisation. ETIAS enables consideration of whether the presence of those third-country nationals in the territory of the Member States would pose a security, illegal immigration or high epidemic risk. The ETIAS Regulation provides that the personal data contained in the applications will be compared with the data contained in records, files or alerts: - in alerts recorded in other EU information systems or databases (the ETIAS Central System, the Schengen Information System (SIS), the Visa Information System (VIS), the Entry/Exit System (EES) or Eurodac), and the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN); - in Europol data; - in the Interpol databases (the Interpol Stolen and Lost Travel Document database (SLTD) or the Interpol Travel Documents Associated with Notices database (TDAWN)). Not all data are collected or recorded in the same way in the other EU information systems and Europol data. For instance, ‘first names of parents of applicants’ are collected by ETIAS, but not in most of the other systems to be queried by ETIAS. In order to enable the verification referred to in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1240, it is necessary to amend the legal acts establishing the European Union's information systems to ensure interoperability with ETIAS. Without this interoperability, ETIAS cannot enter into service. CONTENT: the proposal defines the technical amendments necessary to fully set up the ETIAS system. It amends the legal acts establishing the EU information systems that are necessary for establishing their relation with ETIAS. As a result, it is necessary to amend Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) 2018/1240, (EC) No 767/2008, (EU) 2017/2226, (EU) 2018/1861 (SIS border) in order to connect the ETIAS Central System to the other EU information systems and to Europol data and to specify the data that will be sent to and from those EU information systems and Europol data. As compared to the ETIAS Regulation, this proposal only specifies in more details which data is to be compared to which data in the other EU information systems and provides with the necessary amendments as regards granting access rights to those other systems to ETIAS Central and National Units. This proposal therefore presents amendments to the ETIAS Regulation to specify that the ETIAS Central System would build upon the EES Central System’s hardware and software components in order to establish a shared identity repository for the storage of the identity alphanumeric data of both ETIAS applicants and third-country nationals registered in EES. This shared identity repository would be the basis for the implementation of the common identity repository once the co-legislators adopt the legislative proposals on the interoperability of information systems. The proposal builds on the Schengen acquis on the crossing of external borders and visas. It therefore takes into account the consequences of the various protocols and agreements signed with the associated countries.",0.984,0.951,0.014,0.863,0.561,0.917,0.039,0.0,0,0,1,0
9741,Community plant variety rights: extension of the term for certain varieties,"PURPOSE: to extend the term of Community plant variety rights for the species asparagus and the species groups flower bulbs, woody small fruits and woody ornamentals by five years. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) and the Commission have carried out an analysis to determine whether there are, for the species of asparagus as well as for species groups of flower bulbs, woody small fruits and woody ornamentals, technical difficulties in breeding which require expenditure on research activities over a long period of time, if the multiplication of propagating material takes time, if the new varieties have a commercial value only in the long term and if the return on investment of the research activities is only possible at a fairly late stage of protection compared to other horticultural or agricultural crops. The analysis carried out shows that, for the species concerned, the term of protection should be extended by five years in order to establish a legal environment conducive to an equitable remuneration of research and breeding activities. CONTENT: the proposal for a regulation aims to extend the term of Community plant variety rights from 25 to 30 years for species of asparagus as well as for species groups flower bulbs, woody small fruits and woody ornamental crops. To this end, the proposed Regulation extends the term of protection for the species concerned by five years. This extension would apply to protection granted before, on or after 1 July 2021. It is also proposed to reduce the duration of the extension if national property rights for these varieties have been effective in a Member State prior to the grant of a Community plant variety right and, accordingly, would already have allowed breeders to exploit their varieties.",0.613,0.951,0.878,0.863,0.614,0.944,0.909,0.61,1,0,0,0
466,CAP: Financial discipline as from financial year 2021 and flexibility between pillars in respect of calendar year 2020,"PURPOSE: to ensure certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers in the year 2020 and ensuring the respect of budgetary ceilings for the EAGF by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in relation to the financing of the CAP, certain amendments of Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Horizontal Regulation) are needed to ensure that the financial discipline mechanism that makes it possible to respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation on the multi-annual financial framework can still operate for financial years post 2020. In relation to Direct Payments, Regulation (EU) 2019/288 amended Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy (Direct Payments Regulation) to extend the flexibility between pillars foreseen for calendar years 2015-2019 to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. This regulation sets up the amounts to transfer from the rural development to direct payments envelope as a percentage of the amount allocated to support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021 by Union legislation adopted after the adoption by the Council of the relevant Regulation pursuant to Article 312(2) TFEU. The relevant Union legislation may not be in place by the time the Member States need to notify their decision to transfer. To make it possible to apply the flexibility from rural development to direct payments, it is appropriate to establish the maximum amount that can be transferred based on a fixed amount and not a percentage. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulations (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council aims to ensure the continuity of certain elements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a transitional period of one year from 2014-2020 until the rules on CAP strategic plans are applied, in line with the Commission's proposal on support for CAP strategic plans. Update of the reference for determining a financial discipline rate Expenditure under the EAGF within a given financial year shall respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For that purpose, the said Regulation provides for the determination of a financial discipline adjustment rate. However, currently the relevant provisions refer to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 which only sets the relevant ceilings for the period 2014-2020. To ensure that the ceiling for the financing of market related expenditure and direct payments post 2020 will also be respected, the legal reference of Articles 16 and 26 should be amended to include the regulation to be adopted by the Council for financial year 2021 onwards. Change of the basis for notifying the transfer from rural development to direct payments To ensure continuity in the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between the two pillars, already decided by the colegislators in Regulation (EU) 2019/288, the Commission proposed to replace the percentage of transfer by maximum absolute amounts based on the current maximum percentages. Member States had the possibility to review by 1 August 2019 the percentage of their national ceiling for direct payments, which they want to allocate to Voluntary Coupled Support (VCS), as well as their detailed support decisions (i.e. list of support measures and their envelopes, targeting, etc.). This review, if any, will apply from claim year 2020. In addition, Member States will have to notify only by 31 December 2019 or shortly thereafter their transfers between pillars affecting their national ceiling for direct payments for calendar year 2020. Budgetary implications The amounts included in the transitional proposal are in line with amounts proposed for the CAP under Heading 3 in the proposal covering the Multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. For market-related expenditure financed by the EAGF, allocations under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be adjusted to the level which were proposed for the same sectors in the proposal on support for the CAP strategic plans, for financial year 2021. The amendments of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 ensure that a financial discipline adjustment rate can be determined in financial years 2021 and onwards where the expenditure forecasts for the measures financed under the EAGF net ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings would be exceeded. Thereby, the amendment potentially decreases expenditure under EAGF to the maximum level agreed for the fund in the multiannual financial framework. The amendment of the flexibility provision for calendar year 2020 (financial year 2021) is a technical adjustment to ensure applicability of the provision and does not have any financial implications compared to those intended for the existing provision. The review option for the voluntary coupled support may lead to financial reallocations between measures within the Member States but these will remain within the national ceiling and as such do not require additional financing.",0.935,0.857,0.959,0.781,0.421,1.037,0.857,0.659,1,0,0,0
5201,Certain aspects of railway safety and connectivity with regard to the Channel Tunnel,"PURPOSE: to establish interim measures to ensure the continuity of cross-border rail services with the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaries of a Channel fixed link, signed in Canterbury on 12 February 1986, established an intergovernmental committee to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transition period set out in the withdrawal agreement, unless otherwise provided, EU law will no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and, as regards the part of the Channel Fixed Link under French jurisdiction, the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be a national safety authority under Union law. The safety authorisations for the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager and safety certificates for railway undertakings operating through the Fixed Link issued by the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be valid. By Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council, France was empowered to negotiate, sign and conclude an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety and interoperability rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link, with the aim of maintaining a unified safety regime. However, it is unlikely that such agreement will enter into force by the end of the transition period. In the light of the economic importance of the Channel Fixed Link to the EU, it is essential that the Channel Fixed Link continue to operate after 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in view of the end of the transitional period referred to in the withdrawal agreement, the proposed Regulation lays down transitional provisions for certain safety certificates and safety approvals issued under Directive 2004/49/EC and for certain licences of railway undertakings issued under Directive 2012/34/EU. In concrete terms, the proposal: - extends the validity of safety authorisations of the infrastructure manager by two months and the validity of safety certificates and licences of railway undertakings by nine months; - also extends by nine months the validity of the operating licences issued by the United Kingdom under Directive 2012/34/EU in order to allow railway undertakings to continue to operate up to the Calais-Fréthun border-crossing station and thus ensure connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom; - provides that such authorisations, certificates and licences are subject to Directive (EU) 2016/798 and Directive 2012/34/EU respectively and requires their holders of to cooperate with the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority and provide the necessary information; the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority must monitor that the holders of these authorisations, certificates and licences comply with EU law; - confers implementing powers on the Commission to withdraw the benefit conferred on the holders of the approvals/certificates and licences in question, where compliance with EU requirements is not ensured.",1.016,0.956,0.946,0.822,0.684,0.907,0.922,0.927,1,0,0,0
813,False and Authentic Documents Online (FADO) system,"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Roberta METSOLA (EPP, MT) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Border and Coast Guard and repealing Council Joint Action n°98/700/JHA, Regulation (EU) n° 1052/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) n° 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council. As a reminder, the False and Authentic Documents Online system (FADO) was established by Joint Action 98/700/JHA within the General Secretariat of the Council. Over the past years, the Agency has developed expertise in the area of document fraud. The Agency is therefore to take over the administration as well as the operation and technical management of FADO from the General Secretariat of the Council. It shall be ensured that, during the transitional period, FADO remains fully operational until the transfer has been effectively carried out and the existing information has been transferred to the new system. The ownership of the existing data should then be transferred to the Agency. The proposed Regulation aims to repeal Council Joint Action 98/700/JHA. The committee recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission's proposal. The main amendments concern the following: Subject matter The aim of the proposed Regulation is to constitute a new legislative basis for governing FADO. Its purpose is to provide up-to-date information on authentic and false documents and to contribute to the fight against document and identity fraud by sharing information on security features and potential fraud characteristics in authentic and false documents between the competent national authorities, with third parties, such as Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and, where applicable, with third countries, territorial entities, international organisations, other entities subject to international law and private entities, and on authentic documents with the general public. Scope FADO shall contain information on specimen travel, identity, residence and civil status documents, driving licenses and vehicle licenses issued by Member States and falsified versions of such documents in their possession. It may also contain other related official documents that are used when applying for travel, residence or identity documents issued by Member States, and, where applicable, by third countries, territorial entities and international organisations. It should be noted that the proposed Regulation shall not affect the competence of Member States relating to the recognition of passports, travel documents, visas or other identity documents. Categories of documents and data contained in FADO FADO shall include the following: - information, including images, on specimen documents, their security features, on false, forged, counterfeit or pseudo documents and their fraud characteristics; - summary information on forgery techniques; - statistics on detected false documents; - recommendations on effective ways of detecting specific methods of forgery. Member States shall transmit without delay to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (the ‘Agency’) all the data on specimen and fraudulent travel, identity, residence and civil status documents, driving licenses and vehicle licenses in relation to which they are data controller under the applicable Union data protection law. When the Member States become data controller in respect of additional data on such documents and licenses, they shall also transmit them without delay to the Agency. Responsibilities of the Agency The Agency shall: - be responsible for establishing FADO in accordance with this Regulation. It shall ensure the functioning of FADO 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and provide for the its maintenance and updating; - provide the Member States’ competent authorities with near real-time assistance in the detection and identification of falsified documents. FADO’s architecture and access thereto Members proposed that FADO’s architecture shall enable different levels of access rights to FADO. Only document experts from the Member States’ authorities competent in the area of document fraud, such as border police and other law enforcement authorities, shall have access to FADO in an unrestricted manner. Protection and processing of personal data Member States shall ensure that individuals whose personal data are used on specimen and falsified documents are protected in accordance with the relevant applicable rules, including as regards the processing of their personal data in FADO. Personal data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the purposes of FADO. FADO should contain personal data in the form of a facial image or alphanumerical data only insofar as they are related to the security features in a specimen document or the method of falsification of a falsified document.",0.887,0.83,0.865,0.808,0.439,0.898,0.877,0.146,1,0,0,0
9262,Regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman’s duties,"The European Parliament adopted by 623 votes to 9, with 61 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the regulation of the European Parliament laying down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman’s duties (Statute of the European Ombudsman) and repealing Decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom. The legislative procedure to adopt the Statute of the European ombudsman is of special constitutional and institutional nature. On the one hand, Parliament has an authentic right of legislative initiative, the so-called direct right of initiative. On the other hand, consent of the Council is required and the Commission must give its opinion. Given the approval of the Council and the European Commission’s favourable opinion, Parliament adopted the regulation laying down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties. In concrete terms, the proposed regulation: - sets out the conditions under which a complaint can be made to the Ombudsman; - provides for procedures to be followed when the Ombudsman's enquiries reveal maladministration; - allow the Ombudsman, without prejudice to his or her primary duty, which is to handle complaints, to conduct own-initiative inquiries whenever he or she finds grounds, and in particular in repeated, systemic or particularly serious instances of maladministration; - provides for the possibility for the Ombudsman to conduct an enquiry to identify maladministration in the context of raising alerts. The Ombudsman should have access to all elements required for the performance of his or her duties. To that end, the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should provide the Ombudsman with any information that he or she requests for the purposes of an inquiry. The Ombudsman and his or her staff should be obliged to treat in confidence any information which they have acquired in the course of their duties, without prejudice to the Ombudsman's obligation to inform the authorities of the Member States of facts which might relate to criminal offences and have come to his or her attention in the course of an inquiry. The Ombudsman should also be able to inform the Union institution, body, office or agency concerned of the facts that call into question the conduct of a member of their staff. Where necessary for the effective performance of his or her duties, the Ombudsman should be given the possibility to cooperate and exchange information with the authorities of the Member States, in compliance with the applicable national and Union law, and with other Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, in particular those responsible for the defence and protection of fundamental rights. The draft regulation stipulates that the Ombudsman should be appointed by the European Parliament at the beginning of the parliamentary term and for the duration thereof, chosen from among persons who are citizens of the Union and who offer all requisite guarantees of independence and competence. General conditions should also be laid down inter alia concerning the cessation of the Ombudsman's duties, the replacement of the Ombudsman, incompatibilities, the remuneration of the Ombudsman and the privileges and immunities of the Ombudsman. The seat of the Ombudsman should be that of the European Parliament.",0.258,0.907,0.959,0.726,0.614,0.954,0.916,0.951,1,0,0,0
6579,Equivalence of forest reproductive material produced in the UK,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Decision 2008/971/EC as regards the equivalence of forest reproductive material produced in the United Kingdom to such material produced in the EU. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in view of the end of the transitional period provided for in the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom has applied to the Commission for recognition of the equivalence, from 1 January 2021, of forest reproductive material produced in that country with that produced in the EU in accordance with the respective Union law. The Commission has examined the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom. It has concluded that forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, produced in the United Kingdom is equivalent to forest reproductive material produced in the EU, since the former affords the same assurances as regards the approval of its basic material and the measures taken for its production with a view to marketing as the latter. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the Union recognises the equivalence of forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, with the respective material produced within the Union. This recognition is based on an examination of the legislation applicable in the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and systems in place are equivalent to those of the Union. Following the addition of the United Kingdom to the list of countries in Annex I to Decision 2008/97/EC, imports into the Union of forest reproductive material from the United Kingdom would be authorised.",1.032,0.956,0.027,0.863,0.579,0.944,0.922,0.902,1,0,0,0
