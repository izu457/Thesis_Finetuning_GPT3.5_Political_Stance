9568,Visa Information System (VIS): visa processing,"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report by Carlos COELHO (EPP, PT) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, Regulation (EC) No 810/2009, Regulation (EU) 2017/2226, Regulation (EU) 2016/399, Regulation XX/2018 [Interoperability Regulation], and Decision 2004/512/EC and repealing Council Decision 2008/633/JHA. The committee recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission's proposal as follows. Scope of the Visa Information System (VIS) Members believe that the proposed reform shall be the extension of the scope of the Visa Information System (VIS) to include long-stay visas and residence permits. This change shall increase the security of external borders and better secure the rights of long-term residents. Purpose of the VIS As regards short-stay visas, the VIS shall facilitate the exchange of data between Member States on visa applications and decisions, with a view to facilitating and accelerating the visa application procedure. With regard to long-stay visas and residence permits, the VIS shall: (i) support a high level of security in all Member States by contributing to the assessment of whether the applicant or holder of a document is considered to pose a threat to public policy, internal security; (ii) facilitate checks at external border crossing points and enhance the effectiveness of checks within the territory of the Member States. For all visas, the VIS shall assist in the identification of missing persons and contribute the prevention of threats to the internal security of any of the Member States, namely through the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences in appropriate and strictly defined circumstances. Members proposed that Council Decision 2004/512/EC establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) be repealed and fully integrated into the VIS Regulation. The architecture of the system shall also reflect the expansion of its scope and usage: long stay visas and residence permits, queries by the entry-exit system and the new interoperability architecture. The VIS would be based on a centralised architecture. The central VIS system, the uniform national interfaces, the web service, the carrier gateway and the VIS communication infrastructure shall share and re-use as much as technically possible the hardware and software components of respectively the entry/exist central (EES Central System), the EES national uniform interfaces, the ETIAS carrier gateway, the EES web service and the EES communication infrastructure. Data processing Processing of personal data within the VIS by each competent authority shall not result in discrimination against applicants, visa holders or applicants and holders of long-stay visas, and residence permits on the grounds of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. It shall fully respect human dignity and integrity and fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including the right to respect for one’s private life and to the protection of personal data. Particular attention shall be paid to children, the elderly and persons with a disability and persons in need of international protection. Children's fingerprints Given that children are a particularly vulnerable group, Members propose that the collection of special categories of data, such as fingerprints, from children should be subject to stricter safeguards and a limitation of the purposes for which these data may be used to situations where it is in the child’s best interests, including by limiting the retention period for data storage. Data transfer Personal data obtained by a Member State pursuant to this Regulation should not be transferred or made available to any third country, international organisation or private entity established in or outside the Union. As an exception to that rule, however, it should be possible to transfer such personal data to a third country or to an international organisation where such a transfer is subject to strict conditions and necessary in individual cases in order to assist with the identification of a third-country national in relation to his or her return. Access to the system by centralised European agencies In the case of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Members believe it is essential that this agency has access to the system. However, they proposed restricting access for return teams while reinforcing access to statistics for the purpose of risk analysis. Links with other systems and interoperability Members intend to ensure the utmost coherence with other systems, in particular ETIAS, including its safeguards. Checks against other databases should also be carried out for holders of long-stay visas and residence permits. However, in order to provide appropriate guarantees, Members specified which controls should be carried out. They also specified the specific measures following each hit, both to protect third-country nationals and to ensure the confidentiality of information. Any hit resulting from the queries which cannot automatically be confirmed by VIS shall be manually verified by the national single point of contact. Depending on the type of data triggering the hit, the hit should be assessed either by consulates or by a national single point of contact, with the latter being responsible for hits generated in particular bylaw enforcement databases or systems. Each Member State shall designate a national authority, operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which shall ensure the relevant manual verifications and assessment of hits for the purposes of this Regulation. Entry into force Members proposed enhancing reporting mechanisms and setting a deadline of a maximum of two years to have this reformed VIS up and running."
1040,EU-Montenegro status agreement on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Montenegro,"The European Parliament adopted by 568 votes to 109, with 11 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Status Agreement between the European Union and Montenegro on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Montenegro. Following the recommendation of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement. The proposed Council Decision aims to approve the Status Agreement between the European Union and Montenegro on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Montenegro as foreseen in the Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 on the European Border and Coast Guard. Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 explicitly provides that, in cases where it is envisaged that European Border and Coast Guard teams will be deployed to a third country, in actions where the team members will have executive powers, or where other actions in third countries require it, a status agreement shall be concluded by the Union with the third country concerned. The purpose of the Status Agreement is to provide a legally binding framework that should set out the scope of the operation, the rules on civil and criminal liability, and the tasks and powers of the deployed members of the teams. The status agreements should also guarantee the full respect of fundamental rights and should establish dedicated complaints mechanisms to be used in case of fundamental rights violations during these operations. The Status Agreement with Montenegro is one of several similar agreements concluded with the Western Balkan countries. It would allow for joint operations, rapid border interventions and/or return operations to take place on the territory of Montenegro with the involvement of the Agency. The return operations would relate solely to third country nationals being returned from the European Union to Montenegro."
5217,Fishing authorisations for Union fishing vessels in United Kingdom waters and fishing operations of United Kingdom fishing vessels in Union waters,"PURPOSE: to establish provisional measures concerning fishing authorisations for Union fishing vessels in UK waters and fishing operations by UK fishing vessels in Union waters after the end of the transitional period referred to in the UK withdrawal agreement. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of targeted contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the basic Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy), Union fishing vessels enjoy equal access to EU waters and resources subject to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. From the end of the transitional period, the Common Fisheries Policy would no longer apply to the United Kingdom. The UK waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will then no longer be part of EU waters. To ensure sustainable fisheries and given the importance of fishing for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the authorisation procedures for fishing vessels. CONTENT: the proposal would amend EU Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 in order to create the appropriate legal framework valid until 31 December 2021, or until the date of conclusion of a fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom - whichever is earlier - on the continued reciprocal access of EU and UK vessels to each other's waters after 31 December 2020. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following the end of the transition period. The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ""reciprocity"", i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters on a basis satisfactory to the Union. Consequently, authorisations would only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them."
10759,Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS): the use of key information documents,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the use of key information documents by management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Directive 2009/65/EC, each undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) must provide ‘key investor information’ to help investors understand the essential characteristics of the UCITS and make informed investment decisions. Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a key information document. The arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. The Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and to implement the other proposed measure [which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653] from 1 July 2022. As things stand, as of 1 July 2022 retail investors in UCITS would receive both a key information document in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and key investor information in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC. It is desirable to avoid a situation where retail investors receive two different pre-contractual disclosure documents in respect of the same UCITS. The proposed measures are necessary to reduce the consequences of parallel application of Directive 2009/65/EC and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. CONTENT: this proposal inserts a new article in Directive 2009/65/EC which lays down in a clear, precise and unconditional manner that, where a key information document is drawn up, provided, revised and translated for a UCITS pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, it should be considered as satisfying the requirements applicable to key investor information for the purposes of that Directive."
6434,Markets in financial instruments,"PURPOSE: to make targeted adjustments to the requirements of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID II) to facilitate the economic recovery post COVID-19 pandemic. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) lays down rules for investment firms operating in EU financial markets. These rules determine how investment firms should interact with investors and how they should organise the trading venues. The rules on investment services have an important role to play in promoting the recapitalisation of European firms in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, formal burdens that are not strictly necessary should be removed. The Commission therefore strives to recalibrate investor protection requirements to strike the right balance between a sufficient level of transparency for the client, the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for firms. This legislative proposal amending MiFID II is part of a set of measures to facilitate the economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, which includes also legislative proposals amending the Prospectus Regulation the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, for a streamlined application of the regulatory requirements, keeping high safeguards for retail clients while allowing for more flexibility for wholesale clients and ensures that fully functioning commodity markets can play their important role in the recovery of EU economies. This legislative proposal also aims to complement the objectives of the Capital Markets Union to diversify market-based sources of financing for European companies and facilitate cross-border investments. Amendments to information requirements The changes to the current regime provide a precise calibration of the rules applicable to retail clients, professional customers and eligible counterparties. The majority of the proposed changes shall consist of relief for professional clients and eligible counterparties, namely: - the phasing out of paper-based default method: documents shall be provided in electronic format. However, retail clients may opt-in to paper based information; - as regards the indication of costs and charges, the introduction of an exemption for eligible counterparties and professional clients for services other than investment advice and portfolio management. In addition, in case of distance communication all clients using all services shall be able, under certain conditions, to receive costs and charges information just after the transaction; - lighter ex-post reporting obligations: these reports shall no longer apply in respect of eligible counterparties; professional clients shall be able to choose whether or not to receive them; - the temporary suspension of best execution reporting; - the waiver by professional investors of cost-benefit analysis in the event of a change of product during the course of the relationship; - the lifting of the product governance requirements for simple corporate bonds with make-whole clauses (which are investor-protective features). The aim of this exemption is to make more plain vanilla corporate bonds available to retail investors. Measures affecting energy derivatives markets The proposal introduces changes to the regime applicable to commodities with a view to enabling businesses in the real economy to cope with market volatility, while at the same time allowing the emergence of new commodity contracts, which is also important for promoting the international role of the euro. The proposed amendments recalibrate precisely the position limit regime and the scope of the hedging exemption. They shall not concern agricultural commodities, in particular products for human consumption."
10910,Union tariff rate quota for high quality beef from Paraguay,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards Union tariff rate quota for high quality beef from Paraguay. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the Union and the UK notified the other Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that their current market access level will be maintained but apportioned respectively between the Union and the United Kingdom. The methodology for this apportionment, as well as the new EU-27 volumes, are laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Paraguay has a tariff rate quota of 1 000 tonnes for high quality bovine meat (order number 094455), which is not included in the EU’s WTO schedule. This tariff rate quotas was erroneously included in the apportionment exercise and thus reduced to 711 tonnes on the EU-27 side without any corresponding volume being opened on the UK side. This means Paraguay’s market access has been reduced from 1 000 tonnes to 711 tonnes with application as of 1 January 2021. It is therefore appropriate to restore this tariff quota to its original volume. This initiative is in line with the EU’s ongoing actions to ensure that the consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU are dealt with in an orderly manner. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/216 in order to restore the correct volume (1000 tonnes) of tariff quota No 094455 for EU-27. The row relating to order number 094455 (High quality meat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen from Paraguay) would thus be deleted from the Annex, Part A of Regulation (EU) 2019/216."
9566,Measures necessary for the implementation of the Protocol on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel,"The European Parliament adopted by 627 votes to 40, with 29 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision amending Decision 2003/76/EC establishing the measures necessary for the implementation of the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. Parliament gave its consent to the draft Council decision. The Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) is an EU funding programme that finances research projects in the coal and steel sectors. The RFCS has its own legal bases standing outside the Multiannual Financial Framework. The Commission proposal foresees amendments to the current Decision 2003/76/EC. It aims to allow for the sale of part of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation for the period 2021-2027 in order to provide an annual allocation to the RFCS of EUR 111 million to finance research in the coal and steel sectors, namely: - EUR 40 billion to fund collaborative research in these sectors and; - EUR 71 billion to fund research into breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel making and research projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closure, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism. The proposal does not create any new liabilities to be charged to the General Budget under the current multiannual financial framework (MFF). With the exception of some carry-over due to payment requests still to be satisfied within the annual allocation, the assets will stabilise after 2027 and will not be further reduced. In other words, based on the proposal the assets left intact after 2027 should still be intact in 2050, bar the (positive or negative) effect of the ECSC portfolio performance."
9419,Recognition of third countries certificates in inland navigation,"PURPOSE: to amend the transitional provisions of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 on the recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation to cover certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2017/2397 lays down transitional measures concerning the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued before 18 January 2022 (the day following the expiry of the period for the transposition of the Directive). In general, the documents concerned remain valid on the EU inland waterways for which they were valid before that date, for a maximum of 10 years. However, apart from the Rhine navigation licences referred to in Directive 96/50/EC, those transitional measures do not apply to the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries that are currently recognised by Member States under their national requirements established before the entry into force of the Directive or their international agreements. Consequently, from 17 January 2022, third country documents will be recognised in the EU only once the Commission has adopted an implementing act under the Directive granting recognition in the EU to the documents issued by that third country. Given that the procedure for recognition of third country documents is based on the assessment of the certification systems in the requesting third country, it is unlikely that the recognition procedure will be completed before 17 January 2022. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to introduce transitional provisions applicable to third country documents recognised in certain Member States before 18 January 2022, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the system of recognition of third country documents provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and to avoid any disruption of the labour market in the inland waterway transport sector. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States to continue to recognise third country documents based on their national requirements established before the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 (16 January 2018). The recognition should be limited to inland waterways situated in the territory of the Member State concerned and should not apply beyond 17 January 2032. The scope of this transitional measure could only cover documents issued by a third country before the cut-off date (18 January 2023). The proposed amendment clarifies that certificates of qualification issued by a third country in exchange for the certificates covered by the transitional arrangements should be valid on all inland EU waterways, provided that the third country concerned has obtained recognition in accordance with Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and that the requirements for the exchange applied by that third country have been found to be identical to those laid down in the Directive with regard to the Member States."
8190,Agreement EU/USA/Iceland/Norway: Time Limitations on Arrangements for the Provision of Aircraft with Crew,"PURPOSE: to approve the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway was negotiated by the Commission, as authorised by the Council on 21 December 2016. This Agreement is based on the Air Transport Agreement (ATA) between the EU and the United States, which was signed on 25 and 30 April 2007. The EU-US ATA is the most important air transport agreement in the world, providing more than 75 million seats per year, and as such a cornerstone of the EU’s external aviation policy. The ATA between the EU and the US foresees an open wet-lease regime between the parties. The negotiating directives set out the general objective of negotiating a Wet Lease Agreement with the aim of providing precision to the relevant provisions of the ATA and abolishing time limitations for wet lease arrangements affecting the EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to authorise, on behalf of the Union, the conclusion of the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland, and the Kingdom of Norway. The Wet Lease Agreement will resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the application of the wet lease provisions of the ATA, and as such contribute to the well-functioning of the transatlantic aviation relationship The Agreement confirms the establishment of clear and non-restrictive wet lease arrangements involving the airlines of the Parties, thereby providing more precision to the respective provisions of the ATA. The Wet Lease Agreement not only resolves the current dispute on the application of the relevant provisions of the ATA, it also provides clarity and legal certainty for future arrangements affecting EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers."
1938,Amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 as regards the resources for the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative,"PURPOSE: to adapt the amount of resources available for economic, social and territorial cohesion as regards the resources allocated to the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down common rules and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds. The general budget of the Union for the financial year 2020 amended the total amount of resources for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing the commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI in 2020 by EUR 28 333 334 in current prices and by increasing the total amount of commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI for the entire programming period to EUR 4 556 215 406 in current prices. For 2020, the additional resources of EUR 23.7 million in 2011 prices shall be financed by the global margin for commitments within the margin of the multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020. The Commission considers that there is an urgent need to amend the YEI support programmes in order to include the additional resources allocated to the specific allocation for the YEI before the end of 2020. It has explored the scope for manoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers it necessary to propose amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. CONTENT: in line with the adopted budget for 2020, the Commission proposes to increase the commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI by EUR 28 333 334 in current prices, bringing the total amount for 2020 to EUR 145 million in current prices. The proposal further specifies that the relevant provisions that have been introduced to facilitate the programming of the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2019 shall also apply to the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2020. The proposed amendment is estimated to result in additional payments of EUR 3 million in 2020."
462,Accession of Solomon Islands to the EU-Pacific States Interim Partnership Agreement,"PURPOSE: to approve, on behalf of the European Union, Solomon Islands' accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Union, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. The Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, which establishes a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement, was signed in London on 30 July 2009. The Interim Partnership Agreement has been provisionally applied by Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Samoa since 20 December 2009, 28 July 2014 and 31 December 2018, respectively. The Agreement lays down the provisions regarding the accession of other Pacific Island States. In accordance with the Agreement, Solomon Islands submitted to the Council on 4 June 2018 an application for membership and an offer of market access. The Commission examined Solomon Islands' offer and, after modifications, has found it acceptable. Accordingly, the Commission concluded negotiations with Solomon Islands on 23 October 2018. CONTENT: the draft Council decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of Solomon Islands' accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Union, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, subject to the deposit of the Act of Accession by Solomon Islands. The EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement, which offers asymmetric market access to Solomon Islands and allows it to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation, while providing a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection. It further contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate Solomon Islands' exports into the EU. Over the course of its implementation, the EPA will largely relieve EU exporters of industrial products to Solomon Islands from paying customs duties. Indeed, the EPA covers 90.3% of tariff lines, or 83% of the EU's export volume over 15 years. The Agreement also contains provisions on sustainable development. In accordance with the Agreement, the Union and Solomon Islands are to apply the Agreement on a provisional basis ten days after they have notified each other in writing that the necessary procedures have been completed."
12522,"Medicinal products made available in the UK with respect to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta","PURPOSE: to ensure the continuity of supply of certain medicinal products for human use to Northern Ireland, as well as to Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: pursuant to the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, which is an integral part of the UK Withdrawal Agreement, medicines placed on the market in Northern Ireland must be covered by a valid marketing authorisation issued by the Commission (EU-wide authorisations) or the United Kingdom (UK) in respect of Northern Ireland. These national authorisations should be in compliance with the obligations of the EU acquis for medicinal products. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021) for maintaining batch testing and manufacturing / logistics in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to ensure undisrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it still proves very difficult for certain operators currently based in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to adapt and move relevant regulatory compliance functions (namely, the marketing authorisation holder, quality control (batch) testing, the qualified persons responsible for batch testing pharmacovigilance) to Northern Ireland or the EU in respect of nationally authorised products, as required by the Protocol. Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down rules concerning medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products intended to be placed on the market in the Member States. In order to avoid shortages of medicinal products and to ensure a high level of public health protection, these Directives need to be amended to provide for derogations for medicinal products supplied to Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland from parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal provides for derogations from Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to ensure the long-term continuity of supply of generic and innovative medicines to Northern Ireland from the UK and to address the remaining supply problems in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. The proposal exceptionally allows the following: - the marketing authorisation holder and the manufacturing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - batch checks may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch controls and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland or Malta will be able to purchase and obtain medicinal products from a third country (parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing authorisation and without the need to repeat batch checks; This proposal allows exceptionally that: - a marketing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the manufacturing authorisation holder may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the batch testing may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch testing and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland, or Malta may purchase and obtain medicines from a third country (parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing import authorisation and without re-testing the products; - the competent authorities of the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland may temporarily authorise the supply to patients in Northern Ireland of a medicinal product provided that (i) the medicinal product concerned has obtained a marketing authorisation issued by the competent authority of the United Kingdom for parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; and (ii) the medicinal product concerned is made available to patients or end-users only within the territory of Northern Ireland and is not made available in any Member State; - the UK should comply with EU legislation on the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products for human use when issuing marketing authorisations for Northern Ireland. Malta, Cyprus and Ireland will have certain derogations for a period of three years (until 31 December 2024). In these three countries, during this period, importers of medicinal products from the UK will not be required to hold manufacturing authorisations, nor will such medicinal products be required to undergo batch testing if such testing has already been carried out in the UK. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 as regards a derogation from certain obligations concerning investigational medicinal products made available in the United Kingdom with respect to Northern Ireland as well as in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."
6581,Equivalence of field inspections and equivalence of checks on practices for the maintenance of varieties of agricultural plant species carried out in the UK,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Decisions 2003/17/EC and 2005/834/EC as regards the equivalence of field inspections and the equivalence of checks on practices for the maintenance of varieties of agricultural plant species carried out in the United Kingdom. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in view of the end of the transitional period provided for in the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom has submitted to the Commission a request for recognition of equivalence, from 1 January 2021, of fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of fibre and oil plants produced in the United Kingdom with fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of oil plants produced in the Union. The United Kingdom has also requested the recognition of the equivalence as regards the checks on practices for the maintenance of varieties carried out in the United Kingdom pursuant to those Directives. The Commission has carried out a review of the relevant legislation in the United Kingdom. It has concluded (i) that the requirements and the system in force are equivalent to those of the Union and offer the same guarantees as the Union system; (ii) that the checks on practices for the maintenance of such varieties carried out in the United Kingdom afford the same assurances as those carried out by the Member States. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the equivalence of field inspections, and of checks on practices for the maintenance of seed-producing crops of cereal species and the equivalence of the seed produced have been recognised. This recognition is based on an examination of the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and system in place offer the same guarantees as the Union's system. Following the addition of the United Kingdom on that list, the imports of seeds from the United Kingdom into the Union, as well as the maintenance of the respective varities in that country, should be allowed."
1930,Requests on urgent procedures - Transitional provisions in order to address the impact of COVID-19 crisis (Amendment of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628),"PURPOSE: to amend the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 on emission limits and type-approval for non-road mobile machinery to address the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as ‘Stage V’, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."
367,EU/USA Agreement on the allocation of a share in the tariff rate quota for imports of high-quality beef,"PURPOSE: to review the functioning of an existing trade agreement between the United States of America and the European Union ensuring an autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef into the EU. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the European Union and the United States concluded a Memorandum of Understanding, revised in 2014, which provided an interim solution to a long-standing dispute in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over imports of US beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. Under the agreement, a 45 000 tonnes quota of non-hormone treated beef was open by the EU to qualifying suppliers. Under WTO rules the quota also had to be made available to non-US suppliers. On 19 October 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations between the EU and the United States on the functioning of the tariff quota. Negotiations with the United States were concluded on 27 February 2019. The signed agreement, subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the EU and the United States on the allocation to the United States of a share in the tariff quota for high-quality beef referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding on the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by the United States to certain EU products, which was concluded in 2009 and revised in 2014. Under the new agreement, the existing quota will remain unchanged but 35 000 out of the total 45 000-tonne TRQ will be ring-fenced for the United States and phased in over a period of 7 years. The autonomous tariff quotas will continue to cover only products complying with EU's high food safety and health standards. This step is key to resolving a long-standing dispute between the EU and the United States on measures imposed by the EU in 1989 on US exports of beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. It also underlines the EU's commitment to a positive transatlantic trade agenda."
9421,European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights,"The European Parliament adopted by 546 votes to 69, with 79 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Parliament gave its consent to the proposal for a Council Regulation. The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) provides information, assistance and expertise on fundamental rights issues and promotes and protects fundamental rights in the EU. The amendment to the scope simply reflects the consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty for the scope of the Agency’s activities, which became ‘Union law’ instead of ‘Community law’, and therefore encompasses the area of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (the former so-called “third pillar” of the European Union). All the other amendments proposed are to align the founding Regulation with the Common Approach and with the Framework Financial Regulation, in order to enhance the efficiency, relevance and governance of the Agency."
1047,EC-Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement: fishing opportunities and financial contribution. Extension of the Protocol,"CONTENT: to conclude the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania concerning the extension to the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, expiring on 15 November 2019. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters concerning the extension of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania, expiring on 15 November 2019, was signed. It is now necessary for it to be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania concerning the extension of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, expiring on 15 November 2019. The objective of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters is to enable the European Union and Mauritania to continue to work together on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy and the sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Mauritanian waters and to allow Union vessels to carry out their fishing activities in those waters."
459,"EU-Switzerland Agreement on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime","PURPOSE: to conclude an agreement between the European Union and Switzerland on the application of certain provisions of Council Decision 2008/615/JHA and Council Decision 2008/616/JHA, as well as Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on combating terrorism and cross-border crime. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/615/JHA) and the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/616/JHA) are intended to improve the exchange of information between the services responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences and to strengthen cross-border police and judicial cooperation between the Member States of the Union. The Prüm Decision contains, inter alia, provisions whereby Member States grant one another, on a mutual basis, access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities (’the Forensic Decision’) lays down the requirements for the exchange of DNA and fingerprint data, in order to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within any other Member State. On 10 June 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Swiss Confederation on the application of certain provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision and the Decision on forensic services. These negotiations were successfully concluded and resulted in the initialling of the agreement on 24 May 2018. The possibility for all the Member States to have access to the national databases of the Swiss Confederation, regarding the DNA, dactyloscopic and vehicle registration data, and the other way around, is undoubtedly of central importance in order to foster and encourage the cross border police cooperation. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Switzerland for the application of some of the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision. This international agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation aims to improve and simplify the automated exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and the associated countries, in order to stimulate international police cooperation. The Agreement lists the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision that shall become applicable to the Swiss Confederation after entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement also sets the provisions for uniform application, dispute settlement, amendments, notifications and declarations. The contracting Parties agree to carry out common review of the agreement no later than five years after its entry into force. The Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period whilst one of the Contracting Parties can terminate the Agreement at any time. The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the adoption and implementation of this Decision. Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application."
6125,Temporary measures concerning the validity of certificates and licences (Omnibus II),"PURPOSE: to authorise, exceptionally in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extension of the validity of certificates, licences or authorisations and of certain time limits in certain areas of transport legislation. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extended for a period of 6 months (or 7 months in some cases) the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and postponed the completion of certain periodic checks and continuing training which, under the relevant EU legislation, should have taken place during the period between 1 March 2020 (or 1 February 2020 in some cases) and 31 August 2020. Some Member States have submitted reasoned requests to the Commission for authorisation to extend certain periods again. The Commission has adopted six decisions authorising such extensions. Despite some improvements in the situation during the summer of 2020, the persistence of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2020 forced Member States to maintain or even reinforce the measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. As a consequence, transport operators may not be able to complete the formalities or procedures necessary to comply with certain provisions of EU law on the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or approvals, or on the completion of periodic checks and continuous training, or to take other necessary steps to maintain their validity, as was the case in spring 2020. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to adopt measures to remedy these problems and to ensure both legal certainty and the proper functioning of the legal acts concerned. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and to the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in response to the exceptional situation arising from the spread of COVID-19 in the fields of road, rail and inland waterway transport and maritime security during reference periods subsequent to those referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698. The proposal provides for adaptations, in particular for certain time limits, as well as the possibility for the Commission to authorise extensions on the basis of a request submitted by any Member State by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Such extensions should be limited to what is necessary in view of the period during which the completion of formalities, procedures, checks and training are likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, should not exceed six months. The proposal concerns specific provisions which affect the application of several directives and regulations concerning in particular: - the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers for driving licences; - tachographs in road transport; - the periodic technical inspection of motor vehicles and their trailers; - the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; - access to the international road haulage market and access to the international market for coach and bus services; - railway safety, the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union and the rules establishing a single European railway area; - the conditions for obtaining boatmasters' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the Union, technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and the improvement of ship and port facility security. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency so that the situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors are minimised."
8184,Just Transition Fund,"PURPOSE: to establish a Just Transition Fund to assist territories facing economic and social transformation as part of their transition to a climate-neutral economy by 2050. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy is one of the main strategic objectives of the Union. On 12 December 2019, the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. The proposed Regulation implements one of the priorities set out in the Communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal and is part of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which provides for specific funding under the Just Transition Mechanism in the context of cohesion policy. The Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) shall provide targeted support to the regions and sectors most affected by transition due to their dependence on fossil fuels or industrial processes that are high emitters of greenhouse gases, to help them mobilise at least EUR 100 billion over the period 2021-2027 and thus mitigate the socio-economic impact of transition. The JTM shall be additional to the contribution made by the EU budget through all instruments directly related to the transition, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund plus (ESF+). It shall have three main sources of funding: (1) a Just Transition Fund, (2) a dedicated scheme under InvestEU and (3) a Public Sector Loan Facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims at establishing the Just Transition Fund (JTF), which is one of the pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism implemented under cohesion policy. Subject matter The aim of the JTF is to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned. In line with the JTF specific objective, actions supported by the JTF should directly contribute to alleviate the impact of the transition by financing the diversification and modernisation of the local economy and by mitigating the negative repercussions on employment. Programming The programming process, including the identification of the territories for intervention and corresponding actions will be agreed in a dialogue between the Commission and each Member State. It will be steered by the European Semester process. Taking into account the Commission’s analysis, Member States shall prepare one or more territorial just transition plans, providing an outline of the transition process until 2030, consistent with the National Energy and Climate Plans and the transition to a climate neutral economy and identifying subsequently the most impacted territories that should be supported. The proposal also establishes a framework for measuring the achievements of the JTF using the relevant indicators and a mechanism for adjusting support if the targets are not met. Scope of support The Fund would essentially provide grants to the regions. The projects funded should contribute to a transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy. The Fund would support, inter alia, the following activities: - productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; - investments in research and innovation activities and in fostering the transfer of advanced technologies; - investments in the deployment of affordable clean energy technologies and infrastructure, in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energies; - investments in strengthening the circular economy, including through waste prevention and reduction, resource efficiency, reuse, repair and recycling; - the up-skilling and reskilling of the affected workers, with the aim of helping them to adapt to new employment opportunities, as well as providing jobsearch assistance to jobseekers and their active inclusion into the labour market. Budget The Fund shall be endowed with EUR 7.5 billion (at 2018 prices) for the period 2021-2027 in addition to what the Commission has proposed for the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). It shall support the ""Investment for jobs and growth"" objective of the new regulation on common provisions (CPR) in all Member States. Member States will complement their Just Transition Fund allocation from their resources under the ERDF and the ESF+ through a specific and definitive transfer mechanism. Member States will also provide national resources to complement the Union resources. The level of Union co-financing will be set according to the category of region in which the identified territories are located. The overall financing capacity of this fund will exceed EUR 30 billion and may reach EUR 50 billion."
9441,Internal Security Fund,"PURPOSE: to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. Regulation BACKGROUND: over recent years, security threats have intensified and diversified in Europe. Terrorism, serious and organised crime, itinerant crime, drug trafficking, corruption, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings and arms, among others, continue to challenge the internal security of the Union. The challenges the Union is facing, notably from international terrorism, cannot be managed by individual Member States alone and without the financial and technical support of the EU. Security has an inherently cross-border dimension and therefore a strong, coordinated Union response is required. Financial support provided under this Regulation shall contribute in particular to strengthening national and Union capabilities in the security area. The Commission proposes to multiply EU funding for internal security by factor of 1.8 compared to the current period (2014-2020), so as to ensure a high level of security within the Union while strengthening the role of decentralised agencies in this area. The new internal security fund builds on the investments and achievements of its predecessor instruments: (i) the security and safeguarding liberties programme; (ii) the instrument for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management (ISF-P) and (iii) the drugs component of the Justice programme. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The proposed scope builds largely on the current Regulation for the Internal Security Fund-Police, while taking into account new policy developments, such as the European security agenda, the fight against terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime, and the new interoperability agenda. Objectives : the new enhanced fund shall contribute to a high level of security in the Union, in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime. Its specific objectives shall be to: increase the exchange of information among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant Union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; intensify cross-border joint operations among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities in relation to serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; support effort at strengthening the capabilities in relation to combating and preventing crime including terrorism in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the Member States. Actions funded shall be implemented in full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity. Actions limited to maintaining public order at national level shall not be eligible. Member State support : the allocation of the funding to the programmes of the Member States shall be based on a distribution key of three criteria: (i) the gross domestic product; (ii) size of the territory and; (iii) population of the state. It is proposed to weigh the different criteria as follows: 45% to inverse proportion to the gross domestic product, 40% to proportion to the size of population and 15% to proportion to the size of the territory of the Member State. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for projects with real European added value or to meet urgent needs and emergency funding to Member States. Coordination between EU policies : the enhanced ISF shall be coherent with and complementary to other Union financial programmes, notably the cohesion policy funds and Horizon Europe, as well as the Integrated Border Management Fund and the Asylum and Migration Fund. Furthermore, work under the internal security fund shall be consistent with that of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The Commission proposes to allocate an amount of EUR 1.12 billion (in current prices) to EU agencies in the field of security. The proposed Regulation does not cover the funding for these agencies. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 2.5 billion (in current prices) to the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The financial envelope shall be used as follows: EUR 1.5 billion allocated to Member States to enable them to build long-term resilience in the field of security; EUR 1 billion allocated to the thematic mechanism to address unforeseen security challenges and to enable a rapid response to emergency situations."
458,Macro-financial assistance to Jordan,"PURPOSE: to provide further macro-financial assistance (MFA) of EUR 500 million to Jordan. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Jordan relations are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Jordan signed an Association Agreement with the Union on 24 November 1997, which entered into force on 1 May 2002. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan. The Jordanian economy has been particularly affected by the conflict that has been raging in Syria since 2011. This regional unrest has caused a considerable deterioration in external revenues and strained public finances. They have affected tourism and foreign direct investment. Regardless of these conflicts, the supply of natural gas from Egypt has been disrupted for several years. In addition, the Jordanian economy has faced a massive influx of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on public finances, public services and infrastructure. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Union has made available more than EUR 2.1 billion to Jordan under different instruments (including EUR 380 million under the two aforementioned MFA programmes) to help the country preserve economic stability, sustain political and economic reform and address its related humanitarian, development and security needs. In addition, the European Investment Bank has allocated around EUR 486 million in project loans to Jordan. A recent evaluation of the implementation of MFA operations concluded that the first MFA programme was adapted to Jordan's economic challenges and in line with EU priorities. The evaluation also found that the programme had been implemented efficiently and in close coordination with the Jordanian authorities, had contributed to preserving macroeconomic stability and has had a positive social impact. In July 2019, given its still difficult economic situation and prospects, Jordan requested further macro-financial assistance from the Union. In this context, the Commission considers that the continued support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Jordan's international partners, of which the EU remains essential. CONTENT: the European Commission proposes to provide Jordan with additional macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 500 million in three instalments in the form of medium and long-term loans. The EU MFA is an exceptional emergency aid instrument designed to respond to serious balance of payments difficulties in third countries. The objective of the proposed MFA is to help Jordan cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2020-2021, reducing the economy’s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities as well as contributing to the debt sustainability. In addition, EU assistance would encourage Jordan to step up its reform efforts through a Memorandum of Understanding, to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities and shall include a package of measures to promote economic adjustment and the implementation of structural reforms. MFA funds shall be made available in the form of low-interest and long-term loans. Disbursements under the proposed programme shall be strictly conditional on the implementation of specific conditions, to be agreed between the EU and Jordan and set out in a Memorandum of Understanding. These conditions should be in line not only with the priorities of the EU-Jordan Partnership, as confirmed at the Brussels III Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region, held from 12 to 14 March 2019, and at the EU-Jordan Association Council on 17 July 2019, but also with the adjustment programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank."
8187,EU/Cuba Agreement: modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union,"The European Parliament adopted by 687 votes to 1, with 8 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Republic of Cuba pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The basis of this approach is that the existing volume of each TRQ would be fully maintained in the future but split across two separate customs territories: the EU27 and the UK. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows into the EU27 and the UK during a representative reference period for all WTO TRQs. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch GATT Article XXVIII negotiations with the WTO Members concerned with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO tariff quota concessions. The negotiations with Cuba resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 3 July 2020."
12487,Strengthening the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women,"PURPOSE: to establish minimum requirements to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women through pay transparency and enforcement mechanism. PURPOSE: to set up a European Partnership on Metrology jointly undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 2 and 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union enshrine the right to equality between women and men as one of the core values and tasks of the Union. The European pillar of social rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, includes among its principles equal treatment of women and men and the right to equal pay for work of equal value. Despite Directive 2006/54/EC, supplemented in 2014 by a Commission Recommendation on pay transparency, the effective implementation of the principle of equal pay remains problematic in practice in the EU. The gender pay gap in the EU remains at around 14%. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences on female workers make it even more urgent to address this issue. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for more action at EU level to improve the implementation of equal pay provisions. The Council has called on both the Member States and the Commission to act. Following the evaluation of the existing framework on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, the gender equality strategy 2020-2025 announced binding measures on pay transparency. CONTENT: the proposed directive aims to address the persistent inadequacy in the application of the fundamental right to equal pay and to ensure that this right is respected throughout the EU, by setting standards for pay transparency to enable workers to assert their right to equal pay. Member States could provide for a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive. Same work and work of equal value The proposal requires Member States to establish tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of work in line with a set of objective criteria which include educational, professional and training requirements, skills, effort and responsibility, work undertaken and the nature of the tasks involved. The availability of clear criteria at national level will help workers to establish a valid comparator and assess whether they are treated less favourably than the comparator performing the same work or work of equal value. Pay transparency The proposal: - requires employers to provide, prior to the job interview, information on the initial pay level or a corresponding range (based on objective and gender-neutral criteria) to be paid to the future worker in relation to a specific position or job. Employers would not have the right to ask applicants about their pay history in their former employment relationship; - requires employers to make available to workers a description of the gender-neutral criteria used to define their pay and career progression; - gives workers the right to ask their employer for information on their individual pay level and on average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work or work of equal value; - requires employers with at least 250 workers to make publicly accessible certain information, such as the pay gap between female and male workers in their organisation. On the basis of the information provided, employees and their representatives would have the right to ask the employer for clarification of this information; - obliges the employers concerned to carry out a pay assessment in cooperation with employee representatives where the pay information indicates a gender pay gap of at least 5%, which the employer cannot justify on the basis of objective and gender-neutral factors. Better access to justice for victims of pay discrimination With regard to redress and enforcement, the proposal: - requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to enforce the rights and obligations under the Directive; - introduces the right for equality bodies and workers’ representatives or other legal entities to act on behalf or in support of a worker, and for them to bring collective claims to court; - obliges Member States to ensure that any worker who is a victim of sex discrimination in pay can obtain full compensation for the harm caused; - increases the burden of proof on the employer: the employer, not the worker, should prove the absence of discrimination in relation to pay; - provides that the limitation period for bringing a claim under the proposed Directive should be at least three years; - requires Member States to establish specific penalties for infringements of the equal pay rule, including minimum fines."
8626,The Aarhus Regulation,"PURPOSE: to lay down detailed provisions to apply the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters to Community institutions and bodies. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union and its Member States are Parties to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention). Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Aarhus Regulation) established provisions to apply the provisions of the Convention to EU institutions and bodies. For the European Green Deal to be successful and bring about lasting change, the public - individuals but also civil society - should remain a driving force in the transition and be given the means to participate actively in the development and implementation of new policies. In its Communication on the European Green Deal, the Commission committed itself to revise the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ to improve access to administrative and judicial review at EU level for citizens and NGOs who have concerns about the legality of decisions affecting the environment and to take measures to improve their access to justice before the national courts in all Member States. In its resolution of 15 January 2020, the European Parliament reaffirmed that it is essential to ensure that EU citizens have genuine access to justice and documents as enshrined in the Aarhus Convention. CONTENT: the proposal aims to revise the administrative review created established in 2006 by the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ for the benefit of NGOs with regard to acts and omissions of an administrative nature by EU institutions and bodies. In concrete terms, the amending proposal: - extends the current possibilities for NGOs to request administrative review: whereas administrative review can currently only be requested for acts of 'individual scope' (which directly concern a person), in future NGOs may also request review of any non-legislative administrative act of 'general scope'; however, the proposal excludes provisions of such acts for which EU law explicitly requires implementing measures at EU or national level; - amends the references to environmental law by providing that, in future, any administrative act which contravenes EU environmental law may be subject to review, irrespective of its policy objectives; however, the proposal does not envisage granting standing for individuals; - extends the deadlines for the internal review procedure to allow for an appropriate quality of submissions, including a two-week extension for NGOs and a four-week extension for EU institutions. Budgetary implications The report and the external study on the functioning of access to justice in environmental matters accompanying the proposal assessed the impact of the different options on the internal resources of the EU institutions, in particular the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). They concluded that this impact shall be limited if the options introduced by the proposal are followed. The proposed amendments shall not create a new system and shall not lead to an increase in the number of potential applicants for review. Although the expanding of the eligibility requirements may lead to an increase in the current workload, this could be partially compensated by clearer eligibility criteria."
4506,"Introduction of capacity limits for Eastern Baltic cod, data collection and control measures in the Baltic Sea and permanent cessation for fleets fishing for Eastern Baltic cod","PURPOSE: to provide financial support to fishermen affected by the closure of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery to permanently decommission their fishing vessels. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Baltic Sea ecosystem has been fragile for decades. However, it was only in 2019 that the scientists warned about the impact of environmental conditions on Eastern Baltic cod. This situation is leading to a steep decline in this species and even in the total absence of fishing activities, the Eastern Baltic cod stock is not expected to recover until 2024. Therefore given the above situation, this year, acting upon the best available scientific advice and in accordance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and the Multiannual Plan for the Baltic Sea established by Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Commission adopted first emergency measures in July 2019 prohibiting the fishing of Eastern Baltic cod until year-end; and secondly, the Council decided in October 2019 on necessary and unprecedented fishing restrictions for 2020. Commission analysis shows that the fleet segments with the highest dependency on Eastern Baltic cod encompass more than 300 vessels, mainly trawlers and netters in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, and to a lesser extent Denmark. These fleet segments are of significant socioeconomic importance, representing between roughly 20% and 50% of the respective national fleet in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, expressed in full-time equivalents. Of these, only a minority seem resilient enough to survive a short-term – but not a medium or long-term – closure. The Commission has therefore concluded that urgent measures are needed in this sector. Support for the permanent cessation of activities through ship scrapping has been granted until the end of 2017 under the European Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Fund (EAMF) established by Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council. This proposal would reintroduce this measure, under new and strict conditions, for the Eastern Baltic cod fleet until the end of the current FEAMP period (2014-2020). CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulations (EU) 2016/1139 and (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides the following: Financial assistance of the EMFF The proposal aims to allow Member States affected by the exceptional situation of Eastern Baltic cod to grant financial support for achieving and maintaining a balance between the fleet capacity and the fishing opportunities by making financial support for permanent cessation of fishing activities through scrapping eligible under the EMFF 2014-2022. These Member States would have the possibility to redirect available appropriations for storage aid and Integrated Maritime Policy inside the financial envelope of each Member State to the permanent cessation of fishing activities with a view to reinforce the need to scrap vessels, while at the same time not negatively impacting the achievements of other CFP objectives and the implementation of the EMFF. Aid for the permanent cessation of fishing activities shall only be granted for the scrapping of fishing vessels. It shall not be granted for the retroffiting of fishing vessels for activities other than commercial fishing, such as recreational fishing, that have a detrimental impact on the ecosystem. Reduction capacity According to ICES advice, approximately 70% of the cod landings in subdivisions 24-28 were taken by trawlers with a BACOMA with a 120 mm escape window or T90, and 15% of the cod landings were taken by gillnetters with mesh sizes between 110 mm and 156 mm. Under this proposal, the Member State capacity level of these two fleet segments shall be capped at levels of active vessels in the most recent years before the application of emergency measures, i.e. 2017 and 2018, and shall be reduced when vessels are withdrawn with public aid, with the aim of rebuilding the stock of Eastern Baltic cod. Monitoring of cod catches Given the serious condition of the Eastern Baltic cod stock additional measures to control the fisheries catching Eastern Baltic cod should be introduced. The threshold quantity as of which a fishing vessel is required to land its catch in a specific place should be reduced to 250kg. Masters of fishing vessels having quotas for cod and fishing in areas where Eastern Baltic cod is present are to ensure that their fishing activity can be monitored at any time by the national competent authorities. From 2020 onwards, vessels fishing for cod in the Eastern Baltic shall be equipped with a satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS) or other equivalent electronic monitoring system. In order to improve data collection, the observer coverage shall reach at least 20% for vessels catching Eastern Baltic cod."
294,EU-Ukraine Agreement Amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement,"PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Ukraine amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, entered into force on 1 September 2017. A new type of poultry cut consists of a traditional breast cap with the humerus bones of the wings attached and can, after minimal transformation in the Union, be marketed in the Union as poultry breast. Unlimited imports of those cuts, of which imports from Ukraine reached 55 500 tons in 2018, therefore risk undermining the conditions under which traditional poultry breast cuts may be imported into the Union under the Association Agreement, in particular the quantitative restrictions in the form of a tariff rate quota. On 20 December 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Ukraine with a view to finding a solution by amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement. Those negotiations were successfully concluded on 19 March 2019. CONTENT: the purpose of the draft Council Decision is to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Ukraine amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part."
13086,Strengthening Europol’s mandate: entry of alerts in SIS,"PURPOSE: to establish a specific alert category issued by Europol in SIS in order to exchange information on persons who represent a threat to the internal security of the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: given the increasingly global nature of serious crime and terrorism brought about by growing mobility, the information that third countries and international organisations obtain about criminals and terrorists is increasingly relevant for the EU‘s security. Such information should contribute to the comprehensive efforts to ensure internal security in the European Union. Some of this information is only shared with Europol. While Europol holds valuable information received from external partners on serious criminals and terrorists, it cannot issue alerts in SIS. Member States are also not always able to issue alerts in SIS on the basis of such information. In order to bridge the gap in information sharing on serious crime and terrorism, in particular on foreign terrorist fighters – where the monitoring of their movement is crucial – it is necessary to ensure Europol is able to make this information available directly and in real-time to front-line officers in Member States. Europol should therefore be authorised to enter alerts in SIS, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules. To that end, the Commission proposes that a specific category of alert should be created in SIS, to be issued exclusively by Europol, in order to inform end-users carrying out a search in SIS that the person concerned is suspected of being involved in a criminal offence in respect of which Europol is competent, and in order for Europol to obtain confirmation that the person who is subject to the alert has been located. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: the present proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol. In particular, it widens the scope of application of the current SIS by introducing a new alert category for Europol. Specific provisions The proposal seeks to: - enable Europol to issue ‘information alerts’ on suspects and criminals as a new alert category in SIS, for exclusive use by Europol in specific and well-defined cases and circumstances. This is an important paradigm change for SIS, as until now, only Member States could enter, update and delete data in SIS and Europol had ‘read-only’ access covering all alert categories. Europol would be able to issue alerts on the basis of its analysis of third-country sourced information or information from international organisations, within the scope of crimes falling under Europol’s mandate and only on third-country nationals who are not beneficiaries of free movement rights. The purpose of the new alert category is that in case of a ‘hit’, the alert would inform the frontline officer that Europol holds information on the person; - set out detailed provisions on the procedural requirements that Europol is required to fulfil prior to entering an alert in SIS; - align the obligations and requirements of Europol when entering alerts in SIS with alert issuing Member States. These requirements concern: categories of data, proportionality, minimum data content for an alert to be entered, entering biometric data, general data processing rules, quality of the data in SIS as well as rules on distinguishing between persons with similar characteristics, misused identity and links. The frontline officer would be required to report immediately the occurrence of the ‘hit’ to the national SIRENE Bureau, which would in turn contact Europol. The frontline officer would only report that the person who is subject of an alert was located and would indicate the place, time and reason for the check carried out; - define the review period for alerts entered by Europol as well as the alert deletion rules which are specific to this type of alert. As a general rule, an alert should be kept only for the time that is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact, estimated at EUR 1 820 000 for the period 2021-2022, reflects the changes required for establishing this new alert category in Central SIS by eu-LISA, the EU Agency responsible for the management and development of Central SIS. The expenses related to the development of the national systems connected to Central SIS are to be covered by the resources available to the Member States under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 for the development and maintenance of SIS. The proposal would also require Europol to set up a technical interface for entering, updating and deleting data in Central SIS."
7408,EU/Norway Agreement: modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union,"The Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Jörgen WARBORN (EPP, SE) on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the Union and Norway relating to the modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the 143 EU agricultural, fish and industrial WTO tariff-rate quotas. The aim is to maintain the full existing volume of each tariff quota in the future, but to divide it between two separate customs territories: the EU-27 and the UK. The principle behind the applied methodology is based on trade flows to the EU-27 and the UK during a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. The negotiations with Norway resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 7-8 July 2020."
2324,Sustainable rail market in view of COVID-19 outbreak,"PURPOSE: to assist the railway sector deal with the emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant drop in demand which in turn has led to a sharp drop in rail transport. Demand for both passenger and freight services for the whole of 2020 is expected to be well below 2019 levels. The pandemic may lead to a large number of insolvencies and liquidity shortages within the railway sector. It affects all the supply chain and has effects on railway undertakings, shippers and logistic enterprises. Infrastructure managers and service facility operators will also suffer from its financial consequences. The rail sector makes a vital contribution to the European economy as a whole and to employment, directly employing more than 1 million people, of whom around 600 000 are employed in railway undertakings and 440 000 in infrastructure managers (by the end of 2016). Rail transport is also a key element of the EU's strategy to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, ensure economic and social cohesion and connecting Europeans within and between Member States. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a Single European Railway Area does not allow Member States, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, to respond to the unpredictable effects on rail transport by adapting, in particular, the rules on charging and capacity allocation. Targeted derogations should therefore be allowed in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on rail transport and to preserve the integrity of the single European railway area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation is intended to complete the existing rail-related framework in order to allow national authorities and rail stakeholders to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the urgent needs of the railway sector as long as those consequences persist. These temporary emergency measures concern notably the waiver, reduction or deferral of track access charges for the use of rail infrastructure, as well as the waiver of reservation charges. They cover a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, in respect of which charges may be altered, by derogation from Article 27 of Directive 2012/34/EU whereby the network statement (displaying all applicable charges) shall be published no less than for months in advance for the deadline for requests for infrastructure capacity. Income losses on the part of infrastructure managers as a result of the reductions envisaged in the proposed Regulation shall be reimbursed by Member States by 31 December of the year following the year in which the loss was incurred at the latest. The Commission may, by means of delegated acts, extend the time period during which the measures envisaged by the proposed Regulation apply."
13069,"Extension of the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of Galileo and GPS satellite-based navigation systems and related applications","PURPOSE: to renew the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of Galileo and GPS satellite navigation systems and related applications between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United States of America, of the other part. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite navigation systems and related applications between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United States of America, of the other part, was signed in 2004. It entered into force on 12 December 2011 for an initial period of ten years and expires on 12 December 2021. Both Parties have confirmed their intention to renew the agreement for a further period of five years, without any amendment to the Agreement. The Galileo and GPS systems are under further development and evolving. Continued cooperation between the two systems is necessary for a number of reasons, including to ensure compatibility and interoperability. Moreover, the United States is a privileged satellite navigation partner of the Union. It is in the interest of the EU to renew this Agreement in order to continue to further engage in satellite navigation cooperation with the U.S. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the renewal for a further period of five years of the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS satellite navigation systems and related applications between the United States of America, on the one hand, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other. The Agreement’s objective is to provide a framework for cooperation between the Parties in the promotion, provision and use of civil GPS and Galileo navigation and timing signals and services, value-added services, augmentations, and global navigation and timing goods. Moreover, the Parties intend to work together, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora, as provided herein, to promote and facilitate the use of these signals, services, and equipment for peaceful civil, commercial, and scientific uses, consistent with and in furtherance of mutual security interests. It should be noted that this proposed renewal of the Agreement (i) does not foresee conferring Galileo ownership or decision-making rights to the U.S; (ii) does not give the U.S. the right to participate in the EU GNSS-related Programme Committees or Working Groups; (iii) does not allow the U.S. to participate in Galileo PRS (Public Regulated Service) relevant fora, working groups or discussions."
2836,European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee,"PURPOSE: to enable a maximum use of funds to address the effects of the unprecedented public health crisis resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has consequences for migration, security and border management in the Member States. It requires that measures be taken to support Member States in the implementation of funds by strengthening the possibility to make full use of the available implementation period until the closure of the programmes on 31 December 2023. In this respect, it is appropriate to ensure that the N+2 rule is fully used so as to provide Member States sufficient time for the implementation of their allocations and declaration of the expenditure to the Commission. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council aligns the deadlines for payment requests and decommitment and it adjusts the date of commitment of the additional allocations in 2018 and 2019, which have been granted to address unforeseen needs in the areas covered by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Funds and the Internal Security Fund. The proposed amendment aims to ensure that: - all payment requests covering the year N+2 submitted by Member State within the regulatory deadlines set out in Art. 44 of Regulation 514/2014 are taken into account when calculating the decommitment; - the implementation period of the amounts corresponding to additional allocations to the national programmes provided in 2018 and 2019 is aligned with the implementation period of the initial allocation."
9264,EU/Indonesia Agreement: modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union,"The European Parliament adopted by 685 votes to 3, with 6 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Republic of Indonesia pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU28 WTO schedule for the 143 EU agricultural, fish and industrial WTO tariff-rate quotas (TRQs). The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows into the EU27 and the UK during a representative reference period (of 3 years from 2013 to 2015) for all WTO TRQs. The agreed allocation method is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The principle behind the methodology applied is based on trade flows in the EU-27 and the UK over a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff quotas. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch GATT Article XXVIII negotiations with the relevant WTO Members with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO tariff quota concessions. Negotiations with Indonesia resulted in an agreement which was initialled on 28 January 2021 in Geneva."
12502,Equivalence of field inspections and of certain seed produced in Bolivia,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Decision 2003/17/EC as regards its period of application and to add Bolivia to the list of third countries for which field inspections of seed producing crops and seed produced in those countries are considered equivalent to EU field inspections and seed production, respectively, in respect of sorghum, maize and sunflower. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that, under certain conditions, field inspections carried out in the third countries listed in its Annex I on certain seed-producing crops are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that, under certain conditions, seed of certain cereal species produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law. Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022. On 29 January 2016, Bolivia submitted a request to the Commission to consider seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia as offering the same assurances as regards identity, health and quality as seed produced in the EU on the basis of official controls carried out by the competent authorities of that country. Following this request, the Commission assessed the relevant Bolivian legislation and carried out an audit of the Bolivian seed production and certification system. The Commission identified shortcomings and made recommendations to Bolivia. As Bolivia addressed these shortcomings by 30 November 2018, the Commission recognised that the Bolivian system in place offered the same assurance as the EU system. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to grant equivalence in respect of field inspections of seed producing crops of sorghum, maize and sunflower carried out in Bolivia and in respect of seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia and officially certified by its authorities. As Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022, it is proposed to extend by 7 years (until 31 December 2029) the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision, in order to avoid any risk of disruption of seed imports into the Union. The proposal will stimulate seed trade between Bolivia and the EU. Granting the EU equivalence would therefore contribute to the maintenance of the continuous supply of high quality seed in the EU. It could also make it more attractive for EU-based companies to invest in the agricultural development of Bolivia given that the EU would become an export market."
5152,Elimination of customs duties on certain products,"PURPOSE: to eliminate customs duties on certain imports into the European Union with a view to consolidating the partnership between the European Union and the United States. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the US have a close trade and investment relationship. Bilateral trade in goods and services between them amounts to more than EUR 1000 billion per year, or EUR 3 billion per day. On 21 August 2020 Commissioner Hogan and US Trade Representative Lighthizer stated their intention to go ahead with a trade-facilitating package to eliminate or reduce customs duties for a small number of tariff lines covering EUR 168 million (approximatively USD 200 million) in EU and US exports. The Commission therefore proposes to create additional opportunities for EU and US operators by eliminating or reducing tariffs. It sees this initiative as a first step to de-escalate bilateral trade tensions and to support the settlement of on-going disputes. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to eliminate a number of customs tariffs on lobster. Lobster is not sensitive products for the EU, which is a net importer of these products. EU producers supply less than 5% of European consumption. The elimination of import duties shall support the food-processing industry and the hospitality sector. In return, the US has committed to ease market access for EU27 exports worth EUR 143 million (USD 160 million) on average in the past three years, through a 50% reduction of duties. These include products such as prepared meals, certain crystal glassware, surface preparations, propellant powders, cigarette lighters and lighter parts. The US requested the tariff reduction for lobster in light of its declining exports of the product to Europe and the world. The tariff reductions should be implemented in a fully WTO consistent manner and respect the most-favoured nation (MFN) principle. The measures shall apply retroactively as of 1 August 2020 and end on 31 July 2025. The agreement shall have a limited negative impact on the budget of the EU in the form of foregone customs duties due to tariff liberalisation for the products covered by the tariff lines in annex to this Regulation, representing some EUR 5.3 million in duties collected from the US (average 2017-2019 period)."
1452,Conclusion of the EU-China Civil Aviation Safety Agreement,"PURPOSE: to conclude an agreement on civil aviation safety between the European Union and the Government of the People's Republic of China. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on civil aviation safety between the European Union and the Government of the People's Republic of China negotiated by the Commission was signed on 20 March 2019, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Agreement now needs to be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision is aimed at approving, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement on civil aviation safety between the European Union and China. The Agreement is based on mutual confidence as regards systems and on the comparison of regulatory differences. The objectives of this Agreement are to: - enable the reciprocal acceptance, as provided for in the Annexes to this Agreement, of findings of compliance and certificates issued by either Party's Competent Authorities; - facilitate the multinational dimension of the civil aviation industry; - facilitate and promote the free circulation of civil aeronautical products and services; - promote cooperation in order to achieve a high level of civil aviation safety and environmental compatibility. The scope of cooperation under this Agreement includes the following areas: - the airworthiness Certificates and Monitoring of Civil Aeronautical Products; - environmental testing and Certificates of Civil Aeronautical Products; - the certification and Monitoring of design and production organisations; - the certification and Monitoring of maintenance organisations; - personnel licensing and training; - operation of aircraft; - air traffic services and air traffic management. The Commission shall be authorised to approve, on behalf of the Union, amendments to the Annexes to the Agreement adopted by the Joint Committee in so far as such amendments are consistent with, and do not entail any modification of, relevant Union legal acts. It shall in particular ensure that the approval on behalf of the Union: (i) is in the interests of the Union; (ii) serves the objectives pursued by the Union within the framework of its aviation safety and trade policy; (iii) takes into account the interests of the manufacturers, traders and consumers of the Union. In order to ensure that the approval by the Commission of proposed amendments to the Annexes to the Agreement to be adopted by the Joint Committee is in conformity with the conditions laid down in this Decision, the Commission shall submit the proposed amendments to the Council for consultation sufficiently in advance of the Joint Committee meeting at which those amendments would be adopted. The conformity of the amendments submitted by the Commission to the Council should be assessed by the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States (Coreper)."
8189,Protocol to the EU/Central America Association Agreement (accession of Croatia),"PURPOSE: to conclude a Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Central America, of the other part, to take account of the accession of Croatia to the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if the European Parliament has given its consent. BACKGROUND: the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Central America, of the other part, was signed on 29 June 2012 and has not yet fully entered into force, as some Member States have yet to ratify it. In accordance with the Act of Accession of Croatia, Croatia has undertaken to accede to the existing agreements concluded or signed by the Member States and the European Union with third countries by means of protocols concluded by the Council, acting unanimously on behalf of the Member States, with the third countries concerned. The text of the Protocol to the Association Agreement, which takes into account the accession of Croatia to the European Union, was finalised by both parties on 27 June 2019 in the framework of the Association Committee meeting. CONTENT: the Council's draft aims to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Central America, of the other part, to take account of the accession of Croatia to the European Union. Through the proposed Protocol, Croatia would be integrated into the Association Agreement with Central America as a party to the Agreement."
12524,Increased pre-financing from REACT-EU,"PURPOSE: to provide for an increased amount of pre-financing to be paid under REACT-EU, which is needed to help Member States meet the challenges posed by the exceptionally high number of people fleeing the war in Ukraine and to support their transition to a resilient economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the recent military aggression by Russia against Ukraine, the European Union and in particular its eastern regions are facing a massive influx of people. This poses an additional challenge for public budgets at a time when Member States’ economies are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and risks undermining the preparation of a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy. Member States are already able to finance a broad range of investments to address migratory challenges under their operational programmes with support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), including from the additional resources made available as Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). The Commission has already taken steps to assist Member States in this regard, through its ‘Cohesion Action for Refugees in Europe’ (CARE) initiative of 8 March 2022. Notwithstanding the room for manoeuvre offered by the CARE package, Member States face additional immediate budgetary pressures arising from the management of mass arrivals of people fleeing Ukraine. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. The Commission therefore considers it necessary, as a temporary and exceptional measure, to increase the amount of pre-financing paid under REACT-EU for all Member States. BACKGROUND: this proposal provides for exceptional and targeted changes to the 2014-2020 legal framework established for the European Structural and Investment Funds and for the Fund for the European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in response to the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the subsequent impact on the European Union and several of its eastern regions in particular. It is proposed to amend Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 and (EU) No 223/2014 in order to provide for an increased percentage of pre-financing to be paid under REACT-EU, which is necessary to respond to this unprecedented situation. In addition to the initial pre-financing, the Commission will pay 4% of the REACT-EU resources allocated to programmes for the year 2021 as additional initial pre-financing in 2022. For programmes in Member States which have had a level of arrivals of persons from Ukraine greater than 1% of their national population between 24 February 2022 and 23 March 2022, that percentage shall be increased to 34%. In order to monitor the use of this additional pre-financing, the final reports on the implementation of ERDF and ESF programmes benefiting from such pre-financing should include information on how the additional amounts received have been used to address the migration challenges linked to Russia's military aggression and have contributed to the recovery of the economy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal only concerns REACT-EU, which is financed by the European Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU. The additional initial pre-financing payments in 2022 will be financed from external assigned revenues. All amounts will be available as external assigned revenues, within the meaning of the Financial Regulation stemming from the Next GenerationEU borrowing operations. The amount paid as additional initial pre-financing will be totally cleared from the Commission accounts not later than when the operational programme is closed, such that the total amount of payments made under REACT-EU will remain unchanged with this proposal. Similarly, the total commitment appropriations under REACT-EU will not be modified."
9256,Conservation and enforcement measures applicable in the Regulatory Area of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO),"PURPOSE: to transpose into Union law the amendments to the conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) at its last annual meeting in 2019. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/833 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) has adopted, at its 41st annual meeting, a number of legally binding decisions for the conservation of the fishery resources under its purview. The EU has been a Contracting Party to NAFO since 1979. The NAFO Convention states that the conservation measures adopted by the NAFO Commission are binding and that the contracting parties are required to implement them. Regulation (EU) 2019/833 turned into Union law the NAFO conservation and enforcement measures. This proposal covers most the recent amendments adopted by NAFO. These amendments entered into force for the Union on 2 December 2019 and apply from that date. As far as the Union is concerned, they are to be incorporated into Union law to the extent that they are not already covered by Union law. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/833 by including the most recent amendments to the Conservation and Enforcement Measures adopted at the NAFO annual meeting in September 2019. These amendments are binding on the Contracting Parties. The proposal: - adapts Regulation (EU) 2019/833 in order to apply the NAFO mesh size measurement standards, to introduce the definition of fishing vessel used by NAFO to allow EU control and enforcement authorities to work in agreement with other NAFO Contracting Parties; - includes NAFO’s editorial changes to a few provisions concerning Greenland halibut, production logbook, cross-references to infringements and infringement procedures. It introduces definitions and reference to the NAFO monitoring, control and surveillance website together with the relevant protocol for granting access to this website; - improves the information flow between the Member States fisheries authorities, the Commission and the NAFO Secretariat and acknowledges the role of the European Fisheries Control Agency in coordinating the inspection means deployed within the NAFO Joint Inspection and Surveillance Scheme; - introduces provisions to protect the Greenland shark; - clarifies the need for the consent of the port State Contracting Party to be given to inspectors of another Contracting Party as well as the chartering arrangements that should apply at NAFO level; - delegates to the Commission powers to amend the NAFO conservation and enforcement provisions on mesh sizes, sorting grids or grates and toggle chains in the Northern prawn fishing, and area restrictions for the bottom fishing activities."
9257,Cross-border payments in the Union (codification),"PURPOSE: to establish rules on cross-border payments and the transparency of currency conversion charges within the Union (codification of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community, which has been amended several times and quite substantially. The new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bringing them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the following: Charges for cross-border payments in euro According to the proposal, charges levied by a payment service provider on a payment service user in respect of cross-border payments in euro shall be the same as the charges levied by that payment service provider for corresponding national payments of the same value in the national currency of the Member State in which the payment service provider of the payment service user is located. In order to facilitate the functioning of the Internal Market, the proposal lays down the principle that payment service providers shall align the charges they levy for cross-border payments in euro with the charges they levy for comparable national payments made in the national currency of the Member State in which they are established, including where the euro is not the national currency of that Member State. Transparency obligations The proposal sets out transparency requirements relating to currency conversion practices. It therefore provides that consumers shall be fully informed of the amount of exchange charges before making a cross-border payment (for example, when using their card abroad, be it a cash withdrawal from an ATM or to pay by card at the point of sale). To allow comparability, currency conversion charges for all card payments shall be expressed in the same way, namely as percentage mark-ups over the latest available euro foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). These mark-ups shall be communicated to the payer prior to the initiation of the payment transaction. In order to facilitate the automation of payments, banks shall, where appropriate: (i) communicate to the user the user's International Payment Account Number Identifier (IBAN) and the bank's Business Identifier Code (BIC); (ii) indicate on the statement of accounts or in an annex to the statements, the user's IBAN and the bank's BIC. Compliance with obligations The proposal obliges Member States to provide for complaint procedures for alleged infringements of this Regulation, as well as effective out-of-court redress procedures for the settlement of disputes. Penalties may be imposed for infringements."
767,EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement,"PURPOSE: to conclude the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Vietnam, on the other. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In December 2009, the Council agreed on the principle of launching bilateral negotiations with individual ASEAN countries based on the authorisation and negotiating directives of 2007, whilst preserving the strategic objective of a region-to-region agreement. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007 and supplemented in October 2013 to include investment protection, the Commission negotiated with Vietnam an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. Vietnam is a vibrant economy of more than 90 million inhabitants, with the fastest growing middle class in ASEAN, and a young and dynamic workforce. With its high literacy rate and education levels, comparatively low wages, good connectivity and a central location within ASEAN, more and more foreign investors are choosing Vietnam as their hub to service the Mekong region and beyond. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Vietnam, on the other. The agreement, signed subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. The EU-Vietnam IPA will ensure a high level of investment protection, while safeguarding the EU’s and Vietnam’s rights to regulate and pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as the protection of public health, safety and the environment."
1016,Temporary measures concerning the validity of certificates and licences (omnibus),"PURPOSE: to extend the time limits laid down in Union law for the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations, and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in certain areas of transport legislation in the context of COVID 19. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that affect normal activity of the competent authorities in the Member States and the work of transport undertakings as regards the administrative formalities to be completed in different transport sectors that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of the relevant measures. Those extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on various areas covered by Union transport law. In particular, transport operators and other persons concerned may not be able to complete the necessary formalities or procedures to comply with certain provisions of Union law related to the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations or to complete other steps necessary to maintain their validity. This is the case, for instance, with driving licences, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers, Community licences and driver attestations for the provisions of road haulage services, rail single safety certificates or authorisations, boatmasters’ certificates or port security assessments etc. It is most likely that those certificates, licences, authorisations which, in accordance with Union law, would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 could not be renewed in due time. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt temporary provisions extending the validity of those certificates, licences or authorisations that would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and ensure that they remain valid during a reasonable period of time during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down specific and temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in response to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the area of road, rail and inland waterways transport and maritime security. This proposal concerns specific provisions that affect the application of several Directives and Regulations:  Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which (lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses with the objective to ensure safety on European roads). Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (provides for the mutual recognition of the driving licences issued by Member States based on a Union model driving licence). Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (defines the harmonised minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness testing). Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator). Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lay down common rules for access to the international road haulage market and the international market for coach and bus services, respectively). Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/798 (regulate safety certification and authorisation in the Union). Directive 2007/59/EC of the European Parliament (lays down rules on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union). Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (establishes a single European railway area). Directive 96/50/EC (lays down conditions for obtaining boatmasters’ certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union). Directive (EU) 2016/1629 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels). Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down rules on ship and port facility security). Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down measures to enhance port security in the face of threats of security incidents). This Regulation should be adopted as a matter of urgency, so that situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors, in particular where the relevant time limits have already expired, remain as short as possible."
12416,Status Agreement between the EU and Moldova on Frontex operational activities,"The European Parliament adopted by 543 votes to 34, with 10 abstentions, a legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on operational activities carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in the Republic of Moldova. Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As of 11 March 2022, over 310 000 refugees had entered the Republic of Moldova from Ukraine following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In just the first two weeks of the war, more than two million refugees – around 4% of Ukraine’s population – mainly fled westward from the encroaching Russian forces. Moldovan border management authorities are thus now facing the twin challenges of regulating the influx and subsequent outflow of potentially hundreds of thousands of refugees, including monitoring the smuggling of weapons. Furthermore, some 12% of the territory of the country is not under the control of Moldovan authorities, including a large portion of Moldova’s border with Ukraine. On 14 March 2022, the Council adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Moldova as regards actions by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency on the territory of Moldova. On 17 March 2021, on the basis of a written procedure, delegations confirmed their agreement on the proposal for a Council Decision on the signature of the Status Agreement with Moldova. The Agreement was signed the same day, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The aim of the agreement is to allow the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to deploy border management teams from the permanent contingent to Moldova. The agreement regulates all aspects necessary for the deployment of the Border Management Teams from the European Border and Coast Guard Standing Corps in the Republic of Moldova, where the members of the teams may exercise executive powers. A status agreement will allow Frontex to assist Moldova in border management, by deploying teams capable of assisting the Moldovan authorities in tasks such as registration and border checks."
1050,International road passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions: cabotage operations between Italy and Switzerland,"PURPOSE: to empower Italy to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the course of international road passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between the two countries. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the two-way carriage of passengers and goods by road between Switzerland and the EU is regulated by the Land Transport Agreement between the EU and Switzerland ('EU Agreement'). Under the EU Agreement, the transport of passengers by coach and bus between two points situated on the territory of the same Contracting Party by carriers established in the territory of the other Contracting Party, known as cabotage, is not authorised. This means that the carriers operating the passenger services which cross the border can only carry passengers across the border or within the territory of the Contracting Party they are established in. Bus and coach operators established in Switzerland may not carry passengers between two points on the German side of the border and operators established in the EU may not carry passengers between two points on the Swiss side of the border. However, Article 20(2) of the EU Agreement specifically allows pre-existing rights under bilateral agreements concluded between individual EU Member States and Switzerland that were in force at the time of conclusion of the EU Agreement to continue to be exercised. The border regions of Italy and Switzerland are closely integrated. Many Italians commute to work in Switzerland and vice versa and there is vibrant cross-border passenger traffic by road. A number of bus and coach services are offered which cross the border and thus connect the border regions of the two countries. By letter dated 7 February 2018, Italy informed the Commission that it would like to negotiate and conclude an agreement with Switzerland which authorises cabotage operations during the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between the two countries. Switzerland informed the Commission that it was also interested in concluding such an agreement. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to empower Italy to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the respective border regions of Italy and Switzerland in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between the two countries, provided that there is no discrimination between carriers established in the Union and no distortion of competition. Cabotage operations allow increasing the load factor of the vehicles which increases the economic efficiency of the services. The authorisation of cabotage operations in the context of the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between Italy and Switzerland would allow the carriers involved to become more competitive and efficient. This could further strengthen the close integration of these border regions. In order to ensure that the cabotage operations concerned do not excessively alter the functioning of the internal market for coach and bus services, as established by Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, their authorisation should be subject to the conditions that there is no discrimination between carriers established within the Union and no distortion of competition. For the same reason, cabotage operations should only be authorised in the border regions of Italy in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between Italy and Switzerland. As border regions of Italy shall be considered the regions Piedmont and Lombardy and the autonomous regions Valle d'Aosta and TrentinoAlto Adige. This proposal is based on a request by Germany and concerns only this Member State. A similar request has been received by Italy which is subject to a parallel procedure."
10603,"Amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol","PURPOSE: to establish a specific alert category issued by Europol in SIS in order to exchange information on persons who represent a threat to the internal security of the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: given the increasingly global nature of serious crime and terrorism brought about by growing mobility, the information that third countries and international organisations obtain about criminals and terrorists is increasingly relevant for the EU‘s security. Such information should contribute to the comprehensive efforts to ensure internal security in the European Union. Some of this information is only shared with Europol. While Europol holds valuable information received from external partners on serious criminals and terrorists, it cannot issue alerts in SIS. Member States are also not always able to issue alerts in SIS on the basis of such information. In order to bridge the gap in information sharing on serious crime and terrorism, in particular on foreign terrorist fighters – where the monitoring of their movement is crucial – it is necessary to ensure Europol is able to make this information available directly and in real-time to front-line officers in Member States. Europol should therefore be authorised to enter alerts in SIS, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules. To that end, the Commission proposes that a specific category of alert should be created in SIS, to be issued exclusively by Europol, in order to inform end-users carrying out a search in SIS that the person concerned is suspected of being involved in a criminal offence in respect of which Europol is competent, and in order for Europol to obtain confirmation that the person who is subject to the alert has been located. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: the present proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol. In particular, it widens the scope of application of the current SIS by introducing a new alert category for Europol. Specific provisions The proposal seeks to: - enable Europol to issue ‘information alerts’ on suspects and criminals as a new alert category in SIS, for exclusive use by Europol in specific and well-defined cases and circumstances. This is an important paradigm change for SIS, as until now, only Member States could enter, update and delete data in SIS and Europol had ‘read-only’ access covering all alert categories. Europol would be able to issue alerts on the basis of its analysis of third-country sourced information or information from international organisations, within the scope of crimes falling under Europol’s mandate and only on third-country nationals who are not beneficiaries of free movement rights. The purpose of the new alert category is that in case of a ‘hit’, the alert would inform the frontline officer that Europol holds information on the person; - set out detailed provisions on the procedural requirements that Europol is required to fulfil prior to entering an alert in SIS; - align the obligations and requirements of Europol when entering alerts in SIS with alert issuing Member States. These requirements concern: categories of data, proportionality, minimum data content for an alert to be entered, entering biometric data, general data processing rules, quality of the data in SIS as well as rules on distinguishing between persons with similar characteristics, misused identity and links. The frontline officer would be required to report immediately the occurrence of the ‘hit’ to the national SIRENE Bureau, which would in turn contact Europol. The frontline officer would only report that the person who is subject of an alert was located and would indicate the place, time and reason for the check carried out; - define the review period for alerts entered by Europol as well as the alert deletion rules which are specific to this type of alert. As a general rule, an alert should be kept only for the time that is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact, estimated at EUR 1 820 000 for the period 2021-2022, reflects the changes required for establishing this new alert category in Central SIS by eu-LISA, the EU Agency responsible for the management and development of Central SIS. The expenses related to the development of the national systems connected to Central SIS are to be covered by the resources available to the Member States under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 for the development and maintenance of SIS. The proposal would also require Europol to set up a technical interface for entering, updating and deleting data in Central SIS."
10921,EU-US air transport agreement,"PURPOSE: conclusion of the Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United States of America, of the other part. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement represented a significant change in transatlantic aviation relations, providing broad new commercial freedoms for airlines and a comprehensive framework for regulatory cooperation with the United States on a wide range of issues. The 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement created substantial benefits for airlines, airports and air transport users in Europe. However, the EU was seeking additional investment and market access opportunities. Therefore, Article 21 of the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement established a non-exhaustive list of 'items of priority interest' for the second stage negotiations, including additional investment and market access opportunities, as well as environmental issues. After eight rounds of second stage negotiations, agreement was reached on 25 March 2010 on a draft Protocol to Amend the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement. The Protocol aims at: launching a process towards additional foreign investment opportunities in the airline industry, further opening market access, including further access by EU airlines to US Government-financed air transportation, and further strengthening the regulatory cooperation in all fields of aviation policy, particularly on addressing the environmental impact of aviation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Protocol further increases the benefits for consumers, airlines, labour, and communities in the Union: (1) in a study carried out for the Commission, the economic benefits of a fully Open Aviation Area between the EU and the United States have been estimated at several billion Euros per year; (2) another study estimates that further regulatory convergence in the field of air transport could significantly reduce costs for the industry. The same study concluded that the second stage negotiations have the potential to change the structure of the market in the EU and in the US, increasing profitability in the airline industry; (3) the inclusion of an article on the social dimension ensures that the further market opening will be accompanied by high labour standards and that labour-related rights will not be undermined by the new opportunities created by the Protocol; (4) lastly, the Protocol includes firm commitments from both Parties to limit or reduce the impact of international aviation on the environment. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2) and (5), as well Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reasons: (i) an amendment of an international treaty at Union level can only be done at Union level; (ii) the objectives of the Protocol can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. CONTENT: the Protocol amends the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement with the following provisions: a legal obligation to reciprocally recognise the regulatory determinations of the other Party with regard to airline fitness and citizenship; an enhanced cooperation to limit the impact of international aviation on the environment. The cooperation on addressing the environmental impacts of international aviation will include the areas of research and development, air traffic management innovation, coordination in international fora; an explicit recognition of the importance of the social dimension and the benefits of high labour standards as well as an enhanced cooperation on the social effects of the agreement; a strengthened role of the Joint Committee, enabling it to address incompatible regulatory approaches, allow for reciprocal recognition of decision-making, and promote cooperation across a number of additional fields, including air traffic management, facilitation, safety and cooperation with other countries; a process towards further market access and investment opportunities. Both sides commit to continuing to remove market access barriers. The Joint Committee will regularly review progress in that respect. Both sides will establish a process of cooperation in the Joint Committee towards the shared goal of removing market access barriers; further access of EU airlines to air transport funded by the US Government that is restricted currently to US airlines (""Fly America""). EU airlines will be able to sell air transportation to contractors of the US Government on any route, with exception of transport financed by the US Department of Defence. The Protocol is accompanied by a Memorandum of Consultations that includes additional new elements, in order to further enhance the existing cooperation in the areas of aviation security, competition policy, and the joint efforts to address the environmental impact of international aviation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."
2122,"European citizens’ initiative: temporary measures concerning the time limits for the collection, verification and exAmendmentination stages in view of the COVID-19 outbreak","PURPOSE: to lay down temporary measures concerning the time limits for the collection, verification and examination stages provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/788 on the European citizens' initiative in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Member States have been affected in a dramatic and exceptional way by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of restrictive measures were taken to stop or slow down the transmission of COVID-19, including lockdown measures to restrict the free movement of their citizens, the prohibition of public events, and the closure of shops, restaurants and schools. These measures have inevitably also had a serious impact on European citizens’ initiatives (ECIs), a participative democracy instrument that depends on the engagement of citizens across the EU. The national confinement measures and more generally the omnipresence of the pandemic make it currently nearly impossible for organisers to successfully continue their local campaigning activities and the collection of paper statements of support to help them gather the required statements within the set period of 12 months. Member States and the European institutions have also certain obligations as regards the verification (including certification) of the validity of the collected statements of support and the examination of a successful initiative. These obligations are equally time-bound. Due to the exceptional circumstances, these obligations may not be able to be respected within the set legal time limits. CONTENT: this proposal lays down temporary measures concerning the time limits for the collection, verification and examination stages provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/788 on the European citizens' initiative in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. Collection period In order to preserve the efficacy of the European citizens’ initiative instrument during this pandemic and to provide reassurance and legal clarity to organisers of initiatives the collection, verification or examination of which is ongoing, the Commission proposes to adopt temporary measures to extend by 6 months the current 12-month period for initiatives whose signature collection was ongoing on 11 March 2020, the date on which the COVID-19 epidemic was qualified as a pandemic by the WHO. That extension is based on the assumption that at least in the first six months since 11 March 2020 a majority of Member States or a number of Member States representing more than 35% of the Union population will have measures in place that will substantially hamper the organisers’ possibilities to carry out local campaigning and collect paper statements of support. Where the collection period of an initiative started after 11 March, that period should be extended proportionately. Verification period Similar temporary measures should be taken to allow Member States to request the European Commission for an extension of the verification period in case their competent authorities due to the measures taken to combat the pandemic cannot complete the verification in time. The measures are temporary in nature, as these only apply until end 2022. Examination period The examination period is also subject to specific time limits. The European institutions are required to organise a meeting with the organisers (to be organised by the Commission within one month after submission of a successful initiative) and a public hearing (to be organised by the European Parliament within three months after submission). The organisation of such events may be difficult within the time limits set by Regulation (EU) 2019/788. In such a case, the European institutions should be allowed to organise such events as soon as the public health situation in that country again allows for organising such events. In such cases, the European Commission shall adopt its Communication in response to a valid initiative within three months after the public hearing in the European Parliament. Lastly, this proposed Regulation should be adopted as a matter of urgency, so that situations of legal uncertainty affecting citizens, organisers, national administrations and the Union institutions, in particular where the relevant time periods for the collection of statements of support, verification and examination in respect of a number of initiatives have already ended or are about to end, remain as short as possible. It should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."
12870,"Strengthening Europol’s mandate: cooperation with private parties, processing of personal data, and support for research and innovation","PURPOSE: to strengthen Europol’s mandate to support Member States in preventing and combatting serious crime and terrorism. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU faces a security landscape in flux, with evolving and increasingly complex security threats. Criminals and terrorists exploit the advantages that the digital transformation and new technologies bring about, including the inter-connectivity and blurring of the boundaries between the physical and digital world. The COVID-19 crisis has added to this, as criminals have quickly seized opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modes of operation or developing new criminal activities. These threats spread across borders and manifest themselves in poly-criminal organised crime groups that engage in a wide range of criminal activities. As action at national level alone does not suffice to address these transnational security challenges, therefore the Commission proposes to enhance Europol’s mandate in order to give further support to Member States’ law enforcement authorities. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: this proposal aims to support and strengthen action by the Member States’ law enforcement services and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy. Specific provisions of the new mandate The new mandate should: - ensure effective cooperation between Europol and private parties: terrorists often abuse the services provided by private companies to recruit volunteers, to carry out terrorist attacks and to disseminate their propaganda. The revised mandate would allow private parties to refer such information directly to Europol. The Agency would be able to receive personal data directly from private parties and analyse it to identify all Member States concerned; request personal data from private parties (via the Member State where it is located); and act as a channel for Member States' requests to private parties, in compliance with data protection requirements; - enable Europol to exchange personal data with private parties related to crisis response: the proposal sets out rules for Europol to support Member States in preventing the large scale dissemination, via online platforms, of terrorist content related to on-going or recent real-world events depicting harm to life or physical integrity. Europol would be able to exchange personal data with private parties, including hashes, IP addresses or URLs related to such content; - allow Europol to analyse large datasets (‘big data') to support criminal investigations, considering that the processing of large data sets is an integral part of police work in today's digital world; - improve Europol's cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, including through analytical support to the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and information exchange, and with the European Anti-Fraud Office; - reinforce Europol's role in developing new technologies for law enforcement, helping to equip national law enforcement authorities with modern technologies to counter serious crime and terrorism; - strengthen Europol's data protection framework, accountability and democratic oversight, including by introducing new reporting obligations for Europol to the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group in charge of monitoring its activities. Budgetary implications The proposal would have an impact on the budget and staff needs of Europol. It is estimated that an additional budget of around EUR 180 million and around 160 additional posts would be needed for the overall MFF period to ensure that Europol has the necessary resources to enforce its revised mandate. This increase in staff and budget would give Europol the means to fulfil its strengthened mandate. It would provide the European Counter Terrorism Centre with adequate resources and to enable its EU Internet Referral Unit to monitor and refer all types of terrorist content to online platforms with a 24/7 availability. The revision of Europol's mandate also opens the possibility for Member States to contribute directly to Europol's budget, where necessary and required by existing or new tasks."
466,CAP: Financial discipline as from financial year 2021 and flexibility between pillars in respect of calendar year 2020,"PURPOSE: to ensure certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers in the year 2020 and ensuring the respect of budgetary ceilings for the EAGF by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in relation to the financing of the CAP, certain amendments of Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Horizontal Regulation) are needed to ensure that the financial discipline mechanism that makes it possible to respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation on the multi-annual financial framework can still operate for financial years post 2020. In relation to Direct Payments, Regulation (EU) 2019/288 amended Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy (Direct Payments Regulation) to extend the flexibility between pillars foreseen for calendar years 2015-2019 to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. This regulation sets up the amounts to transfer from the rural development to direct payments envelope as a percentage of the amount allocated to support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021 by Union legislation adopted after the adoption by the Council of the relevant Regulation pursuant to Article 312(2) TFEU. The relevant Union legislation may not be in place by the time the Member States need to notify their decision to transfer. To make it possible to apply the flexibility from rural development to direct payments, it is appropriate to establish the maximum amount that can be transferred based on a fixed amount and not a percentage. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulations (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council aims to ensure the continuity of certain elements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a transitional period of one year from 2014-2020 until the rules on CAP strategic plans are applied, in line with the Commission's proposal on support for CAP strategic plans. Update of the reference for determining a financial discipline rate Expenditure under the EAGF within a given financial year shall respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For that purpose, the said Regulation provides for the determination of a financial discipline adjustment rate. However, currently the relevant provisions refer to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 which only sets the relevant ceilings for the period 2014-2020. To ensure that the ceiling for the financing of market related expenditure and direct payments post 2020 will also be respected, the legal reference of Articles 16 and 26 should be amended to include the regulation to be adopted by the Council for financial year 2021 onwards. Change of the basis for notifying the transfer from rural development to direct payments To ensure continuity in the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between the two pillars, already decided by the colegislators in Regulation (EU) 2019/288, the Commission proposed to replace the percentage of transfer by maximum absolute amounts based on the current maximum percentages. Member States had the possibility to review by 1 August 2019 the percentage of their national ceiling for direct payments, which they want to allocate to Voluntary Coupled Support (VCS), as well as their detailed support decisions (i.e. list of support measures and their envelopes, targeting, etc.). This review, if any, will apply from claim year 2020. In addition, Member States will have to notify only by 31 December 2019 or shortly thereafter their transfers between pillars affecting their national ceiling for direct payments for calendar year 2020. Budgetary implications The amounts included in the transitional proposal are in line with amounts proposed for the CAP under Heading 3 in the proposal covering the Multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. For market-related expenditure financed by the EAGF, allocations under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be adjusted to the level which were proposed for the same sectors in the proposal on support for the CAP strategic plans, for financial year 2021. The amendments of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 ensure that a financial discipline adjustment rate can be determined in financial years 2021 and onwards where the expenditure forecasts for the measures financed under the EAGF net ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings would be exceeded. Thereby, the amendment potentially decreases expenditure under EAGF to the maximum level agreed for the fund in the multiannual financial framework. The amendment of the flexibility provision for calendar year 2020 (financial year 2021) is a technical adjustment to ensure applicability of the provision and does not have any financial implications compared to those intended for the existing provision. The review option for the voluntary coupled support may lead to financial reallocations between measures within the Member States but these will remain within the national ceiling and as such do not require additional financing."
5879,FEAD: specific measures to address the COVID-19 crisis,"PURPOSE: to strengthen the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in order to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and requires exceptional measures to be taken with regard to aid provided to the most deprived under the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The first “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative” (CRII), a package of measures which entered into force on 1 April 2020, introduced a number of important changes to the legislative framework applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds that allow for a more effective response in the current situation. Complementary measures were adopted under the “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus” (CRII Plus). This package also included amendments to Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 (FEAD Regulation), through Regulation (EU) 2020/559 of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing specific measures of additional flexibility and liquidity for Member States to address the COVID-19 pandemic under the FEAD. The direct and indirect effects of the crisis have already taken their toll in many sectors. The process of recovery shall take time and the need for further lockdown measures cannot be excluded. In this context, there is a serious risk that the number of people suffering from food and material deprivation shall increase and therefore further action is required in order to respond to the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure a socially fair recovery in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights. The Commission therefore proposes a further amendment to the Regulation laying down common provisions for the European Structural and Investment Funds (REACT-EU) and the FEAD Regulation in order to provide additional resources to these Funds until 2022. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 so that Member States can provide additional resources to the FEAD until 2022. This shall make additional resources available for basic food and material and accompanying measures, as well as for specific social inclusion measures. The financing of the main post-crisis recovery measures and support for the most deprived may therefore continue uninterrupted. Voluntary increase of resources in response to the COVID-19 outbreak It is proposed that Member States may voluntarily increase the overall resources provided for in the FEAD Regulation to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should consider this possibility taking into account the increase in the number of the most deprived since the emergence of the pandemic. The increase in resources may have an impact on the budgetary commitments for 2020, 2021 and 2022. In order to ensure that Member States have sufficient financial means to prepare for the economic recovery, the proposal provides for a higher level of pre-financing for the rapid implementation of the actions supported by the additional resources. In addition to the pre-financing provided for in the Regulation, the Commission shall pay a pre-financing amount of 50% of the additional resources allocated for the year 2020 following the Commission decision approving the amendment to a programme for the allocation of the additional resources. In order to alleviate the burden on public budgets to repair the damage caused by the crisis, it is foreseen that the additional resources shall not be co-financed. Scope of technical assistance The proposal specifies that at the initiative of the Member States, and subject to a ceiling of 5% of the Fund's allocation at the time of adoption of the operational programme and 5% of the additional resources, the operational programme may finance: - preparatory, management, monitoring, administrative and technical assistance, audit, information, control and evaluation measures necessary for the implementation of the Fund, including the preparation and operating costs of voucher systems if these costs are borne by the managing authority or another public body which is not a partner organisation; - technical assistance measures to partner organisations and any other actor associated with the implementation of the Fund, as well as capacity building measures for partner organisations and any other actor associated with the implementation of the Fund, including measures to stimulate crisis response capacities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions may concern the subsequent programming period, including to ensure the continuation of the support by this Fund through other Funds. Budgetary implications The proposal will lead to: - additional commitments in the year 2020, financed from an increase of the ceiling of the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework; - additional commitments for the years 2021 and 2022, financed from external assigned revenues. The proposal shall trigger additional payments in the years 2020 to 2025."
