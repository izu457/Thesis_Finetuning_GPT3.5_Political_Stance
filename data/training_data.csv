2663EP7,"""""Minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields)""""",0.702,0.897,0.86,0.613,0.394,0.855,0.887,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 2004/40/EC regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from electromagnetic fields. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2006, the medical community informed the Commission of its concerns about implementing this Directive, claiming that the exposure limit values laid down therein would place disproportionate limitations on the use and development of medical magnetic resonance applications (MR), considered today to be a vital tool for the diagnosis and treatment of a number of diseases. Other industrial sectors subsequently expressed their concerns about the impact of the Directive on their activities. In response to these concerns, the Commission took a number of steps: to enable the Commission to conduct an in-depth impact analysis and propose amendments, the deadline for transposition of the Directive was put back from 30 April 2008 to 30 April 2012 by Directive 2008/46/EC ; the Commission examined the situation thoroughly, analysing the latest scientific studies on the negative impact the exposure limit values set by the Directive might have on the medical use of imaging technologies using magnetic resonance (MR) ; after a significant number of consultations of stakeholders and having due regard to the latest scientific recommendations, the Commission adopted, on 14 June 2011, the proposal for a new Directive to amend and replace Directive 2004/40/EC, with a view to guaranteeing a high level of health and safety protection for workers while at the same time enabling medical and other industrial activities using electromagnetic fields to continue and develop; once the Commission proposal had been adopted, the European Parliament and the Council immediately started work with a view to amending Directive 2004/40/EC before 30 April 2012. However, because of i) the technical complexity of the subject-matter, requiring long discussions with national experts; ii) the highly divergent views on some key provisions of the proposal, the European Parliament and the Council will be unlikely to finalise the adoption process before 30 April 2012. Under these circumstances, a new Directive is required to postpone for a second time the deadline for transposition of Directive 2004/40/EC in order to prevent an uncertain legal situation from arising after 30 April 2012 IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given the urgency of the proposal and its limited impact, this proposal is not accompanied by a specific impact assessment. Doing nothing at this stage would oblige the great majority of Member States which have not yet transposed Directive 2004/40/EC into national law to do so and to enforce it within a very short period of time, i.e. by the current deadline of 30 April 2012, with potentially serious consequences for the continuity of healthcare services using MRI. Moreover, the legal uncertainty that might arise due to the non-transposition of the Directive could have the following consequences: the Commission would in principle have to launch infringement proceedings for non-communication of transposition measures against any Member States which have not transposed the Directive yet; Directive 2004/40/EC would start to have direct vertical effect in the national legal order of all Member States, and citizens could take their governments to court for their failure to implement the Directive. Postponing the date of transposition will not unduly impede the use of MRI or other industrial activities. At the same time, postponement would give sufficient time for the Directive, in particular the exposure limit values, to be updated and improved, by means of a new Directive based on the Commission proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is simply to postpone the deadline for the transposition of Directive 2004/40/EC until 30 April 2014. These extra two years will give sufficient time for the Directive, and particularly the exposure limit values, to be updated and improved, by means of a new Directive proposed by the Commission which is currently being discussed in the Council and the EP. The two-year postponement will also avoid any negative legal consequences in the legal orders of Member States which have not yet transposed the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal will have no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the WTO panel report adopted on 19 April 2017 in the WTO dispute settlement proceedings DS492 - measures affecting tariff concessions on certain poultry meat products brought by China against the European Union, the EU needed to comply with the findings. In particular, the panel found that when allocating quantities within tariff rate quotas to supplying countries under WTO rules, the EU should have taken into account as a ‘special factor’ China's increased ability to export poultry products to the EU following the relaxation of sanitary measures in July 2008. The reasonable period of time for the implementation of the Panel Report under the WTO rules began on 19 April 2017. On 12 March 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations on a mutually agreed solution with China. Those negotiations were concluded and an agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and China was initialled on 18 June 2018. The agreement was signed on behalf of the Union subject to its conclusion at a later date. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and China in relation to DS492 European Union - measures affecting tariff concessions on certain poultry meat products. The Agreement seeks to open the following tariff rate quotas (TRQ): The Commission shall adopt implementing Regulations to expand and manage the relevant quotas. These implementation measures are being prepared in parallel with this proposal. Once the quotas are opened, the EU and China shall notify the Agreement to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body as a mutually agreed solution in relation to the dispute DS492. The Commission also needs to provide for transparent and appropriate tariff quota management. Lastly, the Agreement shall also respect rights of other suppliers, which were agreed in the context of past Article XXVIII GATT negotiations."
2350EP8,"""""EU-Timor-Leste agreement on the short-stay visa waiver""""",0.614,0.887,0.88,0.354,0.096,0.896,0.927,0.75,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Timor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Timor-Leste were opened on 19 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 15 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andTimor-Leste on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Timor-Leste when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Timor Leste to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Timor-Leste may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Timor-Leste remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Timor-Leste reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Timor-Leste to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."
8205EP8,"""""Temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders""""",0.0,0.059,0.84,0.333,0.077,0.806,0.853,0.519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to update the Schengen Borders Code to adapt the rules for the reintroduction of temporary internal border controls to the current needs to respond to evolving and persistent serious threats to public policy or internal security. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the secondary movements of irregular migrants and the increase of cross-border terrorist threats posing a serious threat to the internal security of a number of Schengen States, some Members States have been compelled to extend the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls. Based on the current Schengen rules, border controls at internal borders are possible for longer than six months when there are serious deficiencies in the external border management of a Member State, as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation. In situations where the serious threat to public policy or internal security is not related to deficiencies in the management of the external borders as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation, the reintroduction of border control at internal borders is subject to the conditions and time limits set out in the Schengen Borders Code. While the current rules for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls have proved sufficient in the vast majority of cases, the maximum periods laid down in the legislation may not be sufficient when Member States face serious and persistent threats to public order or internal security. This is why the Commission considers it necessary to adapt the maximum periods for the temporary reintroduction of border checks to current needs, while ensuring that the use of this measure remains exceptional and is decided only as a last resort. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to update the Schengen Borders Code to prolong the time limits for internal border controls. Stronger procedural safeguards are also being introduced to ensure that border controls at internal borders remain an exception - a measure of last resort - and are used only if necessary and proportionate, limiting the impact on free movement. The Commission proposes: to increase up to one year (instead of six months) the maximum time limit for temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat and to increase from up to 30 days to up to six months the limit for the length of prolongation periods; to introduce better procedural safeguards in order to ensure that the decision on temporary border control at internal borders or their prolongation is based on a proper risk assessment and is taken in cooperation with the other Member States concerned. Member States will prepare and submit a risk assessment assessing how long the identified threat is expected to persist and which sections of the internal borders are affected and how border control contributed to address the identified threat; to introduce a better follow up to the opinion of the Commission expressing concerns on the necessity or proportionality of border controls being exercised for longer than six months and the consultation procedure involving the Commission, Member States and, as now proposed, relevant Agencies; a new possibility is introduced to extend internal border controls by a maximum period of two years where the serious threat to internal security or public policy persists beyond the one-year deadline , provided that it can be attributed to the same grounds (e.g. threat related to the operation of a cross-border terrorist network) and that commensurate exceptional national measures are taken within the territory to address the threat (such as the state of emergency). Such prolongation would require a Recommendation of the Council, which would need to take into account the opinion given by the Commission, and would be strictly limited to 6 month periods with the possibility to prolong no more than three times up to a maximum period of two years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Brazil entered into force on 7 August 2007. The Agreement provides that it ‘shall initially be valid for a period of five years and may be renewed by agreement between the Parties after evaluation during the penultimate year of each subsequent renewal period’. The Agreement was last renewed in 2012 and remains in force until 7 August 2017, unless the Parties renew it for the next five-year period. Since the Agreement was last renewed, Brazil has made significant advances in its science, technology and innovation (STI) policy, which has contributed to the institutional strengthening of the STI system. Brazil remains at the forefront of research in the field of agriculture, as well as in tropical and infectious diseases. It is also a world-class player in the fields of information and communication technologies, nanotechnologies and energy and it hosts some of Latin America’s top universities. These research areas are of interest to the European Union. The links between Brazil and the EU in science, technology and innovation have been growing through intense cooperation at EU and Member State level. Cooperation between the EU and the Brazilian research community led, among other results, to the development of a new drug for Chagas disease (already registered with the Food and Drug Administration to start clinical testing) and to the development of a new biomass pre-treatment process for advanced bioethanol (allowing the set-up of the first commercial advanced bioethanol plant in Europe). It is, therefore, in the EU’s interest to renew the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Brazil for a new period of five years. This is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: with this proposal for a decision, it is planned to call on the Council to renew the Agreement on cooperation in the field of science and technology between the European Community and Brazil for a further period of 5 years. The content of the renewed Agreement is identical to that of the current Agreement. Cooperation would be maintained for the period from 8 August 2017 to 7 August 2022. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the implementation of the Agreement entails a financial envelope of EUR 345 000 from 2017 to 2022 for expenditure on human and administrative resources."
2112EP7,"""""Officially supported export credits""""",0.842,0.886,0.895,0.484,0.364,0.94,0.892,0.657,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to update the current Council Decisions in force to reflect the most recent version of the Arrangement on guidelines for officially supported export credits concluded in the framework of the OECD. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Community is a Participant in the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits concluded in the framework of the OECD. The main objective of the Arrangement on guidelines for officially supported export credits is to regulate governments' role in export credits, so that exports reflect quality and prices rather than the most favourable officially supported terms, and hence to establish equal conditions of competition among exporters. The Arrangement has always been incorporated into Community law by way of Council Decision. The current version of the Arrangement applicable in the Community is the Decision (2001/76/EC) of 22 December 2000, which was amended by Council Decision of 22 July 2002 with respect of export credits for ships (2002/634/EC). Decision 2001/76/EC is supplemented by the Decision (2001/77/EC) of 22 December 2000 setting forth specific rules on export credits for project finance. The Arrangement has helped to prevent distortions of competition linked with officially supported export credits. It is regularly updated through negotiations via consensus within the OECD framework. The current Council decisions need to be updated to reflect the most recent version of the Arrangement, i.e. OECD document TD/PG(2005)38/FINAL of 05 December 2005. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. CONTENT: the Commission requests the Council to adopt the draft decision approving the revised Arrangement text and ensuring its application in Community law. The guidelines contained in the Arrangement annexed to this Decision shall apply in the Community. The proposal is of a very technical nature and deals only with finance/insurance rules applicable to officially supported export credits covered by OECD Arrangement. Decision 2001/76/EC and the Annex thereto are replaced by this Decision and its Annex. Decisions 2001/77/EC and 2002/634/EC are repealed. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy is one of the main strategic objectives of the Union. On 12 December 2019, the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. The proposed Regulation implements one of the priorities set out in the Communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal and is part of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which provides for specific funding under the Just Transition Mechanism in the context of cohesion policy. The Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) shall provide targeted support to the regions and sectors most affected by transition due to their dependence on fossil fuels or industrial processes that are high emitters of greenhouse gases, to help them mobilise at least EUR 100 billion over the period 2021-2027 and thus mitigate the socio-economic impact of transition. The JTM shall be additional to the contribution made by the EU budget through all instruments directly related to the transition, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund plus (ESF+). It shall have three main sources of funding: (1) a Just Transition Fund, (2) a dedicated scheme under InvestEU and (3) a Public Sector Loan Facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims at establishing the Just Transition Fund (JTF), which is one of the pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism implemented under cohesion policy. Subject matter The aim of the JTF is to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned. In line with the JTF specific objective, actions supported by the JTF should directly contribute to alleviate the impact of the transition by financing the diversification and modernisation of the local economy and by mitigating the negative repercussions on employment. Programming The programming process, including the identification of the territories for intervention and corresponding actions will be agreed in a dialogue between the Commission and each Member State. It will be steered by the European Semester process. Taking into account the Commission’s analysis, Member States shall prepare one or more territorial just transition plans, providing an outline of the transition process until 2030, consistent with the National Energy and Climate Plans and the transition to a climate neutral economy and identifying subsequently the most impacted territories that should be supported. The proposal also establishes a framework for measuring the achievements of the JTF using the relevant indicators and a mechanism for adjusting support if the targets are not met. Scope of support The Fund would essentially provide grants to the regions. The projects funded should contribute to a transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy. The Fund would support, inter alia, the following activities: - productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; - investments in research and innovation activities and in fostering the transfer of advanced technologies; - investments in the deployment of affordable clean energy technologies and infrastructure, in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energies; - investments in strengthening the circular economy, including through waste prevention and reduction, resource efficiency, reuse, repair and recycling; - the up-skilling and reskilling of the affected workers, with the aim of helping them to adapt to new employment opportunities, as well as providing jobsearch assistance to jobseekers and their active inclusion into the labour market. Budget The Fund shall be endowed with EUR 7.5 billion (at 2018 prices) for the period 2021-2027 in addition to what the Commission has proposed for the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). It shall support the ""Investment for jobs and growth"" objective of the new regulation on common provisions (CPR) in all Member States. Member States will complement their Just Transition Fund allocation from their resources under the ERDF and the ESF+ through a specific and definitive transfer mechanism. Member States will also provide national resources to complement the Union resources. The level of Union co-financing will be set according to the category of region in which the identified territories are located. The overall financing capacity of this fund will exceed EUR 30 billion and may reach EUR 50 billion."
8727EP8,"""""Establishing, as part of the Integrated Border Management Fund, the instrument for financial support for customs control equipment""""",0.943,0.914,0.92,0.75,0.154,0.896,0.906,0.212,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish, as part of the integrated border management fund, the instrument for financial support for customs control equipment for the period 2021-2027. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to respond to increased migratory and security challenges, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a new integrated border management fund under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. This new fund aims to provide enhanced support to Member States with a view to securing the Union’s common external borders. Within this framework, it is proposed that the integrated border management fund shall consist of two instruments: a financial support instrument in the field of border and visa management and a financial support instrument for customs control equipment. This proposal only concerns customs control equipment. The Commission shall at the same time present a separate proposal on the instrument in the field of border management and visas. The 2 140 customs offices that are present over the external borders of the European Union need to be properly equipped to ensure the operation of the customs union. In order to avoid the diversion of flows of goods towards the weakest points, it is essential to ensure equivalence in the performance of customs controls throughout the Customs Union. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to create the financial support instrument for customs control equipment as part of integrated border management fund. It lays down the objectives of the Instrument, the budget for the period 2021 – 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Objective : the proposed instrument aims to ensure greater uniformity in the performance of customs controls at the external borders by addressing the current imbalances between Member States due to geographical differences and disparities in capacity and available resources. It shall complement the actions foreseen under the Customs programme. The specific objective of this instrument is to contribute to adequate and equivalent customs control through the purchase, maintenance and upgrade of customs control equipment. The instrument shall be implemented in direct management, by means of grants. The Commission shall set up a coordination mechanism ensuring efficiency and interoperability between all the equipment purchased with the support of Union programmes and instruments. Eligible equipment : equipment shall be eligible only if it relates to at least one of the six following purposes: (i) non-intrusive inspection; (ii) indication of hidden objects on humans; (iii) radiation detection and nuclide identification; (iv) analysis of samples in laboratories; (v) sampling and field analysis of samples; (vi) handheld search. Annex 1 lays down an indicative list of customs control equipment that may be used to achieve the customs control purposes. The Commission may amend this list by means of delegated acts. In addition to the purchase, maintenance and upgrade of eligible equipment, and where appropriate, the instrument will also support the purchase or upgrade of customs control equipment for testing new pieces or new functionalities in operational conditions. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multi-annual framework includes a proposal of EUR 9.31 billion (in current prices) for the integrated border management fund for the period 2021-2027. Within this global envelope, the financial resources available for the implementation of this specific Regulation amount to EUR 1.3 billion (in current prices)."
10134EP8,"""""Adjustment of annual pre-financing for the years 2021 to 2023""""",0.5,0.787,0.04,0.229,0.058,0.91,0.801,0.077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: reduce the annual pre-financing rate for the years 2021 to 2023 (European Structural and Investment Funds). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council defines the common rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds). Evidence suggests that the annual pre-financing paid to Member States for a given accounting year is set at a particularly high level in comparison with financial management requirements stemming from the implementation of operational programmes; this is in particular the case for the budgetary years 2021 to 2023. This means in practice that payment credits are requested from Member States from payment appropriations in the Union's budget to pay to them annual pre-financing that a year later has to be recovered to a significant extent. Therefore, in order to ease the pressure on payment appropriations in the Union budget for the budgetary years 2021 to 2023 and to enhance the predictability of payment requirements, the Commission proposes that for the last three years of the current implementation period 2021-2023, the annual pre-financing is reduced to the necessary minimum. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is not expected to have significant economic, social or environmental impacts. It will result in reducing the annual pre-financing for the proposed years, which will contribute to increasing the predictability of budgetary planning, to a more stable and predictable payment profile, to the reduction of the risk of payment backlogs, to increased transparency in payment needs and, therefore, to better budgetary management. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 aims to decrease the annual pre-financing from 3% of the amount of the support from the Funds and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (‘EMFF’) for the whole programming period to the operational programme to 1% for the years 2021-2023. The annual pre-financing for the year 2020 is maintained at 3% of the amount of the support from the Funds and the EMFF for the whole programming period to the operational programme. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of the ESI Funds financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2014-2020. The amendment proposed will contribute to a reduction in payment appropriations related to the year 2021 entirely due to the reduction of the annual pre-financing amounts which will be compensated by higher payment needs for the year 2024. For the years 2022 and 2023, lower annual pre-financing will be offset in the framework of the examination and acceptance of accounts, therefore the effect is neutral."
1361EP7,"""""EU-Cameroon forest law agreement""""",0.877,0.872,0.93,0.677,0.455,0.964,0.862,0.714,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to conclude a Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the EU and Cameroon on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber and derived products to the EU (FLEGT). PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: in May 2003 the European Commission published an EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) which called for measures to address illegal logging through the development of voluntary partnership agreements with timber-producing countries. Council conclusions on that Action Plan were adopted in October 2003 and Parliament adopted a resolution on the subject on 11 July 2005. The Action Plan proposes a set of measures that include support for timber-producing countries, multilateral collaboration to tackle trade in illegal timber, support for private sector initiatives and measures to stop investment in activities that encourage illegal logging. The cornerstone of the Action Plan is the establishment of FLEGT partnerships between the European Union and timber-producing countries with the aim of stopping illegal logging. In 2005 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 which establishes a licensing scheme and a mechanism to verify the legality of timber imports into the European Union. It is against this background that the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cameroon on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber and derived products to the European Union (FLEGT) is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: first paragraphs of Article 207(3) and (4), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) and Article 218(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the partnership agreement with Cameroon is the third of its kind to be negotiated, after agreements with Ghana and the Republic of Congo. The Agreement addresses all the elements contained in the Council negotiating directives. In particular, the Agreement establishes the framework, institutions and systems for the FLEGT licensing scheme. It outlines: the supply chain controls, legal compliance framework; independent audit requirements for the system. These are set out in annexes to the Agreement which provide a detailed description of the structures that will underpin the assurance of legality offered by the issuance of a FLEGT licence. Cameroon developed its definition of the applicable legislation by means of extensive stakeholder consultations. It includes laws and regulations granting rights to harvest, forest management, environmental, business and labour legislation, fiscal requirements, respect for tenure and use rights of nearby communities and other social obligations laid down in forest laws, as well as regulations governing commercial activity and export trade requirements. The Agreement goes beyond the limited product coverage proposed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (‘the FLEGT Regulation’) to cover trade in all timber products and, in doing so, commits Cameroon to building a system that will provide assurance to the European Union that all forest products from Cameroon are legally harvested and produced and contributing positively and sustainably to Cameroon’s growth. The agreement also: provides for controls on imports at the European Union’s borders, as established by the FLEGT Regulation and the associated Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1024/2008; includes a description of the Cameroon FLEGT licence which adopts the format laid down in the Implementing Regulation; establishes the mechanism for dialogue and cooperation on FLEGT with the European Union, in the form of the Joint Implementation Council and a consultative body known as the Joint Monitoring Committee; establishes the principles of stakeholder participation, social safeguards and transparency for monitoring impacts and reporting. The Agreement sets out a time frame and the procedures for entry into force of the Agreement and for implementing the licensing scheme. Since Cameroon will upgrade and redesign its regulatory and information management system, introduce more comprehensive supply chain controls and establish independent verification of legal compliance, it will take several years to develop and test the new systems and to build capacity on the part of the government, civil society and the private sector for the tasks envisaged. The FLEGT licence scheme is expected to be fully operational by the beginning of 2012. The licence scheme will be assessed against defined criteria before the EU begins accepting FLEGT licences. The steps and process for this are defined in the Agreement and its annexes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
4925EP7,"""""Trade between the Community and third countries in drug precursors""""",0.895,0.89,0.035,0.581,0.515,0.892,0.877,0.2,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to regulate the external trade in medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: drug precursors are chemical substances having a wide variety of licit uses, such as in the synthesis of plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, perfumes, detergents, or aromas. They are traded for legitimate purposes on global markets, but some of them can also be diverted from the licit distribution channels for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs. Taking into account the wide legitimate uses of drug precursors, their trade cannot be prohibited. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are chemical substances used for the manufacture of cold or allergy medicines. These two substances are also the main precursors for the manufacture of methamphetamine. While ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are controlled at international and EU level, the medicinal products containing them are not controlled when they are exported from or transiting through the Union customs territory. They are targeted by drug traffickers as a source of precursors for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine because the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine contained in these products can be easily extracted. Extent of the problem: in 2009, almost 7 400 seizures of methamphetamine, amounting to about 600 kg of the drug, were reported in Europe. Both the number of seizures and quantities increased over 2004-2009. In 2009, illicit methamphetamine laboratories were seized for the first time in several European countries. This is an indication that methamphetamine markets may be expanding in Europe. Seizures of methamphetamine precursors contained in medicinal products have fluctuated considerably from 2007 until 2010. At European level, while in 2007 hardly any preparations were recorded out of the overall quantities seized, in 2008 and 2009 the amount of preparations out of the total quantities seized increased sharply and decreased considerably again in 2010. After the continued increase of seizures of medicinal products from 2007 to 2009, as a result of strengthened controls of medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in several countries, particularly in Mexico and countries in Central America, the total amount of medicinal products seized worldwide decreased in 2010. However, the increasing or decreasing level of seizures is only one indicator to illustrate that illicit manufacture is taking place in a given part of the world. The absence of a control mechanism for medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine remains a concern both at European and at global level. Medicinal products for human use containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine are excluded from the provisions of Regulation (EC) 111/2005, which applies to trade in drug precursors between the EU and third countries. This has led to a situation where these products could not be stopped or seized by Member States' competent authorities when these products were exported from or transiting through the Union customs territory, even though it was very likely that they would be misused for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine in their country of destination. Directive 2011/62/EU which relates to the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of falsified medicinal products addresses the distribution chain for medicines within the EU, importation of active substances, and 'introduction' of medicines, i.e. medicines brought into the customs territory without the intention of placing them on the market. These provisions are focused on preventing products that fall within the definition of falsified medicinal products from entering the legal supply chain. Given that the principal issue with drug precursors is one of legitimately produced products leaving the legal supply chain, it is unlikely that these provisions will make a significant contribution to tackling the issue of controlling medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine being exported or transiting through the EU. The EU is criticised internationally for not taking adequate control measures across Member States to tackle this weakness. By imposing EU control over these medicinal products, this proposal is aiming to make it more difficult, expensive and risky for criminals to source the chemicals they need to manufacture drugs. The proposal should work as a deterrent: it focuses on preventing the diversion of precursors. It concentrates on the supply reduction of the chemicals to make drugs and not on the supply of the drugs for the consumers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment report identified and assessed five policy options: Option 1: ""baseline scenario"": the status quo would be maintained. Option 2: voluntary measures by Member States to improve the situation. Option 3: giving authorities power to stop suspicious shipments. Option 4: giving authorities power to stop suspicious shipments and pre-export notification of legal shipments. Option 5: full control of trade in medicinal products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The impact assessment concluded that Option 4 would be the most suitable one to address the problem, as it would: (i) provide for a legal basis, (ii) impose only one extra control requirement and (iii) generate hardly any additional administrative burden. The proposal notes that even though Option 5 could be considered the most effective by applying the strictest controls, the requirements would be disproportionate to the objective pursued by the present initiative. The added value provided by Option 4 compared to Option 3 is that, under the former Option, the synergy of two combined measures increases the effectiveness of each individual measure. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal provides that any export of medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine should be preceded by a pre-export notification sent by the competent authorities in the Union to the competent authorities of the country of destination. The pre-export notification system is up and running and measures are already compulsory for scheduled substances of Category 1. The proposal contains compulsory measures for the products containing Category 1 substances, such as medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Member States' competent authorities will be given the powers to stop or seize those products when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they are intended for the illicit drug manufacture, when they are exported, imported or in transit. At the moment, most customs authorities can only seize ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as raw substances. The European Database on drug precursors created by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 will be used to: ·  simplify Member States’ reporting with regard to seizures and stopped shipments in accordance with Article 12(12) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988; ·  establish a European register of operators holding a licence or a registration, which will facilitate verification of the legitimacy of their transactions involving scheduled substances and enable operators to provide the competent authorities with information about their export, import or intermediary activities involving scheduled substances. The proposal contains some other amendments aiming at facilitating the implementation of the Regulation and at increasing its effectiveness, the main ones being: ·  the possibility of amending the Annex to the Regulation in order to react more quickly to new emerging trends in precursors diversion; ·  a review clause to assess whether the amended Regulation will have been effective to prevent the diversion of medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine; ·  the adaptation of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 in accordance with the rules on delegated and implementing acts under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not have an impact on human resources and on the European Union budget and is therefore not accompanied by a financial statement. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 111/2005, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be delegated to the Commission for specific purposes listed in the text."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2011, Jordan's economy has been significantly affected by the domestic events related to the Arab Spring and the ongoing regional unrest. Combined with a weaker global environment, the political transition of Jordan has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. Jordan has also been affected by the intensification of the Syria crisis, notably through the inflow of refugees and its fiscal implications ( about 1000 Syrians crossing Jordanian borders every day). It has welcomed about 180 000 refugees since January 2013. While Jordan has so far managed to date to maintain macroeconomic stability, including through substantial fiscal consolidation efforts and financial support from foreign donors, there are significant balance of payments and financing needs. Under the pressure of a sharp drop of international reserves in the first half of 2012, the Jordanian authorities have agreed on a USD 2 billion (800% of quota), 36-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund, approved on August 2012. In this context, the Jordanian government requested Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU in the amount of EUR 200 million in December 2012. Consequently, the Commission presents this proposal for MFA to the benefit of Jordan amounting to a maximum of EUR 180 million in the form of loans. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed that the Union shall make available to Jordan macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 180 million, with a view to supporting Jordan's economic stabilisation and reforms. The assistance shall contribute to covering Jordan's balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF programme. The full amount of the macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Jordan in the form of loans which shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. The Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions in order to lend them to Jordan. Objective of the loan : the EU's MFA would contribute towards covering Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2013 and 2014, in the context of the IMF programme. It would help Jordan address the lingering economic consequences of the Arab Spring and the external shocks of its energy sector. It would reduce the economy's short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities, while supporting the adjustment and reform programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the reforms agreed under the EU's budgetary support operations. The proposed assistance would: promote policy measures to improve public financial management and tax reform while strengthening the social safety net (including through a better targeting of the cash transfers system); measures to improve the regulatory framework and climate for investment; and reforms to reduce unemployment and encourage participation in the labour market, notably among women. Release measures : the Commission: shall manage the provision of the assistance in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Jordan and with the key principles and objectives of economic reforms set out in the EU-Jordan Association Agreement and the EU-Jordan Action Plan for 2010-2015 agreed under the European Neighbourhood Policy; shall regularly inform the European Parliament and the Economic and Financial Committee of developments in the management of the Union macro-financial assistance and provide them with relevant documents. The Union macro-financial assistance shall be made available for a period of two years from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to the proposal. Other implementing measures : instalments : the assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments and to allow some frontloading given the urgency of the financing needs. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the second half of 2013. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the first half of 2014; disbursement : this assistance is of macroeconomic nature and its design is consistent with the IMF-supported economic programme. The monitoring of the action by the Commission services will take place on the basis of progress in the implementation of the SBA and specific reform measures to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment); management : the assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. Implementing powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The fact that the assistance is of a substantial amount and, therefore, has a potentially important impact, justifies the use of the examination procedure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the MFA would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 04 01 14. Assuming that the first loan disbursement will be made in 2013 for the amount of EUR 100 million and the second loan disbursement in 2014 for the amount of EUR 80 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2015-16 budgets."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: the Council adopted a general approach with regard to the proposal for a Council Regulation entrusting the European Central Bank with specific tasks concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board. The text has been modified to comply with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It should be recalled that experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. The Commission proposed a regulation establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) with aim to reinforce financial supervision in Europe. The Council reached a broad agreement on the substance of the regulation. Given its expertise on macro-prudential issues, the European Central Bank (ECB) can make a significant contribution to the effective macro-prudential oversight of the EU financial system. As a consequence, the proposed regulation provides that: · the President of the European Central Bank shall be Member of the General Board of the European Systemic Risk Board; · the European Central Bank shall ensure a Secretariat, and thereby provide analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB. The mission of the Secretariat shall prepare the ESRB meetings and ensure the collection and processing of information, including statistical information, on behalf and for the benefit of the fulfilment of the tasks of the ESRB; · the ECB shall ensure sufficient, human and financial resources for the fulfilment of its task of ensuring the Secretariat; · without prejudice to the application of criminal law, any confidential information received by the Secretariat whilst performing its duties may not be divulged to any person or authority whatsoever outside the ESRB, except in summary or aggregate form, such that individual financial institutions cannot be identified; · the Secretariat shall ensure that documents are submitted to the ESRB in a manner which ensures the confidentiality of these documents. The ECB shall ensure the confidentiality of the data received by the Secretariat for the performance of the tasks of the ECB under this Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of an authorization from Council, the Commission negotiated, on behalf of the EU, the renewal of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania. At the end of those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 10 July 2015. It is now appropriate to conclude that Protocol. CONTENT: the draft decision calls on the Council to approve the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mauritania for a period of four years on behalf of the Union. Objectives: the main aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Mauritanian waters taking into account available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The objective is to also enhance cooperation between the European Union and Mauritania, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in the interests of both parties. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution has been set at EUR 59 125 000 per year, on the basis of: Duration of the agreement: the Protocol covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application, i.e. from the date of its signature."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative is part of the third ‘Europe on the Move’ package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017, and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. Investment in transport infrastructure significantly contributes to achieving these objectives. In particular, the completion of the Trans-European Network for Transport (TEN-T) core network and its corridors is expected to generate an additional EUR 4.500 billion or 1.8% of EU GDP and account for 13 million job-years until 2030. Notwithstanding the necessity and binding timelines, experience has shown that many investments aiming to complete the TEN-T are confronted with complex permit granting procedures, cross-border procurement procedures and other procedures. This situation jeopardises the on time implementation of projects and in many cases results in significant delays and increased costs. In order to address these issues and make synchronised TEN-T completion possible,, harmonised action is necessary at Union level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options were based on increasing levels of intervention, ambition and ‘cumulative’ expected impact. The preferred option is that of a limited binding action to be decentralised and implemented at national level. The specific expected benefits should be as follows: time savings in the permit granting procedures; 5 billion in user cost savings; mobilisation, before 2025, of 84% of total investment in the TEN-T core network; 700 million and an estimated reduction in CO2 emissions of 2.686 thousand tonnes for the period 2018-2030; 150 million net savings for project promoters and public authorities. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks the effective and timely completion of TEN-T across the Union, by reducing the risk of delays and increasing the level of certainty for project promoters and investors as regards the length of the applicable procedures. Another objective is to facilitate the involvement of private investors and provide more clarity on public consultations. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Priority status of projects of common interest : each project of common interest on the TEN-T core network shall be subject to an integrated permit granting procedure managed by a single competent authority designated by each Member State. Where priority status exists under national law, projects of common interest shall be granted the status with the highest national significance possible, and be treated as such in permit granting procedures, where and in the manner such treatment is provided for in national legislation applicable to the corresponding types of transport infrastructure. Integration of the permit granting procedures : the proposal requires that the authorisation of TEN-T projects is handled by one single authority that manages and takes ownership of the overall process and acts as the single entry point for project promoters and other investors. The proposal deals with the designation and role of such an authority and defines the procedural steps leading to a comprehensive decision authorising the investor to go ahead with the project. Permit granting procedures are be expected to last up to a maximum of three years which is a significant improvement in comparison to the current situation. Coordination : the proposal stresses the importance of coordinating permit granting procedures across borders and strengthens the role of the European Coordinators in monitoring the permit granting procedure. Public procurement : the proposal provides for the application of only one legal framework on public procurement for cross-border projects. Unless otherwise specified in an intergovernmental agreement, joint entities developing such projects will apply a single national legislation to procure works and services when implementing the project."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: The EU completed in early August 2010 the disbursement of a EUR 46 million macrofinancial assistance (MFA) operation to Georgia approved by the Council in November 2009. The assistance, which was provided in the form of grants, was part of a pledge of two possible MFA operations of the same amount made by the European Commission at the International Donors' Conference of October 2008. The approval of the second MFA was conditional on the continued existence of external financing needs over and above those covered by the IMF arrangement. In a letter from 10 May 2010, the Georgian Minister of Finance requested the activation of the second part of the Commission pledge of EU funds, amounting to EUR 46 million, which is the subject of this proposal. The Commission considers that the activation of the second part of the MFA pledged in 2008 is warranted. Although the Georgian economy is recovering (following the double shock caused by the military conflict with Russia of August 2008 and the global financial crisis), the balance of payments and budgetary position remain weak and vulnerable. The new MFA would contribute to help Georgia to address the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis. The new MFA will support the economic reform agenda of the government. It would reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance would also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management, as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the MFA and the economic adjustment and reform programme attached to it will help alleviate Georgia's short-term financing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening medium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability, raising sustainable growth and promoting economic integration and regulatory convergence with the EU. It will also help improve the efficiency and transparency of public finance management, building on the positive impact of the previous MFA operation in the country. MFA will also support the macroeconomic stabilisation and structural policies of the programme agreed with the IMF. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the EU shall make the MFA available to Georgia for a total maximum amount of EUR 46 million, half of which will be provided as grants and half as loans. The assistance will contribute to cover Georgia's residual external financing needs in 2009-2011, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance will be disbursed in 2011 in two equal instalments, each of them consisting of a grant and a loan element. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be taken into account. The main points are as follows: the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2011; the second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the third quarter of 2011; as is usual with the MFA instrument, the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement; in addition, the Commission and the Georgian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. In the context of the previous MFA operations, the Commission services have worked closely with the Georgian authorities on public finance management (PFM) reforms that aim at establishing a more transparent, coherent and accountable PFM system; in the new MFA operation, the scope of the policy conditionality would be enlarged, notably to measures aimed at fostering the economic and financial integration as well as regulatory harmonisation with the EU in selected areas, under the ENP Action Plan and taking into account the new context created by the plan to conclude an Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia; the new MFA would be exceptional and limited in time and is intended to run in parallel to the SBA. It will complement support from international and bilateral donors; the proposal includes a sunset clause. The proposed MFA would be made available for 2.5 years starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Following the successful implementation of the last MFA, in which the Georgian authorities demonstrated the political will and the capacity to implement structural reforms, the Commission believes that also this second MFA operation would contribute to the implementation of the government's agenda of structural reforms. The conditions will be consistent with the priorities of the EU-Georgia ENP Action Plan. The decision to disburse half of the proposed assistance in grants and the other half in loans is justified by Georgia’s level of development (as measured by its per capital income) and debt indicators, and the recent improvement in the country's economic situation. The full use of grants in the previous operation had to be understood as an exceptional decision justified by the very difficult circumstances Georgia found itself in late 2008. The blend of grants and loans is also consistent with the fact that Georgia has been a blend country for the World Bank since January 2009. For the forthcoming World Bank operations, the country is expected to receive one third of the World Bank assistance in the form of the IDA lending, while two thirds of the assistance are expected to be provided on IBRD terms. The new MFA will reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance will also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management (building on those of the previous operation and of the EU's sectoral budgetary support operation), as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the grant element of the assistance of EUR 23 million would be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2011 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), with payments taking place in 2011. In line with the Guarantee Fund Regulation, the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund is expected to take place in 2013 and to amount to a maximum of EUR 2.1 million. This corresponds to 9% of the EUR 23 million loan expected to be disbursed in 2011."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) infringements and the resulting trade in infringing goods are of growing concern, particularly in a globalised economy. In addition to the economic consequences for industry, the infringing products may pose serious health and safety risks to consumers. Certain instances of detentions by customs authorities of shipments of medicines in transit through the EU, which occurred at the end of 2008, which together with the concerns expressed during the WTO consultations between India and Brazil and the EU, have shown that the relevant EU legislation for intellectual property enforcement by customs authorities could benefit from further clarification to increase legal certainty. In its Communication on a Single Market Act, the Commission recalled that customs authorities should be able to provide greater protection for intellectual-property rights through revised legislation. The Commission developed a new customs action plan to combat IPR infringements for the years 2009-2012. The main elements of the Plan were endorsed by the Council. The review of Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 showed that certain improvements to the legal framework were necessary to strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property rights, as well as to ensure appropriate legal clarity, thereby taking into account developments in the economic, commercial and legal areas. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment report looked at three different options, with a number of sub-options. Option 1: ‘ baseline scenario’, where the Commission would take no action and the status quo was maintained. Option 2 : this provided for certain non-legislative measures, where the Commission would propose training initiatives and the development of guidelines and exchange of best practises; Option 3: the Commission proposes amendments to the existing legal framework. Under this option different sub-options could be available for each of the i problems: Sub-option 1 provided for the extension of the possible types of infringements to rights already covered by the current Regulation, for example, as regards goods involving any infringement of trade mark rights, not just counterfeiting. Sub-option 2 included sub-option 1 and extended the current scope of the Regulation in terms of IPR covered. The impact assessment concluded that the best suitable solution would be to amend the Regulation to respond to all the problems identified and to ensure a balanced outcome for all categories of persons affected. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides powers to adopt measures for implementing the common commercial policy. The Regulation concerns the commercial aspects of intellectual property rights in that it deals with measures enabling customs to enforce intellectual property rights at the border on goods that are internationally traded. CONTENT: the draft Regulation sets out the conditions and procedures for action by the customs authorities where goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right are, or should have been, subject to customs supervision within the customs territory of the Union. The main points are as follows: Strengthening enforcement : it is proposed to broaden the scope covered by Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003, by including trade names, topographies of semiconductor products and utility models. It is also proposed to widen the scope of the Regulation by including infringements resulting from parallel trade and devices to circumvent technological measures, as well as other infringements of rights already enforced by customs. The new Regulation would maintain the ability for customs to control for the purpose of enforcement of intellectual property rights, in all situations where the goods were under their supervision and the distinction between the procedural nature of the legislation and substantive law on intellectual property would be emphasised. Destruction of goods : the proposal also introduces procedures enabling customs, under certain conditions, to have goods abandoned for destruction without having to undergo formal and costly legal proceedings. These would be differentiated according to the type of infringement. for counterfeit and pirated goods, the agreement of the owner to destroy the goods could be presumed if the destruction had not been explicitly opposed, whereas for other situations, the owner of the goods would have to agree explicitly to their destruction; in a case where no agreement is reached, the right-holder would have to initiate legal proceedings to establish the infringement, otherwise the goods will be released. A specific procedure is also proposed for small consignments of suspected counterfeit and pirated goods covered by an application, which would allow for goods to be destroyed without the involvement of the right- holder. Protection of the interests of legitimate traders : additional provisions are proposed to ensure the protection of the interests of legitimate traders from possible abuse of the customs enforcement procedures and to integrate the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Regulation. To this end, the proposal clarifies the timelines for detaining suspected goods, the conditions in which information about consignments would be passed on to right-holders by customs, the conditions for applying the procedure allowing for destruction of the goods under customs control for suspected infringements of intellectual property rights other than for counterfeiting and piracy, and the right of defence. Costs of storage and destruction of goods : the draft Regulation continues to provide that storage and destruction costs directly incurred by customs be assumed by the right-holders requesting customs action, though this would not preclude them from taking legal action to recover such costs from the primary liable party. However, it is proposed to introduce an important exception for small consignments, for which storage and destruction costs would be assumed by customs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Special Partnership between the EU and Cabo Verde was approved by the Council of the European Union on 19 November 2007. One of its objectives is to increase mobility and people-to-people contacts between citizens of the Union and Cabo Verde, as well as to strengthen cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration. On 1 December 2014, the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union entered into force. After almost 5 years of implementation of these Agreements and in light of the supervened changes of both the EU and Cabo Verde’s domestic legislation related to visas, namely the revision of the EU’s Visa Code 3 and Cabo Verde decision to exempt EU citizens from the visa requirement for stays up to 30 days, the Joint Committee set up by the existing agreement explored the need to amend certain rules thereby established, with a view to adapt it to the changed circumstances. On that basis, the Commission presented on 13 September 2019, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate an Agreement amending the existing Visa Facilitation Agreement with the Republic of Cabo Verde. The Council having given its authorisation, the chief negotiators reached an agreement in principle on the draft text of the agreement, initialled on 24 July 2020 through an exchange of e-mails. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cabo Verde amending the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas to the citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union. The purpose of the agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issuance of visas for an intended stay of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement provides for the following: - the reduction of the visa fee for processing applications to 75% of the amount to be charged in accordance with the applicable domestic (i.e. EUR 60 for Cabo Verdean citizens); for children of at least 12 years of age (but under 18 years of age), the fee is further reduced by 50% compared to the generally applicable amount (i.e. EUR 30 for Cabo Verdean citizens); - simplification of the documents required to justify the purpose of the journey for certain categories of applicants, e.g. business people; spouses, children and parents of Union citizens or Cabo Verdean citizens legally residing in the EU; schoolchildren, students; participants in scientific, cultural, sporting or religious events, journalists and persons travelling for medical reasons; - the modification of the rules on the issuing of multiple-entry visas focusing on the previous lawful use of the visa during a given reference period rather than on the purpose of travel of the applicants; - the exemption from the visa requirement for short stays for holders of a valid EU laissez-passer; - the possibility for the parties to suspend the agreement in whole or in part for any reason deemed appropriate; - the amendment of the general clause of the agreement to ensure that: (i) the facilitation granted to Cabo Verdean citizens would be granted to EU citizens if the visa requirement for stays of up to 30 days re-imposed for their visit to Cabo Verde; (ii) at least the same facilitation are granted to EU citizens applying for a Cabo Verde visa for stays exceeding 30 days but not exceeding 90 days; - the amendment of the Joint Declaration on cooperation on travel documents to include a reference to Cabo Verde’s internal legislation introducing biometric travel documents."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: u nemployment and persistently high rates of poverty call for action at EU and national level. Almost 23 million people are today unemployed and over 113 million are estimated to be living at risk of poverty or exclusion. Social and employment issues are a primary concern of European citizens, and an area where more is expected from the Union. Additional challenges that the Union faces relate to: shortfalls in skill levels, under-performance in active labour market policy and education systems, social exclusion of marginalised groups, and low labour mobility. There is a need both for policy initiatives and for concrete supporting actions. The European Social Fund (ESF) supports policies and priorities aiming to achieve progress towards full employment, enhance quality and productivity at work, increase the geographical and occupational mobility of workers within the Union, improve education and training systems, and promote social inclusion, thereby contributing to economic, social and territorial cohesion. As the ESF should be fully aligned with the Europe 2020 Strategy and its headline targets, it  should support the policies pursued by the Member States under the Integrated Guidelines adopted in accordance with the Treaty and the Recommendations on the National Reform Programmes. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment for the ESF Regulation mainly addressed the scope of the instrument and one specific aspect of simplification. It also discussed the articulation between and complementarity with the financial instruments available to the Commission’s Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, notably the ESF, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the PROGRESS programme, EURES and the PROGRESS Microfinance Facility. The ESF is seen as providing considerable European added value and has received very broad support. Concentration on the main challenges and Council Recommendations is widely seen as an important precondition for the effectiveness of support. Reducing the complexity of support and the related audit burden, notably for smaller beneficiaries, is also seen as an important area that needs to be addressed. LEGAL BASIS: Article 164 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the present proposal defines the ESF’s mission and scope for 2014-2020, together with the associated investment priorities addressing the thematic objectives, and lays down specific provisions concerning operational programmes co-financed by the ESF and concerning eligible expenditure. Scope : the draft ESF Regulation for 2014-2020 proposes to target the ESF on four ‘thematic objectives’ throughout the European Union: (i) promoting employment and labour mobility; (ii) investing in education, skills and lifelong learning; (iii) promoting social inclusion and combating poverty; (iv) enhancing institutional capacity and an efficient public administration. Each thematic objective is translated into intervention categories or ‘investment priorities’ . In addition, the ESF should contribute also to other thematic objectives such as supporting the shift towards low-carbon, climate resilient and resource efficient economy, enhancing the use of information and communication technologies, strengthening research, technological development and innovation and enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. Concentration of funding : in order to ensure this concentration, it is proposed that: support for administrative capacity should be limited to Member States with less developed regions or eligible to the Cohesion Fund; at least 20 % of the ESF allocation should be dedicated to ‘promoting social inclusion and combating poverty’; operational programmes should concentrate funding on a limited number of ‘investment priorities’. Gender equality : the draft Regulation clarifies and strengthens the ESF contribution to the Union's commitment to eliminate inequalities between women and men and prevent discrimination. Member States should combine a robust mainstreaming approach and specific actions to promote gender equality and non-discrimination. Social innovation and cooperation : the proposal aims to reinforce social innovation and transnational cooperation under the ESF, through an incentive in the form of a higher co-funding rate for priority axes dedicated to them, specific programming and monitoring arrangements, and a stronger role for the Commission in the exchange and dissemination of good practices, joint actions and results across the Union. Monitoring and evaluation systems : the draft Regulation proposes minimum quality standards and a set of compulsory common indicators. This should ensure that monitoring produces robust and reliable data that can easily be aggregated at EU level and that evaluation focuses on assessing the effectiveness and impact of ESF support. Social partners : for the less-developed regions and countries, the draft Regulation calls for an appropriate amount of ESF resources to be allocated to capacity building actions for social partners and non-governmental organisations. Joint activities undertaken by the social partners will also be supported, considering their vital role in the field of employment, education and social inclusion. Small beneficiaries : the draft Regulation proposes a limited number of specific eligibility rules to facilitate access to ESF funding for smaller beneficiaries and operations and to take account of the different nature of ESF operations and the different type of ESF beneficiaries as compared to other Funds. In order to ensure that simplification reaches the beneficiaries, the draft Regulation proposes to extend the use of simplified cost options, including by making their use obligatory for smaller operations. These provisions will reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries and managing authorities, strengthen the results orientation of the ESF and will contribute to reducing error rates. Financial instruments : lastly, specific provisions are introduced for financial instruments to encourage Member States and regions to leverage the ESF and thus increase its capacity to finance actions supporting employment, education and social inclusion. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund). The present proposal establishes minimum shares for the ESF for each category of regions defined in the proposal for a General Regulation. This results in a minimum overall share for the ESF of 25 % of the budget allocated to cohesion policy (excluding the allocation to the Connecting Europe Facility), i.e. EUR 84 billion. The indicated minimum ESF allocation includes the budget (EUR 2.5 billion) for a forthcoming Commission proposal regarding food support for the most deprived persons. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening-up of certain Union programmes and agencies to the participation of ENP partner countries represents one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union’s neighbourhood. The Commission outlined this policy aspect more extensively in its Communication of December 2006 ‘on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes’. The Council endorsed this approach in its conclusions of 5 March 2007. On 18 June 2007, the Council issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. In February 2013, Algeria expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the protocol negotiated with Algeria is attached to this proposal. It is now necessary to conclude this Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Algeria on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes. It contains standard clauses that are intended to be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with which such protocols are concluded. Objective: the objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure which gives access to assistance, in particular financial assistance, to be provided by the Union pursuant to the Union programmes. This framework applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of Algeria’s participation. The signing and provisional application of the Protocol therefore does not entail the exercise of the powers under the various sectoral policies pursued by the programmes which are exercised when establishing the programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Council of 8‑9 March 2007 underlined that reducing administrative burden is important for boosting the European economy, especially considering the potential benefits this can bring for SMEs. In this context, it called on the Commission to identify new ""fast track"" legislative proposals in order to reduce administrative burdens. Accounting and auditing have been identified as key areas for reducing administrative burden for European companies. Furthermore, the European Parliament encourages the Commission to continue its activities with regard to the simplification of company law, accounting and auditing, in particular the 4th and 7th Company Law Directives, and explicitly calls on the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal that allows Member States to exempt local and regional undertakings from the scope of the Accounting Directives. The 4th Company Law Directive was adopted in 1978 in order to create a harmonised set of requirements for the external reporting of all limited liability companies in the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers six options: Option 0 : No change to the Directives; Option 1 : Encourage a full use of existing options in the Accounting Directives; Option 2 : Obligatory exemption of micro entities from the scope of the Directives; Option 3 : Member State option to exempt micro entities from the scope of the Directives; Option 4 : Introduction of a simplified accounting regime for micro entities; Option 5 : Amendments to the Accounting Directive without introducing the micro category. The Commission considers that the option that provides the biggest burden reduction is Option 3 (option to exempt micro entities). This option can also be implemented within the shortest timeframe. CONTENT: the Commission suggests establishing an option for Member States of removing the micro-entities from the scope of the 4th Company Law Directive and, by doing so, relieving them from the requirement to draw up annual accounts. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to add a new Article 1a to the 4th Company Law Directive extending the discretion of Member States to relieve the micro-entities from the scope of the 4th Company Law Directive. According to that Article, Member States may provide for an exemption from the obligations under the Directive for companies which on their balance sheet dates do not exceed the limits of two of the three following criteria: balance sheet total: EUR 500 000; net turnover: EUR 1 000 000; average number of employees during the financial year: 10. However, it needs to be recalled, that companies, including micro entities, keep records of sales and transactions for their own management purposes and for tax reporting. The Directive will enable Member States to align the financial reporting to such other reporting needs to avoid unnecessary administrative burden. Micro entities can on a voluntary basis still draw up annual accounts, have them audited and send them to the national register. These changes should lead to reduced administrative burden while safeguarding adequate protection and information to stakeholders and enable alignment of the micro-entities' reporting requirements with the real needs of users and preparers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he euro continues to be an attractive target for organised crime groups active in counterfeiting money, not only in Europe but also in other regions of the world. The international dimension of the threat with respect to euro counterfeiting calls for supranational coordination in facing it; through the Pericles programme, the Commission conducts such coordination by way of exchanges, training activities and technical assistance. Activities with the aim of promoting exchanges of information and staff, technical and scientific assistance and specialised training help significantly to protect Europe’s single currency against counterfeiting and related fraud and therefore to attain a high and equivalent level of protection across the Union. Past support for such initiatives, through Council Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ""Pericles"" programme), has made it possible to enhance the activities of the Union and the Member States in the field of the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. The objectives of the Pericles programme for both the period 2002-2006 and the period 2007-2013 were successfully achieved. The Treaty reflects concerns about the protection of the euro by providing for the measures necessary for its use as a single currency. As the legal basis for Pericles will expire at the end of 2013, its replacement should ensure the continuity of Union support for the activities carried out by the Commission and the Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: f our options have been considered: Option 1 : continue the programme with the same level of funding (baseline scenario). Option 2 : renew the Pericles programme with improved objectives and methodology, including in particular an increased maximum rate of co-financing. Option 3 : merge Pericles with other Commission programmes. Option 4 : discontinue the Pericles programme, and leave it for Member States to organise activities at national level for protecting the euro. The option to renew the programme with improved objectives and methodology is preferred (Option 2). This option has a budgetary allocation in real prices that remains similar to the current allocation (approximately one million euro per year). It adds flexibility in determining the amount of the grant by simplifying the determination of costs to be borne by Member States; it broadens the range of eligible activities by making it possible to finance the purchase of equipment to be used by specialised anti-counterfeiting agencies in for protecting the euro against counterfeiting; and it increases the rate of co-financing up to a maximum of 90 % of eligible costs, in duly justified cases. The higher rate of co-financing will particularly facilitate a more balanced geographic distribution of activities by offering wider scope for Member States to apply. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The application of the Pericles programme will be extended to the Member States that have not adopted the euro as their single currency, through a proposal for a parallel Regulation based on Article 352 TFEU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to establish a multiannual action programme ‘Pericles 2020’ to promote activities for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and related fraud. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The Programme shall contribute to increased transnational cooperation for the protection of the euro at Union level and internationally and to the greater effectiveness of these operations on the basis of best practices, common standards and joint specialised training. The general objective of the Programme shall be to prevent and combat counterfeiting and fraud thus enhancing the competitiveness of the European economy and securing the sustainability of public finances. The specific objective of the Programme shall be to protect the euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting and related fraud, by supporting and supplement the measures undertaken by the Member States and assisting the competent national and European authorities in their efforts to develop between themselves and with the European Commission a close and regular cooperation, also including third countries and international organisations. The Pericles programme concerns this specific sphere of activity of the European Commission and its cooperation with Member States’ competent authorities, as well as with the other European institutions and bodies, more particularly through OLAF. Support from programmes designed to have a wider impact would be less effective in addressing such a specific issue and, in political terms, the EU institutions should demonstrate that they share a real determination to deal with this important aspect of EU policy and European identity. Accordingly, the Pericles programme will: target exclusively the protection of the euro, in the context of a long-term vision that is consistent with other EU objectives, on the basis of the priorities set each year for this specific field of expertise; allow the implementation of other EU programmes to focus on priorities other than the protection of the euro; fully take into account the results of the activities already co-financed in the past in this field, including in terms of targeted rules for beneficiaries and geographical balance; aim not only to have a direct impact on the situation of some Member States but to place strong emphasis on the EU dimension of the protection of Europe’s single currency. The Pericles 2020 programme will make a substantial contribution to maintaining and further improving the high level of protection of the euro associated with the intensification of cross-border cooperation, exchanges and assistance. At the same time, overall savings will be achieved from the collectively organised activities and procurement, as compared to potential individual national initiatives. Priorities and implementation strategies are regularly discussed at meetings of the Euro Counterfeiting Experts Group (ECEG). The ECEG coordinates and is associated with the implementation of Pericles activities. In addition, the objectives have been renewed with special attention to setting Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) criteria. This will also help to ensure proper implementation and monitoring. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the overall budget is EUR 7 700 000 in current prices. This amount is in line with the Commission proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020: ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the United States of America and the European Commission regarding the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by the United States to certain products of the European Communities, endorsed by the Council by letter of 12 May 2009 and signed in Geneva on 13 May 2009. The aim of that Memorandum of Understanding is to settle the long-standing WTO dispute between the European Union and the United States of America on Beef Hormones, European Communities— Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products (Hormones) (DS 26). It foresees a three-phased arrangement which progressively reduces the level of sanctions imposed by the United States on products from the Union, while the Union progressively increases the tariff-rate quota for high-quality beef that is not treated with growth hormones. The first-phase tariff-rate quota for high quality beef of 20 000 tonnes was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2009. In a second phase, the United States would suspend all remaining sanctions and the Union would expand this tariff rate quota by additional 25 000 tonnes. On 17 March 2011, the Commission also signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Canada and the European Commission regarding the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by Canada to certain products of the European Union.  This MoU brings about the suspension of all sanctions imposed by Canada and stipulates the further expansion of the Union autonomous tariff rate quota for high-quality beef by 1 500 tonnes (first phase) and additional 1 700 tonnes (second phase). The timing foreseen for the first and second phases in the US and Canada Memoranda is the same. It is envisaged in particular that the second phase would normally begin on 1 August 2012 under both Memoranda. In order to be in a position to establish the above-mentioned increases of the existing tariff rate quota for high-quality beef, to a total of 21 500 tonnes (first phase) and subsequently, 48 200 tonnes foreseen in the second phase of both Memoranda of Understanding starting on 1 August 2012, the legislative procedure needs to be started in a timely manner. This is also necessary in order to follow the Resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 8 March 2011 calling on the Commission to ensure that the settlement of the 'beef hormones' dispute will allow for the suspension of the sanctions on EU products, while guaranteeing that beef imports to the EU will be in line with EU requirements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to request the European Parliament and the Council to amend the existing Regulation opening an autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef, in order to implement the steps set out in the MoU signed with the United States of America and Canada, respectively. The measure aims to modify the annual autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef in the context of the EU-US and the EU-Canada Memoranda of Understanding on ""beef hormones"". This quota was initially established by Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2009. It increases the tariff quota by 1 500 tonnes in the first phase following the EU-Canada MoU. In the second phase (from August 2012) an increase of the tariff quota by 26 700 tonnes is foreseen, as envisaged by the EU-US MoU and the EU-Canada MoU. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the customs duty of this tariff-rate quota would remain fixed at zero. Depending on the future beef market situation, imports of high-quality beef may therefore no longer be shipped using the existing quota set up by Regulation (EC) No 810/2008 or out-of-quota. This may imply a loss of own resources of the Union which would be approximately EUR 4.6 million net amount after deduction of collection costs for Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: before a vehicle may be put on the market, it has to fulfil all the relevant type or individual approval requirements guaranteeing an optimal level of safety and environmental standards. Following this approval, cars on the road have to be regularly submitted to periodic roadworthiness tests. The goal of roadworthiness testing is to check the functionality of safety components, the environmental performance and the compliance of a vehicle with its approval. The proposal aims at contributing to reach the target of a reduction of road fatalities by half until 2020 as laid down in the Policy Orientations on Road Safety 2011-2020. It will also contribute to the reduction of emissions in road transport linked to poor maintenance of vehicles, following the European Strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles as well as the integrated energy and climate change policy. The proposal is part of a package of measures which also includes: a proposal for a regulation on technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Union and repealing Directive 2000/30/EC and a proposal for a regulation on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the following options were considered: Option 1: the 'No policy change' approach where the present EU legal framework would be maintained; Option 2: the ""Soft law approach"" would consist in both better implementation and better monitoring of the application of existing legislation; Option 3: the ""Legislative approach"" would be based on two components: (a) revising upwards the minimum EU standards for periodic roadworthiness tests (PTI) and unexpected roadside inspections (RSI) and define mandatory standards; (b) in a second phase, the possible establishment of and EU harmonised data exchange system linking the existing databases. The impact assessment has shown the benefits of a combination of a soft-law approach with a regulatory approach. Therefore, the soft-law measures have been integrated into the legislative texts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal will amend the existing requirements laid down in the existing legislative framework related to the registration documents for vehicles (Directive 1999/37/EC). It aims at improving the enforcement of the roadworthiness testing and roadside inspection regime, notably in the case where the technical condition of a vehicle creates an imminent risk to road safety. Compared to the existing act, the proposal provides for more precise definitions on the place of registration of vehicles, withdrawal and cancellation of registrations. The proposal also lays down new requirements on electronic vehicle registration registers and the follow up of notifications related to roadworthiness test results, re-registration and destruction of vehicles. Withdrawal and cancellation of registrations : the proposal: notified as 'end of life vehicle' shall be cancelled following its notification. Electronic registers: the proposal also introduces the establishment of electronic registers containing all information related to the vehicle registration. This information will be made accessible for the purpose of roadworthiness testing as only a part of this information is printed on the registration certificates. The register provides for follow-up after notification of roadworthiness test results, re-registration and destruction of a vehicle. Commission’s powers: the Commission shall be empowered to update the annexes taking into account the evolution of the EU type-approval legislation in relation with the content of certificates of conformity as well as technical progress via delegated acts. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States – with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom – and also by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Regulation is part of the EU’s common visa policy for short stays of 90 days in any 180-day period. Kosovo is currently listed in Annex I, Part 2 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 , i.e. among those entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as states by at least one Member State. Persons from those entities are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. Since launching the visa dialogue in January 2012, the Commission has presented regular reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on its assessment of Kosovo’s fulfilment of the requirements of the roadmap which identified all the legislation and other measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. In its last report, the Commission set out recommendations corresponding to outstanding requirements of the visa roadmap, including four key priorities. It noted the border/boundary delineation agreement with Montenegro should be ratified by Kosovo before visa free status is granted to persons from Kosovo. In its latest report, the Commission observed that Kosovo had taken important steps towards fulfilling the requirement of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and fulfilled sufficient elements of building up its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Based on this assessment and given the outcome of the continuous monitoring and reporting that had been carried out since the launch of the visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo, the Commission confirms that Kosovo has met the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap on the understanding that by the day of the adoption of this proposal by the European Parliament and the Council, Kosovo will have ratified the border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. CONTENT: taking account of all the criteria which should be considered when determining on a case-by-case basis the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (as introduced by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014), the Commission has decided to present a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Kosovo from Annex I, Part 2 (visa-required list) to Annex II, Part 4 (visa-free list). A footnote will be added specifying that the visa exemption will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents (Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004). Territorial provisions : the proposed regulation will constitute a development of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and shall not be bound by it or subject to its application. The amended Regulation will be directly applicable from the date of its entry into force and will be implemented immediately by Member States. No implementation plan is necessary. The Commission will continue to actively monitor Kosovo’s process of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and the development of its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. (*) This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the unprecedented experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that the EU’s ability to coordinate work to ensure the availability of medicinal products and medical devices and facilitate their development is currently limited. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem of shortages for certain medicinal products considered as critical in addressing the pandemic, and has highlighted the structural limitations in the EU’s ability to rapidly and effectively react to such challenges during public health crises. The proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to reinforce the crisis preparedness and response and enhance the role of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Together, they form part of the EU’s overall health response to COVID-19 as well as an improved crisis management framework. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation should develop the core tasks already given to the EMA to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products with the potential to address public health emergencies. It would complement the measures directed at improving the overall EU crisis management framework by addressing the specific issues related to medicinal product and medical device sectors and the tasks of the Agency. It would thus introduce new rules for the Agency with the objective to provide mechanisms within the Agency to: monitor and mitigate the risk of shortages of critical medicines and medical devices; provide scientific advice on medicines which may have the potential to treat, prevent or diagnose the diseases causing those crises; coordinate studies to monitor the effectiveness and safety of vaccines; coordinate clinical trials. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications should relate mainly to administrative, scientific and IT support."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: market abuse harms the integrity of financial markets and public confidence in securities and derivatives. Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) completed and updated the Union's legal framework to protect market integrity. The European Commission has assessed the application of the Directive and has identified a number of problems which have negative impacts in terms of market integrity and investor protection, lead to an uneven playing field and result in compliance costs and disincentives for issuers, whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on SME growth markets, to raise capital. The main problems are as follows: market and technological developments , gaps in the regulation of new markets, platforms and over the counter instruments have emerged. Similarly, these same factors have led to gaps in the regulation of commodities and related derivatives. regulators lack certain information and powers , and sanctions are either lacking or insufficiently dissuasive, which mean that regulators cannot effectively enforce the Directive; lastly, the existence of numerous options and discretions in the Directive, as well as a lack of clarity on certain key concepts, undermines the effectiveness of the Directive. The importance of market integrity has been highlighted by the current global economic and financial crisis. In line with the G20 findings, the report by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU recommended that a sound prudential and conduct of business framework for the financial sector must rest on strong supervisory and sanctioning regimes. In its Communication on ""Ensuring efficient, safe and sound derivatives markets: Future policy actions"" the Commission undertook to extend relevant provisions of the Directive in order to cover derivatives markets in a comprehensive fashion. Furthermore, a review of existing sanctioning powers and their practical application aimed at promoting convergence of sanctions across the range of supervisory activities has been carried out in the Commission Communication on sanctions in the financial services sector. The Directive should now be replaced to ensure that it keeps pace with developments in the market, given the legislative, market and technological developments that have resulted in considerable changes to the financial landscape. The aim is to increase market integrity and investor protection, while ensuring a single rulebook and level playing field and increasing the attractiveness of securities markets for raising capital. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the initiative is the result of extensive consultations with all major stakeholders, including public authorities (governments and securities regulators), issuers, intermediaries and investors. The Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options related to: (i) regulation of new markets, platforms and OTC instruments, commodities and related derivatives; (ii) sanctions, (iii) powers of competent authorities; (iii) clarification of key concepts and (iv) reducing administrative burdens. The overall impact of all the preferred policy options will lead to considerable improvements in addressing market abuse within the EU. This will be done through: improving market integrity and investor protection by clarifying which financial instruments and markets are covered, ensuring that instruments admitted to trading only on a multilateral trading facility (MTF) and other new types of organised trading facilities (OTFs) are covered; improving protection against market abuse through commodity derivatives by improved market transparency ; ensuring better detection of market abuse by offering the necessary powers to competent authorities to perform investigations and improve the deterrence of sanctioning regimes by introducing minimum principles for administrative measures or sanctions; a more coherent approach regarding market abuse by reducing options and discretions for Member States; introducing a proportionate regime for issuers , whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on SME growth markets. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to establish a common regulatory framework on market abuse to ensure the integrity of financial markets in the Union and to enhance investor protection and confidence in those markets. Scope : the development of new platforms, new technologies such as high frequency trading and an increase in trading across different venues has made it more difficult to monitor for possible market abuse. The proposal: extends the scope of the market abuse framework applying to any financial instrument admitted to trading on a MTF or an OTF, as well as to any related financial instruments traded OTC which can have an effect on the covered underlying market; specifies further specific examples of strategies using algorithmic trading and high frequency trading, such as quote stuffing, layering and spoofing, that fall within the prohibition against market manipulation; extends the scope of the Directive so that the general definition of inside information in relation to financial markets and commodity derivatives should also apply to all information which is relevant to the related commodity; expressly prohibits attempts at market manipulation, which will enhance market integrity; reclassifies emission allowances as financial instruments as part of the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. As a result, they will also fall into the scope of the market abuse framework. Inside information : the state of contract negotiations, terms provisionally agreed in contract negotiations, the possibility of the placement of financial instruments, conditions under which financial instruments will be marketed, or provisional terms for the placement of financial instruments may be relevant information for investors. Therefore, such information should qualify as inside information. Public disclosure of inside information: in accordance with the proposal, issuers will be required to inform the competent authorities of their decision to delay the disclosure of inside information immediately after such a disclosure is made. The responsibility for assessing whether such delay is justified remains with the issuer. Competent authorities will have the power to investigate ex post whether in fact the specific conditions for the delay were met will increase investor protection and market integrity; the market abuse framework is adapted to the characteristics and needs of issuers, whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on SME growth markets. Issuers are exempt, under certain conditions, from the obligation to keep and constantly update insiders' lists, and benefit from the new threshold for the reporting of manager's transactions mentioned below. The proposal introduces a threshold of EUR 20 000, uniform in all Member States, which triggers the obligation to report such manager's transactions. ESMA and Competent Authorities: the proposed regulation allows competent authorities access to continuous data by requiring such data to be directly submitted to them in a specified format. By gaining access to spot commodity market traders' systems, competent authorities are also able to monitor real-time data flows; competent authorities will be able to require existing telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunication operator or by an investment firm, or to have access to private premises and seize documents, where a reasonable suspicion exists that such records related to the subject-matter of the inspection may be relevant to prove insider dealing or market manipulation as defined in the proposal; as market abuse can take place across borders and different markets, ESMA has a strong coordination role and competent authorities are required to cooperate and exchange information with other competent authorities and, when applicable to commodity derivatives, with the regulatory authorities responsible for the related spot markets, within the Union and in third countries. Sanctions : this Regulation introduces minimum rules for administrative measures, sanctions and fines. This does not prevent individual Member States from fixing higher standards. The proposal provides for the disgorgement of any profits where identified, including interests, and, in order to ensure an appropriate deterrent effect, it introduces fines which must exceed any profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the violation of this Regulation. Moreover, criminal sanctions have a stronger deterrent effect than administrative measures and sanctions. The proposal for a Directive on sanctions introduces the requirement for all Member States to put in place effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions for the most serious insider dealing and market manipulation offences. Protection and incentives for whistleblowers : the regulation enhances the market abuse framework in the Union introducing appropriate protection for whistleblowers reporting suspected market abuse, the possibility of financial incentives for persons who provide competent authorities with salient information that leads to a monetary sanction, and enhancements of Member States' provisions for receiving and reviewing whistleblowing notifications. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to task allocated to ESMA. Total appropriations are estimated at EUR 832 000 from 2013 to 2015. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU."
9917EP8,"""""Framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties """"",0.743,0.769,0.86,0.125,0.038,0.851,0.812,0.019,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to safeguard financial stability by establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties. LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a central counterparty (CCP) acts as the intermediary to both sides of a transaction in a financial instrument, including bonds, equities, derivatives and commodities (such as agricultural products, oil and natural gas). The importance of CCPs has nearly doubled since the post-crisis G20 commitment to clear standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives through CCPs. This obligation is implemented in the EU by the Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (‘EMIR’). That Regulation also sets out comprehensive prudential requirements for CCPs, as well as requirements regarding the operations and oversight of CCPs. However, no harmonised EU rules exist for the unlikely situations in which CCPs would face severe distress – beyond that envisaged by EMIR – or outright failure. Recovery and resolution measures are required in order to safeguard financial stability, ensure the continuity of critical functions and protect taxpayers. The tools currently available to Member State authorities are inadequate to deal with CCPs that face significant stress. In December 2013 the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to propose appropriate EU measures to ensure that the impacts of a potential failure of key financial institutions, most notably CCPs, could be mitigated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this concluded that EU action is necessary given the cross-border nature of CCPs' business, which links multiple financial actors, counterparties and clients throughout the single market. CONTENT: the draft regulation lays down rules and procedures relating to the recovery and resolution of CCPs authorised in accordance with EMIR Regulation. It also lays down rules relating to the arrangements with third countries in the field of recovery and resolution of CCPs. It sets out provisions comparable to those in the EMIR framework applicable to banks and investment firms to facilitate orderly recovery and resolution but adapts them to the specific features of CCPs. Objectives : these are: first, to seek the orderly recovery of CCPs in various scenarios of financial distress through the implementation of recovery plans that are agreed between the CCP and its clearing members; if this were to be insufficient, authorities should take swift action in order to safeguard financial stability. Set-up of resolution authorities and resolution colleges : resolution authorities for CCPs shall be set up and equipped with a harmonised set of powers to undertake all the relevant preparatory and resolution actions. Furthermore, CCPs’ resolution authorities are required to set up resolution colleges for each CCP containing all the relevant authorities including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European banking Authority (EBA). Preparation – recovery plans : CCPs are required to prepare recovery plans to overcome any form of financial distress which would exceed their default management resources and other requirements under EMIR. Preparation – resolution plans and resolvability assessments : resolution authorities are required to prepare resolution plans for how CCPs would be restructured and their critical functions kept alive in the event of their failure. The plans should outline the resolution powers and tools which authorities would employ in case a CCP meets the conditions for resolution. Early intervention : this will ensure that financial difficulties are addressed as soon as they arise and problems can be averted. Competent authorities are granted specific powers to intervene in the operations of CCPs where their viability is at risk but before they reach the point of failure. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
9255EP8,"""""Cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters""""",0.757,0.774,0.84,0.854,0.212,0.866,0.775,0.577,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve the smooth functioning of the area of freedom, security and justice, and of the internal market, by increasing the efficiency and speed of the cross-border taking of evidence. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the area of justice requires judicial cooperation across borders. For this purpose, and to facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market, the EU adopted Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters and Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence. These instruments are crucial in the regulation of judicial assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Member States. In 2018, approximately 3.4 million civil and commercial court proceedings in the EU have cross-border implications. In many such proceedings, there is a need to obtain evidence from another Member State; the Regulation on the taking of evidence provides tools that facilitate access to that evidence. In 2017, to support relevant, comprehensive and up-to-date analysis and conclusions on the practical operation of the Regulation, the Commission undertook a regulatory fitness (REFIT) evaluation. The findings showed that contacts between the bodies designated by the Regulation are still almost exclusively paper-based, with adverse impacts on cost and effectiveness. Also, videoconferencing is rarely used to hear persons in another Member State. The proposal therefore addresses the need for modernisation, in particular digitalisation and the use of modern technology in the cross-border taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters. It also addresses the following other problems highlighted by the evaluation: delays and costs for citizens, businesses and Member States, shortcomings in the protection of procedural rights and legal complexity and uncertainty. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal amending the Regulation on cross-border service. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a policy package involving a number of measures: using electronic transmission as the default channel for electronic communication and document exchanges; promoting modern means of taking evidence such as videoconferencing if a person needs to be heard from another Member State and incentives (via the financing of national projects) for Member States to equip courts with videoconferencing facilities; removing legal barriers to the acceptance of electronic (digital) evidence; tackling divergent interpretations of the term ‘court’; raising courts’ and legal professionals’ awareness of the availability of the direct channel of taking evidence under the Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal aims to improve the efficiency and speed of obtaining cross-border evidence. To this end, it adapts Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 to technical developments, exploiting the advantages of digitisation and ensuring greater use of videoconferencing. In concrete terms, the proposed amendments: define the term ‘court’ to mean any judicial authority in a Member State which is competent for the performance of taking of evidence according to this Regulation; introduce the mandatory electronic transmission, as a rule, of requests and communications. In exceptional cases, i.e. where the system is interrupted or not suitable for the transmission in question (e.g. transmission of a DNA sample as evidence), other channels can still be used; ensure a more appropriate, more frequent and faster use of direct taking of evidence via videoconference, where available to the courts in question and appropriate in the light of the specific circumstances of the case; facilitate the taking of evidence by diplomatic officers or consular agents. The Article provides that such persons may, in the territory of another Member State and in the area where they exercise their functions, take evidence without the need for a prior request, by hearing nationals of the Member State which they represent without compulsion in the context of proceedings pending in the courts of that Member State; ensure that digital evidence taken in accordance with the law of the Member State where it was taken is not rejected as evidence in other Member States solely due to its digital nature. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not impose significant costs on national administrations, but rather lead to savings. Costs relating to the development, implementation and maintenance of electronic communication and document exchanges, and to the acquisition, implementation and operation of professional, high-end videoconferencing equipment could be co-funded. The main EU funding opportunities under the current financial programmes are the Justice programme and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package for the digital transformation priority, as unveiled on 2 May 2018, includes EUR 3 billion for a digital strand of the CEF, to finance digital connectivity infrastructure."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the Republic of Moldova have developed a close political and economic relationship over the years. The last Association Agenda for 2017-2019 has been extended over the period of one year (due to the pandemic last year), whilst a new document is under preparation, covering the 2021-2027 period. Moldova's economic ties with the EU are also well developed. The EU continues to be Moldova’s largest trading partner, accounting for 52% of its total trade in 2020. Moldova’s economy has been affected significantly by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the protracted political stalemate in the country after the Presidential elections in November 2020, as well as the recent energy crisis. The situation contributed to Moldova’s sizable financing gap, deteriorating external position, and growing fiscal needs. Following the election in July 2021, the new Moldovan government has demonstrated a strong commitment to further reforms, with an ambitious programme ‘Moldova in good times 2021-2025’, focusing on key policy areas including, among others, justice sector reforms, fight against corruption, good governance and the rule of law. With the renewed reform-commitment and strong political will, the authorities have significantly accelerated on reform implementation, which has also allowed Moldova to successfully complete the COVID-19 macro-financial assistance operation. In view of a worsening economic situation and outlook, Moldova requested a complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union in November 2021. The proposed MFA would help Moldova cover part of its residual external financing needs, which are estimated at USD 480 million, in the context of the new IMF programme over the period of 2021-2025. Given that Moldova is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. CONTENT: the Union will provide macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 150 million available to Moldova, with a view to supporting Moldova's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda. Of that maximum amount, up to EUR 120 million will be provided in the form of loans and up to EUR 30 million in the form of grants. The loans will have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Moreover, the assistance will contribute to covering Moldova's balance of payments needs as identified in the IMF programme. The Commission is considering releasing the assistance in three instalments: - the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2022; - the second instalment could be disbursed in early 2023; - the third tranche could follow later that year or in the first half of 2024, provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. It should be noted that a pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance will be that Moldova respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. The proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. They Commission should regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of developments relating to MFA. Budgetary implications The financial programming of the EUR 150 million assistance over the 2022-2024 period allows for a grant component of EUR 30 million to be financed from the available budget on budget line 14 20 03 01 ‘Macro-financial assistance (MFA) – grants’'. For the loan component of EUR 120 million, the required provisioning at a rate of 9% of the External Action Guarantee will be programmed under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 10.8 million (budget line 14 02 01 70 ‘NDICI – Provisioning of the Common Provisioning Fund’)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom of Union citizens and one of the pillars of the internal market in the Union enshrined in Article 45 of the TFEU. Article 46 sets out the measures to bring about this freedom, in particular by ensuring close cooperation between the Public Employment Services ('PES'). The free movement of workers is a key element to the development of a more integrated Union labour market which allows worker mobility from high unemployment areas to areas characterised by labour shortages. It also contributes to finding the right skills for vacant positions and overcoming bottlenecks in the labour market. Only approximately 7.5 million of the European labour force of around 241 million (i.e. 3.1%) is economically active in another Member State. At present, high unemployment rates in some Member States coexist with high numbers of open job vacancies in others. There are many reasons why the potential for intra-EU labour mobility remains untapped and individual citizens do not realise their intentions to become mobile workers. The most common practical difficulties expected or encountered are the lack of relevant language knowledge and the difficulties in finding a job. The EU can contribute to addressing the latter by raising awareness on employment opportunities across the Union and developing appropriate support services to encourage intra-EU recruitments. The provisions of Regulation 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on freedom of movement for workers within the Union (codification) established mechanisms for clearance and for information exchange and the Commission Implementing Decision 2012/733/EU has laid down provisions on the functioning of a network entitled EURES (European Employment Services) in accordance with that Regulation. Whereas the functioning of the EURES network was subject to some changes at the initiative of the Commission through its 2012 Decision, the Chapter II of Regulation 492/2011 which constitutes the European regulatory framework for the clearance and information exchange between Member States on intra-EU labour mobility has not been amended since 1992. This regulatory framework needs to be revised to reflect new mobility patterns, enhanced requirements for fair mobility, changes in the technology for sharing job vacancy data, the use of a variety of recruitment channels by job seekers and employers and the increasing role of other labour market brokers next to the Public Employment Services ('PES') in the provision of recruitment services. A common framework for cooperation should be established between Member States and the Commission on labour mobility within the Union. This framework should bring together job vacancies from across the Union and the possibility of applying for those job vacancies ('clearance'), define the provision of related support services to workers and employers and provide for a common approach to share information necessary to facilitate said co-operation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives to address shortcomings: Option 1 : no new options, Option 2 : amending Regulation 492/2011 as regards the powers of the Commission on the implementation of its provisions (Lisbonisation), Option 3 : introducing a new Regulation with new provisions altogether (modernisation of EURES) , Option 4 : introducing a new Regulation with a specific Commission mandate to increase the co-operation between public and private employment services. Option 3 is the preferred option which should replace Regulation 492/2011 and the 2012 Decision with a stand-alone instrument combining the provisions of the two instruments. Within this option, a number of specific alternatives were discarded as not being proportionate to the specific objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 46 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to enhance access of workers to intra-EU labour mobility support services, thus supporting fair mobility and increasing access to employment opportunities throughout the Union. It replaces the provisions on the exchange of information on job vacancies, job applications and CV’s across Member States (“clearance”) found currently in Regulation 492/2011. It also (re)establishes the European network of Employment Services, called EURES, the purpose of which will be to provide assistance with job search and recruitment across Member States. A similar network is active today on the basis of the 2012 Commission Decision. Therefore, upon adoption of this Regulation, the Commission will repeal the above Decision on the functioning of the current EURES network. In this context, the Commission recently introduced a proposal to establish a network of PES to deepen cooperation and mutual learning. That network will cover a wider range of objectives and initiatives in the form of incentives and is complementary to this proposal. Objectives : the general objective is to make the EURES network an effective instrument for any job seeker or employer interested in intra-EU labour mobility. Shortcomings have been identified in the functioning of the EURES network (such as an incomplete pool of job vacancies and CVs; limited automated matching potential; insufficient support services and cross-border information on labour). The specific objectives of the proposal address these shortcomings: to achieve on the EURES portal a nearly complete supply of job vacancies, with job seekers all over Europe having instant access to the same vacancies, in combination with an extensive pool of CV’s available from which registered employers can recruit; to enable the EURES portal to carry out a good automated matching between job vacancies and CV’s across Member States, translating in all EU languages and understanding skills, competences, qualifications and occupations acquired at national and sectoral level; to make available basic information about the EURES network throughout the Union to any job seeker or employer seeking client services for recruitment and to consistently offer any person interested access to the EURES network; to assist any such person interested with matching, placement and recruitment through the EURES network; to support the functioning of the EURES network through information exchange on national labour shortages and surpluses and the coordination of actions across Member States. More specifically, the proposal seeks to: integrate into a single framework the provisions of chapter II and Article 38 of Regulation 492/2011 and the Commission Decision 733/2012/EU on the EURES network. There may also be a possibility to extend the scope of the EURES network to cover apprenticeships and traineeships; re-establish the EURES network as well as laying down the new terms and conditions as regards its composition and membership. A single governance body to facilitate practical co-operation between Commission and Member States for this Regulation shall be set up; introduce specific measures on transparency and automated matching; introduce the specific measures on mainstreaming and support services. The proposal explicitly supports the extension of the delivery of support services by organisations other than the PES, in principle through the voluntary participation in the EURES network by EURES Partners. In addition, PES are encouraged to develop partnerships to promote a coherent service package to employers as regards intra-EU labour mobility. One specific form of these support structures are cross-border partnerships; reinforce the existing arrangements for sharing information in the EURES network where it benefits the quality of concrete collective outputs or the coordination of policies of Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not result in any specific budgetary impact for the EU budget. Any activities to be carried out by the European Commission for the EURES network which will result in the need for human and/or financial resources fall under the scope of the Regulation establishing the Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (""EaSI"") (2014-2020) and will be covered within the annual budgetary allocation of this programme. For the period 2014-2020, this EU programme will pay for horizontal measures such as the EURES portal, the common training programme, targeted mobility schemes like Your first EURES Job and the development of the European classification for skills/competences, qualifications and occupations (ESCO). For the same period, activities in Member States on intra-EU labour mobility are eligible under the European Social Fund. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 42, first subparagraph and Article 43(2) TFEU. CONTENT: Articles 290 and 291 TFEU establish a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts and, on the other, the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts: Article 290 TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as delegated acts; Article 291 TFEU requires Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to as implementing acts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no need for an impact assessment since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to align Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to the new requirements of Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. The proposal is based on a careful qualification of the existing Commission powers under Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as ""delegated"" and ""implementing"". This was done against the background of the implementing measures adopted by the Commission on the basis of its current powers. With regard to Article 290 TFEU , a Commission delegated act may determine the additional elements necessary for the proper functioning of the common market organisation established by the Legislator. For example, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in order to lay down the conditions for operators for taking part in a scheme, the obligations deriving from the issue of a licence and, if necessary depending on the economic situation, whether it requires a guarantee for issue of licences. Similarly, the Legislator delegates to the Commission the power to adopt measures to establish eligibility criteria for products as regards market intervention. In addition, the Commission may adopt delegated acts regarding definitions. With regard to Article 291 TFEU , the proposal specifies that in order to ensure that the CMO is implemented in Member States in a uniform manner and to avoid unfair competition or discrimination between operators, the Commission will be able to adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 291(2) of the Treaty. The Commission will, therefore, be granted implementing powers under that provision, in particular as regards the uniform conditions under which market intervention measures apply, the uniform conditions for implementing aid schemes and for applying rules concerning marketing and production, and rules related to trade with Third countries. The Commission should also define the minimum characteristics for checks which Member States must apply. In this proposal, the Commission also deals with Council powers under Article 43(3) TFEU. This provision stipulates that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aids and quantitative limitations. The provision forms an exception to Article 43(2) TFEU which requires the ordinary legislative procedure to be used to establish the common organisation of agricultural markets and the other provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common agricultural policy. This reflects the general trend in the Lisbon Treaty which has turned the ordinary legislative procedure into the standard procedure for the adoption of EU legislative acts. As an exception Article 43(3) TFEU needs to be interpreted restrictively so as to ensure that the Legislator can exercise its legislative prerogatives under Article 43(2) TFEU. This includes the Legislator regulating the fundamental elements of the common agricultural policy and taking the political decisions that shape its structure, instruments and effects. Against this background the specific procedure laid down in Art. 43(3) TFEU should only be applied where an issue referred to in that provision does not form part of the fundamental policy decisions reserved to the Legislator under Article 43(2) TFEU. Therefore, where such an issue is inextricably linked with the political substance of the decisions to be taken by the Legislator, Article 43(3) TFEU should not be applied. Consequently, the proposal is based on the following principles: the structural parameters and fundamental elements of the CAP may only be decided by the Legislator. For example, the public intervention (including the framework for the determination by the Commission of certain intervention prices by means of the tendering procedure) and milk and sugar quota schemes established by Regulation 1234/2007 should be decided by the Legislator, as these elements are inextricably linked to the definition of the content of the scheme established by the Legislator and the boundaries of this regime; measures on fixing prices, levies, aids and quantitative limitations as referred to in Article 43(3) which do not fall in the scope of Article 43(2) TFEU shall be taken by the Council. The Commission will submit a proposal for a Regulation based on Article 43(3) TFEU as regards the provisions in Article 21 on the conditions for mandatory aid for private storage of butter, in Article 99 on the production refund in the sugar sector, in Articles 101 and 102 on aids in the milk and milk products sector, in Article 108 on the supply of milk products to pupils, in Article 155 on aids in the silkworm sector, in Article 273 on export refunds and in Article 281 on live plants minimum export prices. The proposed Regulations will, in respect of these provisions, provide that the conditions for fixing of aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should be determined by the Council under Article 43(3) TFEU and that amounts of such aids, refunds and price levels should be fixed by the Commission by means of implementing acts. The Commission will submit the proposals that need to be made with regard to Article 43(3) TFEU in due course to the Council. Lastly, the content of the following proposals is integrated into this proposal: European Parliament legislative resolution of 23 November on the proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation) as regards the aid granted in the framework of the German Alcohol Monopoly; proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007, as regards distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union; proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards marketing standards; proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."
2202EP7,"""""Engines placed on the market under the flexibility scheme""""",0.702,0.883,0.053,0.548,0.242,0.88,0.841,0.743,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 97/68/EC and adapt the rules applicable to the flexibility scheme provided for in that directive in order to extend the application of that scheme to engines for use in propulsion of railcars and locomotives. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it is recalled that Directive 97/68/EC regulates the maximum exhaust emissions carbon oxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates (PM) from diesel engines installed in construction, agricultural and forestry machinery, railcars & locomotives, inland waterway vessels, constant speed engines and small petrol engines used in different types of machinery. The Directive provides for emissions limit stages of increasing stringency with corresponding compliance dates. Manufacturers must ensure that new engines comply with these limits in order that they can be placed on the market. Directive 2004/26/EC introduced the current applicable stage of emission limits for the majority of diesel engines referred to as Stage III A. These limits will be replaced by the more stringent Stage III B limits progressively as of 1st January 2011. The type approval period for these engines started on 1 January 2010. A great diversity of machinery production (approximately 1500 companies in the EU) is affected. To comply with Stage III B limits, current engines will need to be substantially modified. Changes to the configuration, size or weight of engines have a knock-on effect for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) who will have to adapt the design of their machines in order to accommodate the modified engines. This process can only start once the engine is fully developed. Technical solutions for complying III B engines are not yet finalised. Thus, OEMs are not in a position to fully redesign the machinery where the engine is to be installed. In addition, compliance costs for manufacturers to cope with the new emission limits are significant. Directive 2004/26/EC also introduced the flexibility scheme to facilitate the transition between the different emission stages. The flexibility scheme allows the OEM to place on the market, during the period between two successive stages of exhaust emissions limit values, a limited number of non-road mobile machines which are fitted with engines that still comply with the exhaust emission limits of the previous stage. The flexibility scheme applies to compression ignition (diesel) engines used in construction, agricultural and forestry machinery, generator sets and pumps using constant speed engines, but not to locomotives, railcars and inland waterway vessels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a detailed Impact Assessment has been carried out on the basis of technical studies and a stakeholder consultation. It covers the different scenarios for engines covered by the existing flexibility scheme and identifies the need to include railcars. In addition to the conclusions of the Impact Assessment, locomotives have been added to the flexibility scheme. The Impact Assessment analyses different options ranging from the implementation of a scrapping scheme, variations of the flexibility scheme as regards the allowed percentage/number of engines to the set-up of a trading system whereby firms that would not use the entire flexibility could sell their flexibility rights to firms that need additional flexibility. The use of a scrapping scheme has been discarded as it is not suitable for assisting OEMs in financing R&D to make Stage III B machinery available. The set-up of a flexibility trading system was considered as a too complex system in a short time scale and thus disproportionate to the expected results. The option of increasing the existing flexibility scheme and extending it to sectors not yet included has been considered as the best option, balancing the environmental impact and an economic benefit in saved compliance costs for a limited period of time. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. the proposal makes the following amendments to Directive 97/68/EC: CONTENT: it is proposed to modify the provisions of the flexibility scheme to mitigate further the economic costs of the transition of emission Stages III A to III B by extending its application for some type of non-road mobile machinery while maintaining the entry into force of the exhaust emission limit Stage III B to preserve the objective of the Directive of reducing emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants in the Union. In addition, some engine manufacturers have progressed in developing compliant IIIB engines for locomotives while OEMs will yet not be entirely ready to place III B compliant locomotives on the market by 1st January 2012 as provided for in the Directive Therefore it appeared necessary to apply the flexibility scheme also to locomotives. The main amendments to the Directive are as follows: an increase of the percentage of the number of engines used for application in land based machines, placed on the market under the flexibility scheme in each engine category from 20% to 50% of the OEM’s annual sales of equipment and an adaptation of the maximum number of engines that may be placed on the market under the flexibility scheme as an optional alternative, in the period between emission Stage III A to emission Stage III B; inclusion of engines used for the propulsion of railcars and locomotives in the flexibility scheme providing the possibility for the OEM to place on the market a limited number of engines under the flexibility scheme; these measures will expire on 31 December 2013. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."
2108EP7,"""""Public regulated service offered by the global navigation satellite system established under the Galileo programme""""",0.807,0.868,0.035,0.452,0.152,0.94,0.851,0.229,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down the detailed rules under which the Member States, the Council, the Commission, the European Union agencies and international organisations may access the public regulated service (PRS) offered by the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) established under the Galileo programme.  PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 lays down the conditions for the further implementation of the two European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo). It provides that the system to be established under the Galileo programme will offer five services, including a ""public regulated service"" (PRS), restricted to government-authorised users, for sensitive applications which require a high level of service continuity. They specify that the PRS uses strong, encrypted signals. The PRS is a service to which the general public will not have access and which is restricted exclusively to the Council, the Commission, Member States and, where appropriate, duly authorised European Union agencies, non-member countries and international organisations. Its use must be monitored for safety and security reasons, unlike the other unsecured services which will be offered by the two European GNSS systems. It is therefore essential to monitor users by means such as establishing an authorisation procedure, using encryption keys, receiver approval, etc. Moreover, certain applications of the service may be politically and strategically very sensitive. The characteristics of the PRS as a whole necessitate a precise legislative definition of the detailed rules for access to the PRS. Furthermore, in its conclusions adopted on 12 October 2006, the Transport Council asked the Commission to actively pursue its work on the drawing up of the PRS access policy and to present its proposals in due time for the Council's deliberation and approval. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: although it has not formally been the subject of an impact assessment, the draft text is nonetheless the result of very thorough preparatory work which closely involved the various stakeholders interested in the PRS, particularly the Member States, which will be the key participants in this service. The various matters relating to the detailed rules for access to the PRS were carefully discussed by the Security Board, known as the GSB, which was established under Council Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 and repealed under Regulation (EC) No 683/2008. It should crucially be underlined that during the preparatory work carried out by the GSB, the whole range of different possible schemes was carefully considered: take no action; no monitoring of PRS users by the Member States. This option would also have been incompatible with the high level of security required for the PRS. It could not be considered in view of the sensitivity of the subject and its security implications for the Member States and the European Union; entirely centralised management at European Union level of all authorisation standards and procedures, approval and monitoring relating to the detailed rules for access to the PRS, in particular manufacture of receivers and distribution of access-protection keys; conversely, entirely decentralised management of the same components at Member State level. Under the scheme adopted, the technical functions directly connected to the infrastructure are centralised at European level through the activities of the security centre used by the European GNSS Agency; conversely, the participant supervisory functions are decentralised at national level in order to take account of local constraints. The Decision which is the subject of this proposal is likely to have an impact on the Member States, European Union bodies, international organisations and non-member countries and industrial companies. The many discussions which have taken place since 2007 within the various bodies responsible for the security of the programmes and systems have merely confirmed the consensus on the various solutions chosen in the draft. It is important to remember that, in view of their sensitive nature, matters relating to use of the PRS involve not only system security but also the security of the Member States themselves. It has for that reason proved to be politically and practically impossible for the Member States to reach a consensus on the options selected. Recourse to Joint Action 2004/552/CFSP, which falls under the unanimity rule, is furthermore explicitly provided for by the draft in any cases where the security of the European Union and its Member States could be undermined. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Although the text may have implications for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, it must nonetheless be adopted under the procedures provided for under the TFEU pursuant to the Court of Justice's case law resulting from the Judgment of 20 May 2008, C-91/05 (Commission of the European Communities v. Council of the European Union), known as ""Small arms"". CONTENT: this draft Decision lays down the detailed rules under which the Member States, the Council, the Commission, the European Union agencies and international organisations may access the public regulated service (PRS) offered by the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) established under the Galileo programme.  It contains the following key measures: general principles on the detailed rules for access to the PRS, in particular the fact that the Council, the Commission and the Member States have unlimited, uninterrupted access to the PRS anywhere in the world, while an agreement would be required to grant access to the PRS to European Union agencies, non-member countries and international organisations; the requirement for PRS participants to designate a ""Competent PRS Authority"" to manage and monitor manufacture, ownership and use of PRS receivers, and the establishment of minimum common standards to which the competent PRS authorities must comply; the establishment of a framework of conditions for the manufacture and security of PRS receivers; provisions on export control, control centres worldwide, and the implementation of joint actions under the “second pillar”. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no direct negative impact on the European Union budget; in particular, it does not commit the European Union to any new policy and the various EU supervisory bodies to which it refers have already been established by means of other texts."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to ensure connectivity between the EU and the UK after the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 126 of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and to guarantee the continuity of the activities of railway undertakings established and licensed in the UK operating on the cross-Channel fixed link, Regulation (EU) 2020/2222 established measures to ensure the continuity of EU cross-border rail services with the UK. Regulation (EU) 2020/2222: - extended until 30 September 2021 the period of validity of the licences issued by the United Kingdom to rail operators established in its territory, as well as that of the safety certificates issued to those undertakings by the Intergovernmental Commission established pursuant to the Treaty between the UK and France concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a channel fixed link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 (the ‘Treaty of Canterbury’); - extended the period of validity of the safety authorisation of the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager issued by the said Intergovernmental Commission until 28 February 2021. Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council empowers France and the United Kingdom to conclude an international agreement concerning the construction and operation of a Channel Fixed Link (‘the Treaty of Canterbury’) as regards the application of railway safety rules within the Channel Fixed Link. However, no agreement has been concluded yet or is likely to be concluded soon. In this context, France and the UK have negotiated a cross-border agreement on safety certificates. France has also negotiated a cross-border agreement on the licensing of railway undertakings. Additional time is needed to complete the formal procedures required under the law of both Parties for the provisional application or entry into force of these agreements. These procedures are expected to extend for six months after the expiry, on 30 September 2021, of the contingency measures currently in force. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/2222 aims to extend the contingency measures concerning the validity of licences and safety certificates in order to ensure the continuity of operations on the Channel fixed link. The end of the proposed extension is 31 March 2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 transferred 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19 countries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. Colombia and Peru were, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the Commission could present to the Council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. In October 2014, the Commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of Colombia. The Commission concluded that the significant improvement of the Colombian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that Colombians should be granted visa-free access to the Member States' territory. In addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the Union. In March 2015, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with Colombia and Peru. On 19 May 2015, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations with Colombia were opened on 20 May 2015 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 June 2015. The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Colombia on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Colombia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Colombia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Colombia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Colombia remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Biometric passports: the Agreement includes a number of declarations: Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Colombia to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."
858EP9,"""""Request for urgent procedure - Specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector""""",1.0,0.951,0.892,0.699,0.614,0.935,0.916,0.854,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to adopt specific measures to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the fisheries and aquaculture sector. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fishery and aquaculture sector has been particularly hard hit by the market disruption generated by a significant drop in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis can consequently have dramatic socio-economic consequences in certain communities where fishing and aquaculture play a key role. Small-scale coastal fisheries represent close to 75% of all active vessels and over 55% of direct employment; they constitute the main economic activity in many coastal areas. On 13 March 2020, the Commission proposed a ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’ directed at promoting investments by mobilising available cash reserves in the European Structural and Investments Funds, to fight the crisis immediately. However, the fact that fishing and aquaculture activities have been interrupted or significantly reduced makes it difficult to implement the current operational measures and programmes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) in a normal way. In the absence of effective measures to tackle the crisis, the EMFF is unlikely to be fully implemented by the end of the current programming period. The Commission considers that it should be possible for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) established by Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 to support specific measures until 31 December 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (EMFF Regulation) and Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 (CMO Regulation) in order to introduce specific measures under the EMFF to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Specific measures The amendments to the EMFF are intended to allow a more flexible redistribution of financial resources within operational programmes in each Member State and a simplified procedure for amending operational programmes as regards the introduction of new measures. The proposed specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector comprise: - support to fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to aquaculture farmers for the temporary suspension or the reduction of production caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to producer organisations and associations of producer organisations for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products, in accordance with the Common Market Organisation (CMO). It is proposed that these measures are retroactively eligible as of 1 February 2020 and available until 31 December 2020. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the EMFF remains unchanged. The available payment appropriations in the 2020 budget for the EMFF can accommodate a shift between Union Priorities within operational programmes. The new measures will in fact to a large extent replace initially planned initiatives, which are now being stopped due to the general decline of economic activity. By consequence, the proposed measures aim to ensure an effective implementation of the 2020 budget and the 2014-2020 allocation for the EMFF."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the digital single market strategy established a robust framework which must now be matched with an equally ambitious investment programme to increase the EU's international competitiveness, as well as to develop and strengthen Europe's strategic digital capacities. European Heads of State and Government identified the main pillars of a strong digital economy: cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, a world class infrastructure that includes high performance computing, digital skills, and the digital transformation of the public sector. In its resolution of 1 June 2017 on the digitising European industry, the European Parliament highlighted the importance of a common European cybersecurity approach, recognising the need to raise awareness and considered cyber-resilience as a crucial responsibility for business leaders and national and European industrial security policymakers. The digital Europe programme is a central element of the Commission's comprehensive response to the challenge of digital transformation, part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) proposal for 2021-2027. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the digital Europe programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021 - 2027, the forms of European Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The overall objective of the proposed programme is to support the digital transformation of the European economy and society and bring its benefits to European citizens and businesses. It shall reinforce Europe's capacities in key digital technology areas through large-scale deployment and widen their diffusion and uptake in areas of public interest and the private sector. The programme has five specific objectives: 1. high-performance computing : funding aims to build-up and strengthen the EU's high performance computing (HPC) and data processing capacities, and ensure their wide use both in areas of public interest such as health, environment and security, and by industry, notably SMEs. At EU level, in March 2017, 29 countries engaged to cooperate on connected mobility, and 16 Member States have committed so far to work together and with the Commission to acquire and deploy an integrated world-class high performance computing infrastructure. In January 2018, the Commission proposed a Council Regulation to establish the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking ‘EuroHPC’. The continuation of the Joint Undertaking is deemed to be the most effective instrument to implement the objectives of the EuroHPC initiative, in particular to coordinate national and European Union strategies and investments in high performance computing infrastructure and R&D; 2. cybersecurity : the programme shall contribute to the protection of the EU digital economy, society and democracies by promoting the EU cyber defence and cyber security industry, financing advanced cyber security equipment and infrastructure, and supporting the development of the necessary skills and knowledge. 3. artificial intelligence : the aim is to build-up and reinforce core artificial intelligence (AI) capacities such as a data resources and libraries of artificial intelligence algorithms and make them accessible to all businesses and public administrations, as well as reinforce and foster links between existing artificial intelligence testing and experimentation facilities in Member States; 4. advanced digital skills : the programme shall ensure that the current and future labour force can easily acquire advanced digital skills, notably in high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, by offering students, graduates, and existing workers the means to acquire and develop these skills, no matter where they are situated; 5. deployment, better use of digital capacities and interoperability : the objective is to expand the best use of digital capacities, notably high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, across the economy, in areas of public interest and society, including the deployment of interoperable solutions in areas of public interest and facilitate access to technology and knowhow for all businesses, notably SMEs. Digital innovation hubs : the proposal foresees a central role for digital innovation hubs in the implementation of the programme. A network of digital innovation hubs shall ensure the widest geographical coverage across Europe. The digital innovation hubs shall serve as access points to the latest digital capacities, including high performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, as well as other innovative technologies such as key enabling technologies, also available also in fablabs or citylabs. They shall act as single-entry points in accessing tested and validated technologies and promote open innovation. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the programme is set at EUR 9.2 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, its indicative distribution shall be as follows: high performance computing: up to EUR 2.7 billion; cybersecurity: up to EUR 2.5 billion; artificial intelligence: up to EUR 2 billion; advanced digital skills: up to EUR 700 million; digital capacity utilisation and interoperability: up to EUR 1.3 billion."

982EP7,"""""Amendment of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of those Communities""""",0.526,0.656,0.825,0.323,0.152,0.904,0.851,0.029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of those Communities to take account of the setting up of the European External Action Service (EEAS). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, created the office of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission. According to the Treaty, the High Representative and Vice-President is to be assisted by the European External Action Service (EEAS). Article 27(3) of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the EEAS is to work in cooperation with the diplomatic services of the Member States and is to comprise officials from relevant departments of the General Secretariat of the Council and of the Commission as well as staff seconded from national diplomatic services of the Member States. As is the case for all the institutions and bodies of the Union, the EEAS staffing and personnel policy will operate within the framework established by the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of those Communities. In order to allow the EEAS to operate, certain amendments to the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment are required. Apart from adaptations to the new terminology resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the proposed amendments are limited to what is necessary for the establishment and functioning of the EEAS. This proposal is one of the legislative measures that need to be adopted in that context. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 336 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to be operational right from its inception, the EEAS must have qualified and experienced staff at its disposal. The Regulation confirms that – where it is stipulated in the Council Decision establishing the EEAS that an entity from the Council or Commission organisation chart is transferred to the EEAS – the officials and temporary staff occupying posts in that entity and other staff assigned to that entity are transferred from their respective institutions to the EEAS. Equal treatment : a fundamental aspect of the EEAS is the equality of treatment between the sources of EEAS staffing. Selection procedures for posts will thus be open on an equal basis (as opposed to the current situation, where internal candidates, followed by inter-institutional candidates, have priority). Hence, the Appointing Authority will consider applications for vacant posts in the EEAS from different categories of staff – staff of national diplomatic services, officials of the Commission, the Council and the EEAS, as well as temporary staff of the EEAS from national diplomatic services – without giving any priority to any of them. After the start-up phase, but on 1 July 2013 at the latest, this facilitated access to vacant posts in the EEAS will be extended to officials of other institutions of the Union. In order to guarantee proper representation of staff from national diplomatic services in the EEAS, it should be possible, until 30 June 2013, to give priority to candidates from national diplomatic services of the Member States for AD posts in case of substantially equal qualifications. Specific category of temporary staff : staff will be employed by the EEAS as a specific category of temporary staff. For this particular category of temporary staff, certain rules (retirement age, possibility of secondment, and leave on personal grounds) are aligned to those applicable to officials. These staff members will thus benefit from the same working conditions as officials. Flexibility : officials of the EEAS who were officials of either the Council or the Commission before taking up their duties in the EEAS will be able to apply for vacant posts in their institution of origin on the same basis as officials inside those institutions. Their applications will thus be considered as applications from internal candidates. In exceptional circumstances, a transfer in the interests of the service, i.e. without prior publication of the post, from the EEAS to the Council or the Commission and vice versa will be made possible. Authority entrusted with powers : the EEAS will be treated as an institution for the purposes of the Staff Regulations. The High Representative and Vice-President will be the Appointing Authority for the staff of the EEAS (with a possibility to entrust EEAS staff members with these powers). Special arrangements are foreseen for cases where EEAS staff will have to perform functions on behalf of the Commission. In this respect they will have to take instructions from the Commission. Moreover, the Commission will be involved in the recruitment and evaluation of these members of staff, as well as in disciplinary matters. In addition, account is also taken of the situation of Commission officials working in Union delegations who will have to take instructions in certain areas from the Head of delegation (who will be an official or a temporary agent of the EEAS). Other technical measures : these concern Annex X to the Staff Regulations (applicable to staff serving in third countries), contract staff and local staff. They should improve the functioning of the Union delegations. The whole of Annex X (and not only certain provisions) will apply to contract staff serving in a third country, including Commission staff. Contract staff engaged to perform duties in delegations will be able to take part in the rotation between delegations and Headquarters. In order to ensure better gender balance in delegations, staff serving in third countries will be able to take parental leave while continuing to benefit from certain provisions of Annex X (accommodation provided by the institution or reimbursement of rent, supplementary sickness insurance and education allowance) for a restricted period of time. The amendments concerning local staff are aimed at improving their social security protection. Currently, local staff working in countries with no, or insufficient, social security systems are asked to contribute to an EU-established scheme, while the Commission pays the employer's contribution. A specific provision should be introduced in the Conditions of Employment, as this scheme provides for minimum social guarantees, which are not ensured by national law. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal is broadly budgetary neutral, although some provisions have a small budgetary impact: application of Article 9a of Annex X to the Staff Regulations would result in savings of around EUR 189 000 per year (decrease in expenditure). This is due to the fact that officials on parental leave receive an allowance, which is lower than their salary. The number of parental leave cases is expected to increase; Article 18 of Annex X provides for the reimbursement of hotel costs when the accommodation provided for in Article 5 of that Annex cannot yet be allocated. It is expected that there would be about 24 cases if this Article 18 were to be applied to contract staff. The annual impact would be EUR 130 000 (increase in expenditure); the amendment to Article 3a of the Conditions of Employment which allows rotation between delegations and Headquarters for contract staff engaged in delegations is not considered to have a budgetary impact; there will be no additional costs incurred by the modification of Article 121 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, as the scheme is already in place and the necessary amounts are included by the budgetary authority in the annual budgets of the European Union."
6635EP7,"""""Disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies and groups""""",0.807,0.857,0.965,0.452,0.273,0.771,0.882,0.143,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to increase the relevance, consistency, and comparability of non-financial information published by undertakings across the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Council Directives 78/660/EE and 83/349/EEC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the approach currently taken in the Accounting Directives on the publication of non-financial information has not produced the desired results. It is estimated that only a limited number of large companies (2500 out of the total of 42000 in the EU) regularly publish non-financial information. The quality of the information disclosed varies, making it difficult for investors and stakeholders to understand and compare companies’ position and performance. Furthermore, national requirements are significantly diverse, which adds to the lack of clarity for companies and investors who operate across the Internal Market. In addition, insufficient diversity in boards may lead to a similarity of views of the members of the board of directors and more resistance to innovative ideas. The need to improve the transparency of the social and environmental information provided by companies in all sectors, in order to ensure a level playing field, has been acknowledged by the Commission in the Single Market Act and was reiterated in the Communication ""A renewed strategy 2011 – 2014 for Corporate Social Responsibility"". The European Parliament, in its two resolutions on “Corporate Social Responsibility: accountable, transparent and responsible business behaviour and sustainable growth” and “Corporate Social Responsibility: promoting society’s interests and a route to sustainable and inclusive recovery”, acknowledged the need to increase transparency in this field and called the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identified two main issues : 1) The inadequate transparency of non-financial information : the analysis has identified both a market and a regulatory failure as underlying causes of the problem. Following the assessment of policy options, the preferred option would be strengthening the existing obligation, by requiring a nonfinancial statement within the Annual Report. 2) The lack of diversity in boards of directors : the most appropriate option, at this stage, would be the disclosure of diversity policy. It is also the option that is preferred by most stakeholders compared to other options such as a compulsory diversity policy or to an action focusing only on recruitment policy. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal sets a requirement for certain large companies to disclose relevant non-financial and diversity information, ensuring a level playing field across the EU. It pursues the following key objectives: to increase the transparency of certain companies, and to increase the relevance, consistency, and comparability of the non-financial information currently disclosed, by strengthening and clarifying the existing requirements ; to increase diversity in the boardrooms of companies through enhanced transparency in order to facilitate an effective oversight of the management and robust governance of the company; to increase the company's accountability and performance, and the efficiency of the Single Market. The main points of the proposed directive are as follows: 1) Non-financial information : the proposal will require certain large companies to include a statement in their Annual Report including material information relating to at least environmental, social, and employee-related matters, respect of human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters. Within these areas, the statement will include (i) a description of its policies, (ii) results and (iii) risk-related aspects. The obligation will only apply to those companies where the average number of employees exceeds 500, and exceeds either a balance sheet total of EUR 20 million or a net turnover of EUR 40 million. This threshold, higher than the one currently applied within the Accounting Directives (250 employees) limits any undue administrative burden. It is estimated that, on this basis, the new requirement would cover around 18.000 companies in the EU. 2) Diversity : the amendment will require large listed companies to provide information on their diversity policy, including aspects concerning age, gender, geographical diversity, and educational and professional background. The information will be included in the corporate governance statement and will have to contain the objectives of such a policy, its implementation and the results obtained. Companies not having a diversity policy will only be obliged to explain why this is the case. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 517/946 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this requirement, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also appropriate to introduce certain slight substantive amendments in Articles 4(2) (Chapter I - General Principles), 6(4) (Chapter II - Union information and investigation procedure) and 23 (Chapter IV- Management of Union import restrictions) of that Regulation. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast. The proposal is part of an alignment exercise following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon to ensure that the previous decision making procedures in trade policy were aligned to the new regime of delegated and implementing acts. Currently, the only countries the EU is importing textiles from that are not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements or by other specific EU import rules – including the Generalised Scheme of Preferences and the Everything but Arms arrangement – are Belarus and North Korea. The proposed Regulation: sets annual quantitative limits for the imports of a number of textile products from these two countries, the management and distribution of which is done through a Commission Implementing Regulation, and it allows for the establishment of Union surveillance and safeguard measures; allows for the imposition of surveillance measures on other third countries where textile imports originating in them cause or threaten to cause serious injury to EU production of like or directly competitive products. Given that the textile sector is a sensitive one for the EU, the proposal aims to ensure that the applicable rules are clear and user-friendly for the operators concerned, and that they ensure legal certainty."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: the European Community, as well as Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, are Contracting Parties to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (""GFCM""), a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation established under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. The GFCM may, on the basis of scientific advice, adopt recommendations and resolutions designed to promote the development, conservation, rational management and best utilization of stocks of living aquatic resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels are considered sustainable and at low risk. Since recommendations adopted by the GFCM are binding on its Contracting Parties and since the Community is such a contracting party, the recommendations are binding on the Community and should therefore be transposed, where their content is not already covered by Community legislation, into Community law. Until recently, recommendations adopted by GFCM have been transposed into Community on a temporary basis, through the annual regulations on fishing opportunities. However, the permanent character of such recommendations would require also a more permanent legal instrument for their transposition into Community law. CONTENT: this draft Regulation transposes recommendations of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), as adopted in its Annual Sessions into Community law. It lays down the rules for the application by the Community of the conservation, management, exploitation, monitoring, marketing and enforcement measures for fishery and aquaculture products as established by the GFCM. It applies to all commercial fishing and aquaculture activities conducted by Community fishing vessels and nationals of Member States in the GFCM Agreement Area. By way of derogation it does not apply to fishing operations conducted solely for the purpose of scientific investigations. Future recommendations can be added by way of amendments to the regulation. This will also improve legal certainty and it is an important step towards simplification. The content and obligations of the recommendations adopted by GFCM are often entirely or partly covered by EU legislation adopted previously and therefore only those aspects which differ from the EU legislation in question need to be transposed, as well as the relevant reporting obligations, where appropriate. Since GFCM recommendations apply to the entire GFCM agreement area which covers the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and connecting waters as referred to in Annex II to Council Decision 1998/416/EC, for reasons of clarity of Community legislation they should be transposed in a regulation separate from Regulation 1967/2006 which only covers the Mediterranean Sea. For reasons of autonomy the GFCM uses the term 'Fisheries Restricted Areas' for spatial management measures. This terminology is equivalent to the 'Fishing Protected Areas' as used in Regulation (EC) N° 1967/2006."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: e xperience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the findings of the group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière, the European Commission has piloted a fundamental overhaul of financial supervision in Europe with the objective of establishing a more efficient, integrated and sustainable European system of supervision. The Group presented its report on 25 February 2009 and its recommendations were endorsed by the Commission in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009. The key elements of the reform proposed by the Commission are : the establishment of a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees in a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board ( ESRB ), which shall monitor and assess potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. In its Communication of 27 May 2009, the Commission proposed that a European Supervisory Authority should be given the responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of certain entities with pan-European reach, e.g., credit rating agencies. These responsibilities would be defined in the Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on Credit Rating Agencies of the European Parliament and of the Council ( Credit rating Agencies Regulation ). The Commission's suggestion was endorsed by the European Council, at its meeting in June 2009, stating clearly that ESMA should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. The European Parliament and the Council requested the Commission to put forward, by 1 July 2010, a report and any legislative proposal needed to tackle the shortcomings identified as regards supervisory coordination and cooperation arrangements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed several options: Option 1: status quo : the key elements of the current supervisory set-up, agreed in the course of the negotiation of the CRA Regulation, would be maintained; Option 2: college structure and ESMA : the ESMA Regulation is adopted as proposed by the Commission on 23 September 2009 and that the supervisory framework as provided by the current CRA Regulation is maintained; Option 3 - ESMA to assume direct oversight of groups of CRAs or all EU-based CRAs : the CRA Regulation would be revised in order to introduce centralised oversight of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Option 3a: ESMA's authority would be limited to the supervision of CRAs (groups of CRAs) with legal presence in more than one Member State. Option 3b: ESMA would be the sole supervisor of all EU-based CRAs. The European Commission therefore considers that it is appropriate to present a proposal amending the Regulation on credit rating agencies. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the TFEU. Community action can address the weaknesses highlighted by the crisis and provide a system that is in line with the objective of a stable and single EU financial market for financial services. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on Credit Rating Agencies which is to be revised in order to introduce centralised oversight of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. ESMA is to assume general competence in matters relating to the registration and on-going supervision of registered credit rating agencies as well as matters related to ratings issued by rating agencies established in third countries that operate in the EU under the certification or endorsement regimes. This proposal does not introduce any changes to the Regulation on credit rating agencies concerning the substantive conditions that CRAs have to fulfil in order to be registered and later on an ongoing basis. Similarly, the conditions under which ratings issued from credit rating agencies located in third countries may be used in the Union (via the endorsement and certification mechanisms, as foreseen in the CRA Regulation) are not subject of the proposed amendments but will remain as provided for in the current CRA Regulation. The main amendments proposed are the following: Subject matter, scope and definitions: in order to align the Regulation with the new proposal for a Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers, alternative investment funds have been listed in order to treat them in the same way as the other EU financial institutions with regard to the use of credit ratings. This implies that in case alternative investment funds use credit ratings for regulatory purposes, those credit ratings must have been issued by a credit rating agency registered or certified under this Regulation. Issuing of Credit Ratings : in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest arising for the CRA under the issuer-pays model which are particularly virulent regarding the rating of structured finance instruments, to enhance transparency and to increase competition among CRAs, issuers of structured finance instruments or related third parties should be required to give access to the information which they have given to the CRA they hired for the purpose of rating structured finance instruments to competing CRAs. Provided they satisfy certain organisational and confidentiality conditions, competing CRAs should be given access, upon request, by the rated entity or a related third party to the information given for the purposes of rating structured finance instruments to the CRAs it hires. The competing CRA being granted access to information should not use it for any other purposes than for the rating and should be required to provide a minimum number of unsolicited ratings, in order to ensure that the request for access to this information does not pursue other purposes. Contrasting to the other substantive requirements in the CRA Regulation which are addressed to credit rating agencies and its staff, this rule imposes disclosure requirements to issuers of structured finance instruments. All registered credit rating agencies will have the possibility to access the information necessary for issuing unsolicited ratings of structured finance instruments. This will lead to more competition in the rating market and increase the number of ratings per instrument so that users of ratings will be able to rely on more than one rating for the same instrument. Registration procedure : as a result of introduction of the new, single supervisory authority for the oversight of credit rating agencies, existing provisions, which envisage a college type of supervisory coordination and ultimate, formal decision-making by a competent authority of the home Member State, are to be eliminated. The creation of ESMA will improve and streamline the procedure for registration, making it simpler (as a result of eliminating redundant consultation steps between authorities in the college and with CESR) and thus it is possible to reduce the time limits in the different stages of the registration process. Surveillance by ESMA: in order to facilitate day-to-day application of the Regulation, ESMA should be empowered to propose draft technical standards to be endorsed by the Commission on: i) the registration process, including on the information set out in Annex II; ii) the information that the credit rating agency must provide for the application for certification and for the assessment of its systemic importance to the financial stability or integrity of financial markets; and iii) the presentation of the information, including structure, format, method and period of reporting, that credit rating agencies shall disclose. ESMA is to be empowered to require all necessary information from CRAs and other persons related to credit rating activity. It will be able to start investigations into the potential breaches of the Regulation and in the remit of those it must be able to exercise supervisory powers such as examining records and other relevant material and taking copies/extracts thereof, requiring oral explanations, hearing a person, requiring records of telephone and data traffic. The ESMA must also be able to conduct on-site inspections. The rights of defence of the persons concerned shall be fully respected in the proceedings. In particular, ESMA must give the persons concerned the opportunity of being heard on the matters to which ESMA has taken objection. Cooperation between ESMA and competent authorities : competent authorities are to keep the oversight responsibilities regarding the use of credit ratings by the supervised entities (like credit institutions, or insurance undertakings) which employ those credit ratings for regulatory purposes. National supervisory authorities must also contribute to the supervisory activity of ESMA, by ensuring all necessary information exchange and co-operation, which may be required in the exercise of supervisory and enforcement powers of ESMA. Where necessary or appropriate for reasons of efficiency, in its supervisory activity ESMA must be able to seek the assistance of a competent supervisory authority at national level. Assistance by competent authorities should be provided when ESMA is carrying out investigations and on site inspections. ESMA may also delegate specific supervisory tasks to competent national authorities. Possible tasks that may be delegated include the carrying out of specific investigatory tasks and on-site inspections, the assessment of an application for registration, but also tasks related to day-to-day supervision. Delegation of tasks will not affect the responsibility of ESMA which may give instructions to the authority to which it has delegated a task. Penalties, Committee procedure and reporting: ESMA may propose to the Commission to impose periodic penalty payments. This coercive measure is to help achieve that: i) an infringement is put to an end, ii) complete and correct information which ESMA has requested is supplied; iii) credit rating agencies and other persons submit to an investigation. ESMA may also propose fines to be adopted by the Commission, where, intentionally or negligently, some of the provisions of the Regulation on credit rating agencies have been breached. Detailed criteria for establishing the amount of the fines as well as procedural aspects related to fines will be set out in a delegated act. In addition to proposing sanctions, ESMA shall also be empowered to adopt supervisory measures where a credit rating agency has committed a breach of the Regulation. Those measures include the temporary prohibition of the issuing of credit ratings and the suspension of the use of the credit ratings concerned until the infringement has been put to an end. As a last resort measure, ESMA is empowered to withdraw the registration of a credit rating agency. In addition, ESMA has the power to require the credit ratings agencies to bring an infringement to an end and to issue public notices. Those measures shall be applied in cases which do not justify the adoption of a sanction or more severe supervisory measure, taking account of the principle of proportionality. The committee procedures have been aligned with the Lisbon Treaty. Transitional and final provisions : once ESMA will be in place and operational, the competent authorities of the Member States will have to terminate their competences and duties related to the supervisory and enforcement activity in the field of credit rating agencies which had been conferred to them by the Regulation on credit rating agencies. BUDGETARY IMPACT: an overall overview of the budgetary implications of the proposals setting up ESMA was presented in September 2009 in the impact assessment report and accompanying legislative financial statements accompanying such legislative proposals (see the legislative financial statement added to the proposal on the setting up of the European Securities Markets Authority). The specific implications on ESMA concerning the direct supervision and oversight of credit rating agencies are specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. The impact for the 2011-2013 are the following: Operating appropriations: EUR1.001 million Human resources and other administrative expenditure: EUR 1.464 million Total appropriations: EUR 2.465 million. The proposal provides for co-funding estimated at EUR 1.501 million in 2011 (60% of total needs by Member States, via EU National Supervisors –proposed ESMA standard financing mechanism)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: energy labelling enables customers to obtain accurate, relevant and comparable information on the energy efficiency and consumption of energy related products wherever they are in the Union allowing them to take informed cost-effective and environmentally friendly purchasing decisions that are both good for the environment and save money. On 25 February 2015, the Commission announced in its Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union a review of Directive 2010/30/EU on the Energy Labelling Directive in order to further exploit the potential of energy efficiency for the moderation of energy demand and consequent reduction of the energy dependency of the European Union. Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council was evaluated for its effectiveness. The evaluation identified the need to update the Energy Labelling framework to improve its effectiveness. For 2030 the European Council set in October 2014 an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency which will be reviewed by 2020, having in mind an EU level of 30%. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment looks at both a number of issues with the current Directive and some specific items concerning the Ecodesign Directive. The two most important issues concerning the Energy Labelling Directive were: reduced effectiveness of the energy label and non-compliance due to weak enforcement; long rulemaking processes, leading to outdated technical and preparatory work. The final option chosen was to: (i) improve the existing regulatory framework on energy labelling, (ii) require labelled products to be registered in a new database,(iii) improve the legal structure by changing the current Energy Labelling Directive to a Regulation, to align it with the market surveillance regulation, and to, (iv) fund EU joint market surveillance actions. CONTENT: this proposal follows up on the Energy Union Framework Strategy and intends to replace Directive 2010/30/EU on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products by a Regulation. In the proposal, the objectives and main principles of the current Energy Labelling Directive are retained but the proposal clarifies, strengthens and extends the scope of the current Directive's provisions by: (1) Updating the label and allowing for rescaling : the success of energy labelling means that the label is running into its limits. Although A+ to A+++ energy efficiency classes were added in 2010, for some product groups, all models are already in those new classes and there are no longer any models in the lower classes. There is a systematic need to 'rescale' products and to go back to the original A to G energy label scale, which studies suggest is the one best understood by consumers. Although the current Directive allows for the possible reclassification of products through specific delegated acts, the current proposal deals with the need to rescale the energy labels in a much more systematic manner. It also makes clear the obligations on suppliers and dealers during the rescaling and replacement phase. The existing labels will be reviewed by the Commission within five years of the entry into force of the Regulation, with a view to rescaling them. The delegated act would contain a specific date by which the 'old' labels would have to be replaced with the rescaled label (the ""replacement date""). During a transitional period, dealers would be required to replace the old label with the new one on all products on display in shops . They would have one week to replace all labels with the new ones. Member States would be required to run promotional information campaigns to inform consumers of the rescaling exercise. (2) Creating a database of products covered by energy labelling obligations : overall non-compliance in the market is estimated at 20%, leading to some 10% of envisaged energy savings being lost. The new product registration database: (i) will allow market surveillance authorities much quicker access to the necessary information; (ii) will provide up-to-date market data and energy efficiency information which will accelerate the preparatory/review studies and subsequent regulatory process. The proposal also updates the Directive's requirements in terms of providing for electronic supply of labels or for suppliers to make them available on their websites. The administrative burden for registering products is estimated at EUR 1.5 million per year for the entire industry; about 0.5 eurocent per product sold. (3) Making clearer the obligations of the various parties: the proposal regroups the respective obligations on Member States, suppliers and dealers in order to make these more coherent and simpler. The replacement of the Directive with a Regulation means less administrative burden for Member States and directly applicable requirements for suppliers and dealers which will ensure a complete harmonisation across the EU. (4) Improving the link between energy labelling and measurement standards : the proposal makes clear that a product which complies with the measurement and calculation methods set out in the relevant harmonised standard will be presumed to comply with the relevant provisions of the applicable delegated act. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this initiative does not require additional EU budgetary resources. The costs concern: setting up a products database (1.500.000 EUR in 2016 and 150.000 EUR yearly maintenance cost in subsequent years); consumer understanding studies for labels for specific product groups (300.000 EUR per year from 2017). These are financed through reprioritisation of existing budget for the implementation of the policy on energy efficiency of products. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
3300EP7,"""""Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the EC and Israel on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (CAA)""""",0.684,0.835,0.035,0.71,0.303,0.506,0.169,0.086,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to conclude an additional Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the EU-Israel on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA). PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: this Agreement is presented as a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, signed on 20 November 1995 rather than as a stand alone Agreement. The Protocol will allow Community exporters, if they so choose, to test and certify their industrial products to the same (aligned) requirements prior to export, and then access that market without any further conformity assessment requirements. The certification procedures will only need to be carried out one time for both markets and against the same aligned requirements or standards. The recognition of certification will permit savings and stimulate exports. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 in conjunction the first sentence of the first subparagraph of Article 300(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopts this proposal for a decision to conclude the ACAA with Israel. General principles of the Agreement : the ACAA facilitates market access by eliminating technical barriers to trade with respect to industrial products. To this end, the ACAA provides for two mechanisms: under the first mechanism, mutual recognition of products operates on the basis of the acquis communautaire that has been transposed by the partner country, in the same way as it would apply to products placed on the market of a Member State. It allows industrial products covered by it and attested as compliant according to the procedures of the European Union to be placed on the Israeli market without having to undergo any further approval procedures, and vice versa. At present one sector is included: good manufacturing practice (GMP) for pharmaceutical products. Israel has taken over the Community technical legislation in the sector covered by the Annex to the Protocol and participates in the European organisations in the sector covered by it; the second mechanism, i.e., the mutual acceptance of industrial products not commonly regulated, confirms that Articles 16 and 17 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement with Israel apply without other restriction in the product sectors covered by it. That is, Annexes applying this mechanism will provide that where no European technical regulations exist, industrial products listed under such Annexes lawfully traded in the market of either Party (i.e., on the territory of Israel or that of one of the Member States of the EU) may be lawfully traded in the other. No annexes making this mechanism operational are at present included. Main provisions of the Framework Agreement : Purpose and means : the ACAA aims to eliminate technical barriers to trade in respect to industrial products. The ACAA provides for two mechanisms, as described above. Alignment of legislation : Israel has a commitment to take appropriate measures to take over and maintain measures to align with and maintain Community law, as it applies to products covered by the Agreement. For New Approach sectors (which will be explicitly identified as such in the Annexes that relate to them) there is also an obligation on Israel to maintain relevant transposed standards, in the same way as a Member State of the EU. Infrastructure : Israel is committed to establish and maintain a quality infrastructure equivalent to that of the EU for sectors covered by the Protocol. Mutual acceptance of industrial products : the principles of the two mechanisms underlying the mutual acceptance of products onto the market of the other Party, as described above, are detailed in this Agreement. There is also a provision that, unless otherwise agreed, the ACAA does not entail any obligation, for one Party, to accept product attested as compliant by bodies other than those of the Parties. Safeguard clause : each Party has the right to deny market access when that Party is able to demonstrate that a product might endanger legitimate concerns covered by legislation applicable to the products covered by an Annex (mainly to do with safety or public health). The Annexes will provide for the detailed procedures to be used in such cases. Extension of coverage : Parties may modify the scope and coverage of this Protocol through amendment of the Annexes or by the addition of new ones. Obligations of Parties as regards their responsible authorities and notified bodies : Parties are obliged to ensure that their responsible authorities monitor the technical competence and compliance of their respective notified bodies and have power and expertise for designating, suspending, and withdrawing such bodies. In addition, they are obliged to ensure that their notified bodies comply with the requirements of Community and aligned national law, and maintain their technical competence to carry out the tasks for which they have been notified. Notified bodies : a procedure for the notification of bodies to assess conformity in relation to the legal requirements specified in the corresponding annexes is provided. The procedure is similar to the one applied within the Community. It also sets out the procedure for the withdrawal of notified bodies. Verification of notified bodies : each Party has the right to request a verification of a body notified by the other Party. The verification may be done either by the authorities which have designated the body or together by the authorities of both Parties. The notified body would be suspended until a final decision is taken. Exchange of information : measures are provided as regards the transparency provision. This provision ensures uniform application and interpretation of the Protocol. It also provides for the Parties to encourage their notified bodies to co-operate to establish mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sphere. Confidentiality : this standard provision prohibits disclosing information acquired under this Protocol. Management of the Agreement : responsibility for the effective functioning of this Agreement shall be borne by the Committee (subcommittee ""Industry, trade and services"" - set up and designated for trade purposes under Article 73 of the Association Agreement). Its main tasks shall be to add and amend Annexes, appoint experts for verifications, consider new arrangements, and resolve questions related to the Protocol. Technical co-operation and assistance : measures are provided as regards technical co-operation and assistance with a view to properly implementing this Protocol. Agreements with other countries : the agreement can be extended to other countries by explicit agreement, and encourages - but does not force - Israel to make agreements similar to the Protocol, and covering the same products, that the EU might make with another country. Annexes annex on Mutual Acceptance of Industrial Products: there is one Annex, covering good manufacturing practice (GMP) for pharmaceutical products. It operates by the mechanism described above whereby mutual recognition of products operates on the basis of the acquis communautaire that has been transposed by Israel. Advanced therapy products, special medicinal products based on tissues and cells of human origin, and medicinal products that include blood products shall not be concerned. The inclusion of these fields may be agreed between the Parties if the Israeli legislation governing them is brought into alignment; annexes on Mutual Acceptance of Industrial Products no commonly regulated: no such annexes have been negotiated for the moment. The ACAA provides nevertheless the basis for such acceptance of products. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the European Union budget."
2012EP7,"""""Supplementary supervision of financial entities in a financial conglomerate""""",0.825,0.883,0.912,0.645,0.485,0.964,0.856,0.543,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure supplementary supervision of large financial conglomerates. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: about 20 years ago, financial groups with business models that combine the provision of services and products in different sectors of financial markets began to develop. These became known as financial conglomerates. Conglomerates may include banks, insurance undertakings, investment firms and possibly asset management companies. Directive 2002/87/EC ('FICOD') introduced group-wide supplementary supervision. The objective of this supplementary supervision was to control potential risks arising from double gearing (i.e. multiple use of capital) and group risks, that is, the risks of contagion, management complexity, concentration, and conflicts of interest, which could arise when several licenses for different financial services are combined. Whilst the banking and insurance directives aim at calculating sufficient capital buffers for the protection of customers and policyholders, FICOD, regulates the supplementary supervision of group risks. This implies that financial entities which have a mutual relationship that affects the risk profiles of both of them must be included in the supervisory scope. In this way, FICOD supplements the sectoral directives, the Banking Directive 2006/48/EC ('CRD') and various insurance directives, all of which can be applied on a solo level, per licensed entity, and on a consolidated level, where all licensed legal entities subject to the same directive are aggregated. A review of FICOD was envisaged some years after its implementation. The review of the FICOD effectively started in 2008 and formed the basis of this legislative proposal. Certain technical issues were included in the Commission's proposal for an Omnibus Directive in October 2009, accompanying the Regulations establishing the new European Supervisory Authorities. During the financial crisis, so-called group risks have materialized all across the financial sector, emphasising the importance of supplementary supervision of inter-linkages within financial groups and among financial institutions. Initiatives similar to the current review were undertaken in the U.S. and Australia, based on the Joint Forum's principles. The Commission intends to proceed in two steps: with the present proposal, the most urgent technical issues identified during the review, as analysed by the Joint Committee on Financial Conglomerates  ('JCFC'), are addressed, including the technical issues detected in earlier review exercises. Calls for advice and a consultation were issued to assess the impact of these potential changes; later in 2010, a more fundamental debate will take place in the context of G20 developments regarding supplementary supervision. This debate is likely to focus on supervisory scope and capital related issues. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: 17 policy options have been developed, assessed and compared with a view to addressing the issues identified in the analysis. Please see the summary of the Commission Staff Working Document (SEC(2010)0981) for further details. Expected impacts of the preferred policy measures concern the following: supplementary supervision on holding company level and supervisory coordination; identification of financial conglomerates; participations. The positively assessed policy changes were expected to render the supplementary supervision framework more robust, leading to more effective risk management incentives and practices. This should be beneficial to the international competitiveness position of EU financial groups. These options should contribute positively to containing the risks to financial stability and the possible costs to society. LEGAL BASE: Article 53(1) TFEU, which is the appropriate legal basis for the harmonisation of rules relating to financialinstitutions and financial conglomerates. CONTENT: the aim of this legislative proposal is to amend the IGD, the FICOD and the CRD in order to eliminate unintended consequences and technical omissions in the sectoral directives and ensure that the objectives of the FICOD are effectively achieved. The main points are as follows: Top level supervision : in order to align supervisory powers at the top level of a conglomerate, to prevent the loss of powers when a group structure changes as well as the duplication of supervision at the conglomerate level, and to facilitate coordination by the most relevant supervisors, the following amendments were positively assessed: include top level holding companies of a banking or an insurance group that are classified as a MFHC, so that provisions and powers that are applied to the former Financial Holding Company (FHC) or Insurance Holding Company (IHC) do not disappear when the classification of a group and its holding company changes as a result of an acquisition in the other sector. In order to ensure that all necessary supervisory tools can be applied, this proposal introduces the term 'mixed financial holding company' into the relevant provisions on consolidated/group supervision in the sectoral directives. Identification of a conglomerate : provisions governing the identification of financial conglomerates give rise to three sub-problems: (i) the directive does not require the inclusion of 'asset management companies' in the threshold tests; (ii) the threshold tests can be based on different parameters with respect to assets and capital requirements. The provisions are ambiguous as regards the calculation of the tests; (iii) the threshold conditions, given their fixed amounts, are not risk-based, and the notion of expected group risks is not addressed by the threshold test. In order to tackle these deficiencies, this proposal introduces the following changes: the draft directive proposes the inclusion of asset management companies at all times. Furthermore 'total assets under management' is introduced as an alternative indicator and there is included the option of proving guidelines on the application of the relevant provisions; a waiver for smaller groups is introduced, allowing for guidelines for the application of the waiver to smaller groups; the text is re-worded properly to distinguish the applicable conditions for groups below and above the EUR 6 billion threshold and adds requirements as to possible guidelines for the application of the waiver to larger groups and thus ensures a level playing field. Treatment of participations : the consistent treatment of participations in day-to-day supplementary supervision is hampered by the lack of relevant information to properly assess group risks. For example, if information about risks with respect to participations in insurance and reinsurance companies cannot be obtained by bank-led conglomerates, they cannot provide their supervisors with the evidence of a satisfactory level of integration of management and internal control with these entities that is necessary for consolidation. In that case, the group needs to deduct such participations from their capital. While the issue of information on minority participations is not yet fully examined, a first step contained in this proposal is the introduction of a waiver where participation is the only trigger for identification. As long as national company law provisions may hamper the fulfilment of requirements, specific treatment in view of risk concentration and intra group transaction requirements is allowed and may be specified via guidelines. Guidelines may also support the consistent application of supervisory review processes, including specific treatment of participations, as provided for in FICOD, CRD and Solvency II. Other issues : the proposal deals with the following matters: it updates certain definitions in the directives; it amends the definition of relevant competent authority and supervisory coordination: certain provisions in FICOD leave room for different interpretations as regards the identification of the relevant competent authorities. An extensive interpretation results in a high number of authorities that must be consulted by the coordinator at the financial conglomerate level. This may undermine the efficient coordination of the work to be carried out by the ""college"" of a coordinator and relevant competent authorities; deletion of the third calculation method: FICOD lists three methods for calculating capital at the conglomerate level. An analysis showed that the third eligible capital calculation method always results in outcomes that are significantly different from methods 1 (consolidation) and 2 (deduction and aggregation). Therefore, the third method should be deleted. By restricting the eligible calculation methods to the consolidation and the deduction and aggregation method, FICOD is also aligned to the sectoral directives it supplements; inclusion of reinsurance undertakings: with the introduction of authorisation and supervision of reinsurance undertakings in Directive 2005/68/EC, reinsurance undertakings were included in the scope of regulated entities that can be part of a financial conglomerate. Consequently, a reference to reinsurance undertakings has to be included in FICOD; introduction of provisions regarding guidelines in certain areas: in order to allow for further convergence of supervisory practices, a possibility for the European Banking Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority to issue guidelines is introduced. These guidelines should reflect the supplementary nature of this Directive. By way of example, when assessing risk concentrations on a group wide basis relating to several risk types potentially materializing throughout the group (interest rate risk, market risk, etc.), this assessment should complement the specific supervision of for example large exposures as provided for in the CRD. Guidelines may also support the consistent application of the different supervisory review processes, including specific treatment of participations, as provided for in FICOD, CRD and Solvency II. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the budget of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: road safety is an issue of major concern across the entire European Union and for all of its citizens. Currently, road journeys exceed 100 million annually across the various Member States and they are increasing due to further consolidation of the European Union. The purpose of the interoperable EU-wide eCall initiative is ultimately to introduce in all vehicles in the EU the minimum functionalities needed to ensure adequate handling of the emergency calls by the emergency response services. Action is needed at EU level in order to guarantee interoperability and continuity of the service throughout Europe. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed three options : Option 1 : no EU action; Option 2 : voluntary approach; Option 3 : regulatory measures. Option 3 is the chosen option. The benefits identified through the impact assessment include: · reduction of fatalities (with all vehicles eCall-equipped, between 1% and 10% depending on country population density, road and emergency response infrastructure); · reduction of seriousness of the injuries (between 2% and 15%); · reduction of congestion costs caused by traffic accidents; · facilitation of rescue services and increased security of rescue team (e.g. firefighters) when extracting trapped occupants, as the Minimum Set of Data (“MSD”) in the eCall message will, among others, provide information on the fuel type; · reduced SOS roadside infrastructure, as each road user would be able to trigger an emergency call from their vehicle. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation forms part of a set of EU legal acts for ensuring the deployment of the 112-based eCall service by 1 October 2015. The other main legislative acts linked to this eCall initiative are: Commission Recommendation 2011/750/EU of 8 September 2011 as well as the Proposal for Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deployment of the interoperable EU-wide eCall. The proposal: requires new types of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to be constructed as to ensure that in the event of a severe accident an emergency call (eCall) to the 112 is triggered automatically. It must also be possible to trigger manually emergency calls (eCalls) to the 112; provides for rules concerning privacy and data protection. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no budgetary implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 applying the current GSP scheme provides that the preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation may be withdrawn temporarily, in respect of all or of certain products originating in a beneficiary country, for the serious and systematic violation of principles laid down in fifteen out of the twenty-seven international conventions listed in its Annex, on the basis of the conclusions of the relevant monitoring bodies. The relevant conventions also cover core labour rights such as forced labour. Myanmar/Burma's access to the GSP tariff preferences was temporarily withdrawn by Council Regulation (EC) No 552/97 due to routine and widespread practice of forced labour, confirmed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in a special procedure of its Commission of Inquiry. Since 2011, Myanmar/Burma has been undertaking a historic programme of openness and reform and the Council is now in favour of ""reinstating the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for Myanmar/Burma as soon as possible once the required conditions are fulfilled, following the assessment of the International Labour Organisation"". On 13 June 2012, the International Labour Conference (ILC) lifted restrictions, which excluded the Government of Myanmar/Burma from receiving ILO technical cooperation and assistance. Accordingly, the violations cannot be any longer considered as ""serious and systematic"" and thus the tariff preferences should be reinstated according to the current GSP Regulation. For these reasons, it is recommended that Myanmar/Burma’s access to generalized tariff preferences should be reinstated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, it is envisaged to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 552/97 for the reasons described above. It should be noted that in the absence of explicit reinstatement provisions in the current GSP Regulation, and in light of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, the ordinary legislative procedure is applied for the adoption of the reinstatement of preferences for Myanmar. This is a one-off procedure aimed at responding to a clear and present political need as expeditiously as possible. The new GSP Regulation which will apply only as of 1 January 2014 redresses the absence of reinstatement provisions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation does not incur costs to the EU budget and its application entails a very limited loss of customs revenue. The actual loss of customs revenue resulting from reintegration of Myanmar/Burma is estimated at less than €5 million and is due to a structural lack of production and trading capacity in the country."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while investment conditions in Europe have improved since the launch of the Juncker plan in 2014, thanks to a more favourable economic situation and government interventions such as the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI), there is still a significant investment gap in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major shock to the world and EU economies. The contraction of EU GDP in 2020 - forecast at around 7.5% - is expected to be much deeper than during the 2009 financial crisis. For the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission therefore considers it necessary to propose a reinforced EU investment programme to provide crucial support to businesses and to ensure a strong focus of private investors on the Union's medium and long-term priorities, including the Green Deal for Europe and digital transitions, as well as increased resilience. This is why the Commission is withdrawing its May 2018 proposal for the InvestEU programme and submitting a new proposal that takes full account of the partial agreement reached in April 2019 between the Parliament and the Council. This new proposal (i) increases the amount of the initially proposed financial envelope (ii) amends the scope of the proposal to reflect on the post-pandemic needs of the European economy. It builds on the lessons learned from the EFSI evaluations and previous financial instruments (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020, COSME, Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme etc.). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to create the InvestEU programme for the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027 in order to bring together under a single structure all financing from the EU budget in the form of loans and guarantees. The InvestEU programme shall be based on the following elements: The InvestEU Fund The InvestEU Fund shall mobilise public and private investment through a EU budget guarantee of EUR 75 153 850 000 (in current prices) which aims to support the investment projects of implementing partners. The Commission proposes that the guarantee be provisioned at 45%, which means that EUR 33 800 000 000 from the EU budget shall be set aside in case calls are made on the guarantee. The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group shall remain a privileged implementing partner for the Invest EU. It shall implement 75% of the EU guarantee. National development banks or institutions may also become implementing partners. Five policy windows The InvestEU Fund shall operate through 5 policy windows, each of which is aimed at addressing market failures or investment shortfalls within their specific scope: 1. sustainable infrastructure; 2. research, innovation and digitisation; 3. SMEs; 4. social investment and skills; 5. strategic European investments. In addition to increasing the resources of the sustainable infrastructure window, the Commission proposes to broaden the scope of the programme by adding a fifth strand - strategic European investment - with a view to meeting the future needs of the European economy and promoting and ensuring the strategic autonomy of the Union in key sectors. This window shall be endowed with an amount of up to EUR 31 153 850 000. This new window shall support final recipients established in a Member State and carrying out an activity of strategic importance to the Union, in particular with a view to green and digital transitions and increased resilience in areas such as: - provision of critical health care, manufacturing and stockpiling of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and medical supplies, strengthening the capacity to respond to health crises; - critical infrastructure (e.g. energy, transport, environment, health, 5G, Internet of Things); - key enabling, transformative, green and digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, block chains, renewable energy technologies, biomedicine). The InvestEU Advisory Hub The advisory hub would provide technical support and assistance in the preparation, development, structuring and implementation of projects, including capacity-building. The EIB Group would play a central role in the implementation of advisory support under the Hub. A financial envelope of EUR 724 733 000 (in current prices) is foreseen for the InvestEU Advisory Hub. The InvestEU Portal The InvestEU Portal shall be established to provide for an easily accessible and user-friendly project database to promote visibility of investment projects searching for financing with enhanced focus on the provision of a possible pipeline of investment projects, compatible with Union law and policies. Governance An investment committee of independent experts shall remain responsible for approving individual requests. The Commission performs a policy check on proposed financing or investment operations to verify that they are compliant with EU law before a proposal is submitted to the Investment Committee. Budgetary implications For the period 2021-2027, the budgetary framework (commitments at current prices) foreseen for the InvestEU programme amounts to EUR 33 524 733 000. The overall provisioning will amount to EUR 33 800 million, of which EUR 1 billion will be covered by revenues, repayments and recoveries generated by existing financial instruments and the EFSI."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the European Refugee Fund (ERF) was set up by Decision No 573/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 as part of the General programme ""Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows"". This proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, amending the Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 (ERF III), and the Communication of the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the establishment of a Joint EU Resettlement Programme are part of the European Union's efforts to establish a Joint EU Resettlement Programme. They are a response to the requests by the Council to come forward with a proposal for the establishment of a Joint EU Resettlement Programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examines 3 different options and 2 sub-options as well as their respective effects. These can be summarised as follows: Option 1: maintenance of status quo : Option 2: medium option : u nder this option it is envisaged to develop further structured political cooperation through the establishment of a political framework and to underpin it via the financial component. It is foreseen that a political framework will be created which would set political and strategic priorities with respect to resettlement. Under this option practical cooperation will also be developed by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The following measures are also provided: (i) setting of common EU annual priorities with respect to resettlement, both with respect to nationalities and specific categories of refugees to be resettled; (ii) Member States would receive extra financial assistance under the ERF III, if they resettle according to these common EU annual priorities; (iii) ensuring an integrated approach between resettlement, external asylum policies and EU external policies as a whole. Within the 2nd option, two sub-options are identified . The difference between these sub-options relate only to the mechanism which is foreseen for the political framework. Sub-option 2A provides for the establishment of a new Committee on resettlement under Comitology rules. Sub-option 2B provides for the use of existing structures. Option 3: maximum option : u nder this option it is considered that a fully developed EU wide resettlement scheme will be established. Resettlement would be carried out jointly in terms of priority setting and also in terms of implementation. However, this option is considered to be very ambitious and has been abandoned due to its lack of feasibility at the current stage of the Union’s policy on this issue. Conclusion : sub-option 2B is preferred option on grounds of political feasibility and proportionality. There is a strong preference among a majority of Member States to build on existing consultation and decision making mechanisms. The current political situation is positive towards resettlement but reluctant to create any new formal structure, because of the bureaucratic burden this might entail and the fear that Member States' freedom to decide on priorities themselves would be reduced. From the perspective of proportionality the use of existing structures is considered preferable, if this is as effective in reaching the objectives and if it is expected to have the same impacts. CONTENT: the proposed measures seek to amend the Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 in order to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of those categories of persons which are annually identified as common EU resettlement priorities for the following year. Annual resettlement priorities : the identification of these priorities will be done on the basis of an indicative forecast of resettlement needs which will be provided by UNHCR in spring (mid-March) each year and in close consultation with the resettlement experts of Member States, UNHCR and other stakeholders. For this purpose an annual meeting will be organized in which these experts participate. On the basis of the outcomes of the meeting, the Commission will draft a proposal for a Decision identifying the common EU resettlement priorities, and will submit it for consultation to the management committee of the General Programme ""Solidarity and management of migratory flows' including the ERF III. Within 20 calendar days following the adoption of the Commission Decision on common EU resettlement priorities, Member States will provide the Commission with an estimate of the number of persons whom they will resettle in the course of the following calendar year according to these common EU annual priorities. These annual priorities may relate to geographic regions, nationalities or specific categories of refugees to be resettled. Additional financial assistance for a resettled refugee : on the basis of these pledges, Member State will receive, as an additional financial assistance, a fixed amount of EUR 4000 for each effectively resettled refugee during a respective calendar year who will fall under one of the specific categories which will be defined annually as common EU annual priorities by the Decision of the Commission. Member States will receive this fixed amount per refugee only once in case such refugee would fall under more than one of the specific categories. Timetable : the proposal provides for the setting up of a timetable as regards: the deadline for the submission of the pledging, necessary for the calculation of annual allocations between Member States; the deadline for the submission of annual programmes by Member States to the Commission; the deadline for the adoption of financing decisions by the Commission. In comparison to the deadlines set up in the current legal base, new deadlines are postponed due to the new procedure for the adoption of the common EU annual priorities for resettlement which will precede the calculation of annual allocations between Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal complies with the appropriations and programming of the General programme ""Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows"" until 2013. Furthermore, it does not alter the general objectives of the ERF and its financial programming until 2013. Only a very limited additional costs are foreseen with respect to administrative expenses (a total of EUR 158 000 for the period 2010-2013)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the US have a close trade and investment relationship. Bilateral trade in goods and services between them amounts to more than EUR 1000 billion per year, or EUR 3 billion per day. On 21 August 2020 Commissioner Hogan and US Trade Representative Lighthizer stated their intention to go ahead with a trade-facilitating package to eliminate or reduce customs duties for a small number of tariff lines covering EUR 168 million (approximatively USD 200 million) in EU and US exports. The Commission therefore proposes to create additional opportunities for EU and US operators by eliminating or reducing tariffs. It sees this initiative as a first step to de-escalate bilateral trade tensions and to support the settlement of on-going disputes. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to eliminate a number of customs tariffs on lobster. Lobster is not sensitive products for the EU, which is a net importer of these products. EU producers supply less than 5% of European consumption. The elimination of import duties shall support the food-processing industry and the hospitality sector. In return, the US has committed to ease market access for EU27 exports worth EUR 143 million (USD 160 million) on average in the past three years, through a 50% reduction of duties. These include products such as prepared meals, certain crystal glassware, surface preparations, propellant powders, cigarette lighters and lighter parts. The US requested the tariff reduction for lobster in light of its declining exports of the product to Europe and the world. The tariff reductions should be implemented in a fully WTO consistent manner and respect the most-favoured nation (MFN) principle. The measures shall apply retroactively as of 1 August 2020 and end on 31 July 2025. The agreement shall have a limited negative impact on the budget of the EU in the form of foregone customs duties due to tariff liberalisation for the products covered by the tariff lines in annex to this Regulation, representing some EUR 5.3 million in duties collected from the US (average 2017-2019 period)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: as announced in the Policy Plan on Asylum, this proposal is part of a first package of proposals which aim to ensure a higher degree of harmonisation and better standards of protection for the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). It is adopted at the same time as the recast of the Dublin Regulation and the Reception Conditions Directive. EURODAC, a Community-wide information technology system, was created to facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention. The Convention was replaced by a Community law instrument Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (""the Dublin Regulation""). EURODAC allows Member States to determine whether an asylum applicant or a foreign national illegally present in a Member State has previously applied for asylum in another Member State . Among other criteria, the Dublin Regulation allocates responsibility for the assessment of an asylum claim on the basis of which Member State allowed the applicant to the territory of the Member States. EURODAC allows Member States to verify whether the asylum-seeker was previously apprehended when crossing irregularly the border of a Member State coming from a third country. The EURODAC Regulation lays down strictly defined and harmonised rules regarding the storage, comparison and erasure of fingerprints, while it also provides for data protection and data security safeguards. It provides for the implementation of a Central Unit (CU) managed by the European Commission containing an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). Fingerprints taken by Member States are sent to this system which indicates whether the same fingerprints are already stored in the database and if this is the case, which Member State sent them in. In addition to fingerprints, the central database also keeps record of the place and date of the application for asylum, the Member State which entered the data and its reference number, the gender of the applicant, the date on which the fingerprints were taken and when they were transmitted to the CU. These data are collected for any asylum applicant and any third country national or stateless person apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border at least 14 years of age. The data can be kept for up to 10 years and up to 2 years respectively, unless the individual obtains the citizenship of one of the Member States, receives a residence permit or leaves the territory of the Member States (at which point the data is erased). In its evaluation report, the Commission acknowledged that the Regulation is applied in a generally satisfactory way, but identified certain issues related to the efficiency of the current legislative provisions which have to be tackled in order to improve EURODAC's support of the Dublin Regulation. These include the continuing late transmission of fingerprints by a number of Member States; inefficient management of data deletions; unclear specification of national authorities having access to EURODAC, which hinders the monitoring role of the Commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS); and the fact that that some persons already granted asylum in a Member State nevertheless apply again in another. Regarding the more efficient use of the EURODAC database, the proposal aims to: establish rules to ensure truly prompt transmission of fingerprints to the Central Unit of EURODAC in order to ensure that the Member State responsible under the Dublin Regulation for examining the application is correctly identified; update and clarify definitions of the different stages of management of the database, also in line with the objective to house all large-scale IT systems under Title IV of the TEC in one location under one management and running on the same platform (enabling to improve productivity and reduce operational costs); to unblock data on recognised refugees and to make them searchable by national asylum authorities, in order to avoid a situation where recognised refugee in one Member State applies for protection in another Member State . Regarding data protection concerns, the proposal aims to: establish technical rules to ensure that Member States delete data which is no longer necessary for the purpose for which were collected and to ensure that Commission can better monitor the respect of the data protection principles; clarify the provisions ensuring effective monitoring by the Commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) of access to data in EURODAC by national authorities. Since it has not been used, the Commission proposes to abolish the committee provided for by the Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. CONTENT: in June 2003, the European Community and its Member States were given a mandate to negotiate an Agreement with the United States of America for an “Air Transport Agreement”. The mandate was given following rulings by the European Court of Justice in November 2002 which stated that existing bi-lateral arrangements in the air transport sector were incompatible with EU law. Currently, there are twenty separate Agreements in place governing the laws and provisions of air operations between Europe and the US. The objective of the negotiations, therefore, was the establishment of an “Open Aviation Area” (OOA) between the EU and US. The idea being to create a single market for air transport between the EU and US in which EU and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction and which would include the domestic markets of both parties. Given the wide-ranging implications of such an Agreement, most notably the requirement for the US to remove restrictions on foreign legal ownership and control of US airlines cabotage, the Agreement became a politically sensitive issue for the US government. To address this problem both parties have agreed to a staggered implementation of the Agreement. At the same time, however, there is an implicit understanding that mechanisms should be put in place which allow the Agreement to become more complete. As a first stage, the EU has accepted that cabotage will not be included in the first Agreement. The EU has made clear to the US that this would only be acceptable if meaningful progress can be made towards the removal of restrictions on ownership and control of US airlines. As such the Council has stated that it will take particular notice of progress made by the US Department of Transportations and its pledge to re-interpret the statutory requirement that US airlines can only be under the “actual control” of US citizens. In other words, the adoption of this Decision by the Council will be subject to US adoption of rules deemed to constitute clear, meaningful and robust changes to the US’ policy vis-à-vis foreign ownership of its commercial air fleet. Depending on the speed with which the US confirms its commitment to re-assessing its current statutes, signature of the Agreement could take place in the first half of 2006. The Agreement represents a comprehensive first-stage agreement that will replace the existing bilateral agreements concluded by the Member States with the United States. It removes all existing restrictions on the rights of both Community air carriers and Unites States air carriers to operate between points in the European Community and points in the United States. Further, the Agreement established provisions which allow Community air carriers uniform conditions for market access; it establishes new arrangements for regulatory co-operation between the European Community and the United States and it establishes provisions essential to the safe, secure and efficient operation of transatlantic air services. There will be strengthened co-operation in matters concerning aviation security and aviation safety and there will be new arrangement for co-operation between the EU-US Competition authorities concerning the application of their respective competition regimes affecting the transatlantic market. All of the terms will simultaneously apply to the 25 EU Member States who will apply the same rules without discrimination and in a uniform manner. In return, Community air carriers will be able to access commercial opportunities, which Member States, acting individually, have been unable to secure. In short, adoption of the proposed Agreement will help enact one of the main objectives of the negotiations, namely the creation of a level playing field between all the EU and US air carriers, complemented by tight regulatory rules. The proposal has no implications for the Community budget."
1422EP7,"""""Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection""""",0.789,0.681,0.035,0.323,0.242,0.964,0.708,0.057,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: the authorisation of enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: on 1 August 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the Community patent. It proposed the creation of a unitary Community patent which would co-exist with national patents granted by national patent offices of the Member States and European patents granted under the European Patent Convention (EPC) by the European Patent Office (EPO). The proposal was extensively discussed in the meetings of the Council, but failed to reach the required unanimity in particular because of the language arrangements. On 3 March 2003, the Council adopted a common political approach on the Community patent. This provided that patent proprietors would have to supply translations of the claims into all the official languages of the Member States. This arrangement was rejected by all users of the patent system as too costly and too risky. The Council concluded that due to the issue of the translation regime it was unable to reach a political agreement on the proposed Regulation on the Community Patent. Discussions in the Council were re-launched after adoption of the Commission Communication ""Enhancing the patent system in Europe"" in April 2007. In December 2009, the Council adopted conclusions on an ""Enhanced patent system for Europe"" and a general approach on the proposal for a Regulation on the EU Patent. However, the translation arrangements for the EU patent remained out of the scope of these Council conclusions due to the change of the legal basis for the creation of the EU patent under the Lisbon Treaty. On this basis, on 30 June 2010, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the EU patent without obtaining the required unanimity of the Council of Ministers of the EU. On 10 December 2010, the Council that insurmountable difficulties existed, making a decision requiring unanimity impossible now and in the foreseeable future. It follows that the objectives of the proposed Regulations to establish unitary patent protection in the entire European Union can not be attained within a reasonable period by applying the relevant provisions of the Treaties. Twelve Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have addressed formal requests to the Commission indicating that they wish to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection and that the Commission should submit a proposal to the Council to that end. This proposal is the Commission's response to those requests. ASSESSMENT OF THE LEGAL CONDITIONS FOR ENHANCED COOPERATION: the current national patent systems of Member States and the European patent system only provide territorially-limited protection. This resulted in ‘gaps’ that gave rise to the following undesirable effects: i) lost business opportunities; ii) innovative firms are at a disadvantage; iii) the value of patents is weakened, given that patent holders cannot count on Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 (the EU Customs Border Regulation) to prevent infringing goods and products from third countries from entering the internal market through Member States in which there is no patent protection. The creation of a unitary patent title for a group of Member States would entail immediate tangible advantages for users of the patent system in Europe: improved access to patent protection : the unitary patent for the area covered by enhanced cooperation would ensure easier access to patent protection for all users of the patent system in Europe both for applicants from participating Member States and from non-participating Member States. The area for enhanced cooperation would cover a market that is much larger than any market of a single Member State, resulting in reduced costs of protection relative to the size of the economy. cost reduction and simplification : unitary patent protection created under enhanced cooperation would result in significant cost reduction and simplification of the system for the users due to the central administration of the unitary patent and the simplified translation requirements. Today, the validation costs would be more than EUR 12 000 when protection in thirteen selected Member States is sought, Union-wide coverage would cost between EUR 22 000 to EUR 26 000 in validation costs. The translation costs under the simplified translation arrangements of enhanced cooperation would amount to approximately EUR 680 per patent. LEGAL BASE: enhanced cooperation is regulated by Article 20 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Articles 326 to 334 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This proposal is based on Article 329(1) TFEU. CONTENT: following the request of the twelve Member States, the purpose of this proposal is to authorise enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection. Once this enhanced cooperation has been authorised by the Council, specific measures will be proposed for its implementation. It is, however, appropriate to outline some key elements of the envisaged implementing measures. Since the creation of unitary patent protection is not possible without an agreement on the applicable translation arrangements, both the substantive provisions applicable to the unitary patent and the translation arrangements should be part of the envisaged implementing measures. The envisaged implementing measures should, therefore, include the following elements: 1) a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council creating unitary patent protection . That proposal could be based on the text agreed (general approach) in the Council in December 2009, as well as certain elements of the draft political orientation proposed by the Belgian Presidency, in particular: the unitary patent protection should be optional to the users of the patent system and should co-exist with national and European patents. The unitary patent should be a specific category of a European patent, granted by the European Patent Office, designating the Member States participating in enhanced cooperation on unitary basis; consequently, a single procedure in accordance with the EPC would apply to unitary patents and to all other European patents. Until the moment of grant, applicants would have the choice between i) a European patent valid in the territories of the participating Member States for which this patent would have unitary character, ii) a European patent valid in the territories of the participating Member States for which this patent would have unitary character but also designating selected other Contracting States of the EPC, or iii) a European patent designating only selected Contracting States of the EPC; the unitary patent should be of autonomous nature and provide equal protection throughout the territories of the participating Member States. It may only be granted, transferred, revoked or may lapse in respect of those territories as a whole. 2) a proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the unitary patent . This proposal would take over the main elements of the Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the EU patent, as well as certain elements of the draft political orientation proposed by the Belgian Presidency, in particular: it is envisaged that the specification of the unitary patent be published by the EPO in accordance with Article 14(6) EPC. Without prejudice to any transitional arrangements deemed necessary, no further translations would be required. Any additional translation requirements under such transitional arrangements would be proportionate and required only on a temporary basis and not have legal value thus ensuring legal certainty for the users of the patent system. In any case, transitional arrangements would terminate when high quality machine translations are made available, subject to an objective evaluation of the quality; translations should not have legal value , thus ensuring legal certainty for the users of the patent system; in case of a dispute relating to a unitary patent, a full manual translation of the patent specification would have to be provided by the patent proprietor at his expense a) into an official language of the Member State in which either the alleged infringement took place or in which the alleged infringer is domiciled (at the choice of the alleged infringer); and b) into the language of proceedings of the court hearing the dispute (at the request of the court). 3) a scheme for compensating the costs of translating patent applications filed in an official language of the Union into an official language of the EPO at the beginning of the procedure for applicants based in the Member States which have an official language other than one of the official languages of the EPO, should be set up in addition to what is currently in place for other European patents, including financial and technical assistance for preparing those translations."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the development of digital technologies and internet has transformed the distribution of and access to television and radio programmes, with 49% of European internet users (Eurostat estimate) accessing music, audiovisual content and games online. Broadcasters and retransmission service providers are increasingly investing in the development of digital and online services for the distribution of radio and television programmes. However, despite the growing variety of online services, broadcasters’ programmes often remain unavailable online to European citizens living in other Member States. In addition, the variety of TV and radio channels from other Member States provided by retransmission services differs across the EU. Broadcasting organisations transmit on a daily basis a high number of programmes that they license from others or produce themselves. These programmes incorporate a variety of protected content such as audiovisual, musical, literary or graphic works. This requires a complex clearance of rights with a multitude of right holders. Operators of retransmission services, which aggregate a high number of TV and radio channels into packages, also face difficulties for acquiring all the rights necessary to retransmit the television and radio programmes of broadcasting organisations. The Satellite and Cable Directive does not extend to retransmission services provided by means other than cable over closed electronic communication networks, such as IPTV (TV/radio over closed circuit IP-based networks). This proposal responds to one of the key objectives identified in the Digital Single Market Strategy: to enhance wider online access to TV and radio programmes by users across the EU. It is presented in parallel with: a proposal for a directive to modernise certain aspects of the Union copyright framework to take account of technological developments; and a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment examines two sets of policy options, aimed at facilitating the clearance of rights (i) for the online transmissions of TV and radio programmes; and (ii) for digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes: as regards online transmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application to broadcasters' online services which are ancillary to the initial broadcasts (notably simulcasting and catch-up services); as regards digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application of mandatory collective management of rights to IPTV retransmission services and other retransmission services provided over ""closed"" electronic communications networks, CONTENT: the draft regulation aims to promote the cross-border provision of online services ancillary to broadcasts and to facilitate digital retransmissions over closed networks of TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States by adapting the Union legal framework. The proposal defines the services covered by the measures (notably ""ancillary online services"" and ""retransmission"" services). These definitions will be applied in a uniform manner in the Union. The proposal concerns the facilitation of the clearance of rights for ancillary online services by broadcasting organisations by introducing a principle of country of origin, according to which the copyright relevant act takes place solely in the Member State where the broadcasting organisation is established. It also facilitates the clearance of rights for retransmission services provided over closed networks (other than cable), by introducing rules on mandatory collective management. By addressing the difficulties related to the clearance of rights, the proposal will promote consumers' access to more TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States, both as concerns ancillary online services of broadcasting organisations and retransmission services. The proposal provides that the Commission shall carry out a review of the Regulation and present a report on its main findings. It obliges Member States to provide the Commission with necessary information for the preparation of that report."

PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: BACKGROUND: the euro continues to be a target of organised crime groups active in the forgery of money. Counterfeiting of the euro has led to a financial damage of at least EUR 500 million since the introduction of the euro in 2002. Europol considers that there is a long-term trend towards an increase in the crime level and notes that the criminal threat remains serious. Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA on increasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro aims at supplementing, on the territory of European Union, the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1929 which lays down rules ensuring that severe criminal penalties and other sanctions can be imposed for offences of counterfeiting currency. Although all Member States have, with minor exceptions, formally implemented the Framework Decision correctly, Member States have adopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection and practices within their national legal systems. In particular, considerable differences exist with respect to the levels of sanctions which are applicable in the Member States to the main forms of counterfeiting. It is therefore essential to ensure that effective and efficient criminal law measures protect the euro and any other currency whose circulation is legally authorised in all Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the consultations of the interested parties. After considering the possible options, the impact assessment concludes that the following solution would be preferred: (i) maintenance of most of the provisions from Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA in a new proposal, with minor modifications, taking into account the Treaty of Lisbon; (ii) modification of the provisions on penalties; and (iii) introduction of a new provision obliging Member States to provide for the possibility to use certain investigative tools. LEGAL BASIS: Article 83 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of this Directive is to supplement the provisions and to facilitate the application of the Geneva Convention by the Member States. It builds on and updates Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA seeking to increase protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro. The proposal: · requires Member States to criminalise all forms of preparation and participation. Criminal responsibility for attempt is included for the majority of offences; · requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. For more serious cases of the offences of production and distribution of counterfeit currency, it sets out a sanction of imprisonment within a range of at least six months and eight years for natural persons; · requires Member States to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons, and to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions on legal persons; · requires jurisdiction of the judicial authorities which allow them to initiate investigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to currency counterfeiting; · obliges Member States whose currency is the euro to exercise universal jurisdiction on euro counterfeiting offences under certain conditions; · ensures that investigative tools which are provided for in national law for organised crime or other serious crime cases can also be used in cases of counterfeiting of currency; · requires from Member States to ensure that the National Analysis Centres and the National Coin Analysis Centres can analyse euro counterfeits also during on-going judicial proceedings for the purpose of detecting further counterfeits; · requests that Member States are contracting parties of the International Geneva Convention of 20 April 1929. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Budget of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission’s legislative proposals on the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 aimed to make the CAP more responsive to current and future challenges such as climate change or generational renewal, while continuing to support farmers in the Union for a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Those proposals are closely linked to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) of the Union for the years 2021 to 2027. The legislative procedure was not concluded in time to allow Member States and the Commission to prepare all elements necessary to apply the new legal framework and the CAP Strategic Plans as of 1 January 2021, as initially proposed by the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure that support can be granted to farmers and other beneficiaries from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in 2021, the Union should continue to grant such support for one more year under the conditions of the existing legal framework, which covers the period 2014 to 2020. CONTENT: this proposal aims at providing certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers and ensuring the continuity of support for rural development in the transitional period for those Member States that have used their 2014-2010 EAFRD allocations by extending the current legal framework until the new CAP becomes applicable. In order to allow Member States to make the necessary adaptations at national level, these changes would need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament by mid-2020 Extension of the applicability of the existing regulations The existing legal framework is laid down in particular in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013, (EU) No 1307/2013, (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In addition, to facilitate the transition from existing support schemes to the new legal framework which covers the period starting on 1 January 2022, rules shall be laid down to regulate how certain support granted on a multiannual basis will be integrated into the new legal framework. In light of the fact that the Union should continue to support rural development in 2021, Member States, that demonstrate the risk to run out of funds and not to be able to undertake new legal commitments in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, shall have the possibility to extend their rural development programmes or certain of their regional rural development programmes supported by the EAFRD to 31 December 2021 and to finance those extended programmes from the corresponding budget allocation for the year 2021. Transition to the next CAP period The new CAP comes with significant changes. Transitional rules are needed to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period, in particular concerning the continuation of multiannual commitments undertaken in the current and previous programming periods. The Single CMO Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, including aid schemes for specific sectors. It sets out the parameters for intervening on agricultural markets and providing sector-specific support. To ensure coherence, most interventions of the new CAP will be part of one strategic CAP support plan per Member State, including several sectorial interventions that have previously been set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Under the current rules, the different sectoral programmes follow different time frames. To ensure coherence, continuity and a smooth transition between the aid schemes under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the sectoral types of interventions under the new CAP it is necessary to set rules regarding the duration of each of these aid schemes with respect to the entry into application of the Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans. For aid schemes in the fruit and vegetables sector and in the olive oil and table olives sector, it is necessary to regulate the continuation and modification of operational programmes and work programmes. Budgetary implications The current Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 on rural development and (EU) No 1307/2013 on direct payments do not lay down allocations for the transitional period (beyond calendar year 2020). Therefore, the initiative has a budgetary impact in the sense that it adds the allocations for direct payments and rural development for the relevant transitional period to ensure smooth continuity. These allocations are equal to those in the CAP Plan proposal and they are coherent with the Commission’s proposal on the MFF 2021-2027. Where Member States do not decide to prolong their current rural development programmes, the 2021 EAFRD allocations will be transferred to the 2022 – 2025 EAFRD allocations. Similarly, for the transitional period, the allocations contained in Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 need to be adjusted to respect the overall amounts for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) included in the MFF proposal. The reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is proposed to be maintained throughout the transitional period to ensure continuity. It is to be financed through financial discipline applied on direct payments. As such, it does not entail any additional expenditure. The present proposal is neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments. The impact as regards the estimated schedule for payment appropriations will depend on Member States decisions as regards the prolongation of the current rural development programmes. Similarly, any decision of Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development will be neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments but may have an impact in terms of timing of payments that however cannot be estimated."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: The Union is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area based on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. The Budapest Convention on the contract for the carriage of goods by inland waterways (CMNI) is a valuable instrument for promoting inland navigation across Europe. The Convention has been adopted by the Diplomatic Conference organised jointly by the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine and the Danube Commission in collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The Budapest Convention is not open to participation by regional economic integration organisations. As a result, the Union is not in a position to become a Contracting Party to the Budapest Convention. Eleven of the Member States of the Union, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia are Contracting Parties to the Budapest Convention. Belgium ratified the Convention on 5 August 2008. Austria and Poland, which have navigable inland waterways coming within the scope of the Convention, expressed their interest in becoming Contracting Parties. The remaining Member States of the Union indicated that they do not have inland waterways covered by the Budapest Convention and thus they do not have an interest in ratifying or acceding to the Convention. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council authorise Austria and Poland to ratify or to accede to, the Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI). The Convention, which entered into force on 1 April 2005, has proven to be a great success and contributes to the internal market in the field of transport. It aims to harmonise contractual and inland navigational standards among European countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: by Decision of 30 November 2009, the Council concluded the agreement between the European Community and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver. Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition. With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with Barbados were successfully finalised by the initialling of the amending agreement on 8 February 2017. CONTENT: this proposal is presented to the Council to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement between the European Community and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver. The amendments introduced by the final agreement cover the following points: Duration of stay: the final agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Barbados when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). A joint statement on the interpretation of the 90-day period over any 180-day period is attached to the amending agreement. Suspension of the agreement: the agreement provides that suspension of the waiver shall be lifted if the suspension is no longer required. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Community and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver remain unaffected by the amending agreement, including the territorial scope. The provisions of the agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals setting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and accused persons. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings; (ii) a directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. This measure is presented together with a Commission Recommendation on the right to legal aid for suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings. By establishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects or accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the mutual trust of judicial authorities and can thus help improve mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment in support of its proposal. CONTENT :the draft directive aims to: ·  ensure the effectiveness of the right of access to a lawyer at an early stage in the criminal proceedings for suspects and accused persons deprived of liberty; ·  ensure that requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings have access to legal aid to ensure the right of access to a lawyer in both the executing and issuing Member State (""right of dual defence""). The directive will apply from the deprivation of liberty, i.e. as from the moment one is taken into police custody or similar custody, which also covers periods before formal charge and arrest has taken place. Provisional legal aid : it is in the early phase of the proceedings, especially if deprived of liberty, that suspects or accused persons will be the most vulnerable and most in need of legal aid to be assisted by a lawyer. Therefore, the draft directive makes provisions for provisional legal aid. The proposal states the exercise of the right to provisional legal aid and access to a lawyer must become practicable and effective without undue delay after deprivation of liberty and before any questioning. The right to provisional legal aid should last at least until the competent authority has made the final decision on whether the suspect or accused person is eligible and benefits from legal aid. The right to provisional legal aid also applies to requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings who are deprived of liberty. Legal aid for requested persons : in order to improve mutual trust and make the right to dual defence in European arrest warrant proceedings effective (in both the executing and issuing Member State), the Directive also requires Member States to give access to legal aid, beyond provisional legal aid as the requested persons are not always deprived of liberty. In the period leading up to the final decision on whether the requested person benefits from legal aid in the executing Member State, requested persons that are deprived of liberty are entitled to provisional legal aid in the executing Member State Non-regression clause : the proposal aims to ensure that setting common minimum standards does not have the effect of lowering existing higher standards in certain Member States and the standards in the Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights."
8153EP8,"""""CO2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles""""",0.129,0.127,0.98,0.375,0.154,0.821,0.864,0.788,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to set mission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European strategy for low-emission mobility sets a clear ambition: by mid-century, greenhouse gas emissions from transport will need to be at least 60% lower than in 1990 and be firmly on the path towards zero. Emissions of air pollutants from transport that harm our health need also to be drastically reduced without delay. Light-duty vehicles (LDV) – passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (vans) - are already delivering their share of emission reductions and legislation has been proposed in 2017 so that they continue doing so after 2020. Lorries carry around 70% of freight transported over land, delivering also essential public services. While CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), i.e. lorries, buses and coaches, account for about 6% of total EU emissions and 25% of road transport CO2 emissions in the EU, they are currently not regulated at EU level. This poses three main problems: without any further action, CO2 emissions from HDV are projected to grow by 9% over the period 2010– 2030 due to increasing transport activities ; transport operators, mainly SMEs or micro enterprises, and their clients currently miss out on possible fuel savings and reduced fuel bills; EU HDV manufacturers face increasing global competitive pressures as the United States, Canada, Japan and China have already implemented regulatory measures to reduce HDV CO2 emissions. However, it is necessary for the EU car industry to keep up with the technological improvements introduced in these markets. This proposal is part of the third ‘Europe on the move’ package which delivers the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017. The aim of the package is to make European mobility safer and more accessible, European industry more competitive, European jobs more secure and the mobility system cleaner and better adapted to the imperative of tackling climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options considered in the impact assessment are grouped into five key elements, aimed to address the identified problems and achieve the policy objectives: (i) EU fleet-wide CO2 emission targets; (ii) distribution of EU fleet-wide target across vehicle groups and manufacturers; (iii) incentives for zero and low-emission vehicles; (iv) elements for cost-effective implementation; and (v) governance related issues. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation sets CO2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles whereby the specific CO2 emissions from the EU fleet of new heavy-duty vehicles are reduced compared to the reference CO2 emissions as follows: from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2029 by 15 %; from 1 January 2030 by at least 30 %, subject to review in 2022. The targets are set as a relative reduction of the average specific emissions of the vehicles registered in the reference year 2019 which is the first year for which official monitored CO2 emissions data will be available. The targets are attributed to each vehicle sub-group as defined in Section 1 of Annex I. In addition, the proposal: · defines the vehicles that fall within the scope of this Regulation by reference to the relevant categories defined in type approval legislation and to the four vehicle groups for which certified CO2 emissions data will be available from 2019 onwards; · provides that the Commission shall determine and publish annually the average specific CO2 emissions of each manufacturer starting from 2019 on the database provided by the relevant manufacturers; incentivises the deployment of zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles, those vehicles shall be counted multiple times for the purpose of determining a manufacturer’s average specific emissions starting from 2019. A specific incentive is also provided for zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles of the categories M2 (buses) and M3 (coaches) as well as certain category N vehicles (small lorries), including zero-emission vocational vehicles; provides for the calculation of annual manufacturer specific emission targets for the preceding calendar year, starting in 2026. The first annual targets will therefore be determined for the calendar year 2025; sets out a ‘banking and borrowing’ mechanism, allowing a manufacturer to balance an underachievement of its specific emission target in one year by the overachievement in another year. For that purpose, the manufacturer may ‘bank’ emission credits, if its emissions are lower than a reduction trajectory determined as a linear trajectory from the 2019 reference CO2 emissions to the 2025 targets and from the 2025 targets; imposes financial penalties in case of non-compliance with the specific CO2 emission targets. The level of the premium is set at EUR 6 800 per g/tkm, equivalent to EUR 570 per g/km based on an average payload of 12 tonnes, of excess emissions which reflect the marginal cost of CO2 reducing technologies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary impact resulting from the implementation of the proposed Regulation is very limited. It is estimated at EUR 1.888 million for the years 2019-2020."
4144EP7,"""""Mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters""""",0.07,0.916,0.912,0.419,0.515,0.904,0.851,0.714,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure the mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters in order to strengthening victims' rights in the EU. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that in a common area of freedom, security and justice, victims of (for example, domestic) violence or persons whose physical and/or psychological integrity or liberty is at risk and who benefit from a protection measure taken in one Member State should benefit from the same level of protection in other Member States should they move or travel, without going through expensive and time consuming procedures. This proposal is part of a legislative package which aims at strengthening the rights of victims in the EU and which also includes the following other elements: a communication on the strengthening of victims' rights in the EU; a directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. The European Union has already acted on the rights of victims in criminal proceedings through Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. Whilst improvements have been achieved on victims' rights, the objectives of the Council Framework decision have not been fully realised. In September 2009, 12 Member States put forward a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order. During the negotiations, it appeared that the mechanisms used in this instrument, based on Article 82 TFUE dealing with mutual recognition in criminal matters, is not compatible with the ambitious standard of mutual recognition already reached for civil matters, covered by Article 81 TFUE. In its resolution of 26 November 2009  on the elimination of violence against women the European Parliament calls on the Member States to improve their national laws and policies to combat all forms of violence against women and to act in order to tackle the causes of violence against women, not least by employing preventive measures and calls on the Union to guarantee the right to assistance, protection and support for all victims of violence. The present proposal therefore aims at completing a legal instrument on the mutual recognition of protection measures taken in criminal matters to ensure that all protection measures taken in a Member State benefit from an efficient mechanism to ensure their free circulation throughout the EU. Such action also replies to the Commission's call to further dismantle the obstacles to citizens' rights, set out in its Citizenship Report of 27 October 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission first hosted an experts' meeting on 25 May 2010 which confirmed that many Member State have put civil law protection measures in place, the mutual recognition of which should follow the common standards used in civil matters, rather than the more heavy procedures which are common standard in criminal matters. The European Commission also contracted an external Study to assist with the impact assessment in identifying the needs of victims of crime, which measures could be established to meet these needs and to examine the impacts of any possible options. The Commission held a public consultation from 15 July 2010 to 30 September 2010, open to all members of the public as well as to nongovernmental and governmental organisations asking their views on what action the EU should take to improve the situation of victims of crime, including in the field of protection orders. A further study was contracted to examine options in relation to the specific objective of ensuring that the protection gained through a protection order is not lost when a protected person travels or moves to another Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2)(a), (e) and (f) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: to protect victims of violence, in particular domestic violence, stalking or violence against children, the national laws of the Member States provide for the possibility to adopt temporary and preventative measures with a view to protecting a person when a serious risk exists to consider the persons physical and/or psychological integrity or liberty at risk. Protection measures are issued by a judicial or other authority upon request of the person at risk. Many of them are ordered without the person causing the risk being summoned to appear, in particular in case of urgency (""ex parte"" procedures). Protection measures are issued by a judicial or other authority upon request of the person at risk. Due to the increase of free movement more persons are moving or travelling abroad. Consequently, it is extremely important to ensure that such a temporary protection provided in one Member State is maintained when a person travels or moves to another Member State without having to go through time-consuming procedures. This proposal is a mutual recognition instrument in civil matters and as such it follows the rationale of existing EU instruments on judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters, from which it takes broad inspiration. More specifically, this proposal provides for a speedy and efficient mechanism to ensure that the Member State to which the person at risk moves will recognise the protection measure issued by the first Member State without any intermediate formalities. As for other mutual recognition instruments in civil matters, this proposal introduces a standardised certificate which contains all information relevant for the recognition and, where applicable, enforcement. Therefore, a certificate will be issued by the competent authority of the first Member State, either ex-officio or on request of the protected person, who will then contact the competent authorities in the second Member State and provide them with the certificate. The competent authorities of the second Member State will notify the person causing the risk about the geographical extension of the foreign protection measure, the sanctions applicable in case of its violation and, where applicable, ensure its enforcement. The proposal provides for the abolition of intermediate procedures and no grounds for refusal have been proposed, except for the existence of an irreconcilable decision in the Member State of recognition. Automatic recognition also applies when the Member State of recognition and/or enforcement does not have protection measures in civil matters. The abolition of intermediate procedures will be accompanied by fundamental rights safeguards: the authority of the first Member State which will be requested to issue the certificate will have to check that the right to a fair trial, in particular the right of defence, of the person causing the risk has been respected. In case such rights have not been guaranteed, the certificate cannot be issued; in case of suspension of withdrawal of the protection measure by the first Member State, the competent authority of the second Member State has, at request of the person causing the risk, to suspend or withdraw its recognition and, when applied, enforcement; the competent authorities of both Member States have to bring to the notice of the person causing the risk and to the protected person any information related to the issuing, recognition, possible enforcement and sanctions, suspension or withdrawal of the protection measure. The proposal does not deal with criminal sanctions put in place by Member States in case of violation of a protection measure. This question will continue to be dealt with by the national law of each Member State. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Ukraine relations continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. An Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine, providing for a deep and comprehensive free trade area, entered into force on 1 September 2017. Since spring 2014, Ukraine has been carrying out an ambitious reform programme aimed at stabilising its economy and improving the living conditions of its population. The fight against corruption as well as constitutional, electoral and judicial reforms are among the main priorities. The implementation of these reforms has been supported by five consecutive macro-financial assistance programmes, under which Ukraine has received loans totalling EUR 5 billion over the period 2014-2021. In order to allow for greater policy flexibility in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement with Ukraine in June 2020 for an amount equivalent to USD 5 billion. The Ukrainian economy has been affected by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the persistent security threats on the country's border with Russia. Inflation accelerated and reached 10% by the end of 2021. The worsening geopolitical tensions on Ukraine's border with Russia have had a profound impact on confidence, particularly among foreign investors. According to the latest IMF projections, the lack of access to capital markets is expected to widen the country's funding gap by at least USD 2.5 billion in 2022 and significantly increase risks to the country's macroeconomic outlook. It is against this background of increased geopolitical uncertainty, which prevents Ukraine from accessing international capital markets and affects its economic situation, that the Commission is presenting a proposal to provide Ukraine with new MFA in the form of loans to foster stability in the country. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the EU makes available to Ukraine macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 1.2 billion with a view to facilitating macroeconomic stabilisation and the implementation of a comprehensive reform programme. The planned emergency MFA, put forward to provide swift support in a situation of acute crisis and to strengthen the resilience of the country, will have a duration of 12 months and include two disbursements: - the release of the first tranche, subject to the political precondition and a satisfactory implementation of the IMF programme, would occur swiftly after the approval of this proposal, upon entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on specific structural policy measures, agreed between the European Commission on behalf of the EU and Ukraine; - the disbursement of the second tranche would be linked to the continuous satisfactory implementation of both an IMF programme and the policy measures agreed in the MoU. The MoU underpinning this emergency macro-financial assistance operation is likely to focus on a limited number of feasible, short-term policy actions in the most urgent priority areas, such as strengthening economic resilience and stability, governance and rule of law, and energy. The implementation of the proposed operation is expected to go hand-in-hand with the support under budgetary operations financed by the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The announced additional allocation of EUR 120 million in NDICI grants will be important to further strengthen Ukraine’s state-building and resilience efforts. A pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems and promote structural reforms aimed at supporting sustainable and inclusive growth, decent employment creation and fiscal consolidation. Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service. In order for the European Parliament and the Council to follow the implementation of this decision, the Commission will have to inform them regularly on developments related to the assistance. Budgetary implications The proposed macro-financial assistance operation in favour of Ukraine would be disbursed in two equal instalments, to be disbursed over 12 months. These funds will be borrowed on the capital market and then lent to Ukraine. The loan will benefit from the external action guarantee. The required provisioning (corresponding to 9% of the loan amount) will be provided under the Neighbourhood, Development Cooperation and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 108 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. CONTENT: the present Commission proposal for a Council decision aims at formally concluding the compensatory agreements reached between the European Union and several WTO Members in order to obtain a consolidated GATS schedule of specific commitments covering all the Member States who were members of the European Union in 2006. The terms and conditions under which WTO Members commit access to their market to the services and service suppliers of other WTO Members are specified in their GATS schedules of specific commitments. The original schedule of specific commitments of the European Union and its Member States (‘the EU GATS schedule’) dates back to 1994, and only covers those twelve Member States who were members of the European Union at that time. The thirteen Member States that have joined the European Union in 1995 and 2004 continued to maintain their individual GATS schedules, which were adopted prior to their accession to the European Union. In order to ensure that those thirteen Member States did not maintain commitments which would be in breach of the acquis communautaire and that they were covered by the horizontal limitations included in the EU GATS schedule, it was necessary to notify the modification and withdrawal of certain specific commitments included in the EU GATS schedule and in the individual GATS schedules of the thirteen Member States concerned, and to consolidate those individual schedules with the EU GATS schedule. To this end, on 28 May 2004, the European Union notified to the WTO the modification and withdrawal of certain commitments included in the EU GATS schedule and in the GATS schedules of the thirteen Member States concerned. The European Union subsequently entered into negotiations with eighteen WTO Members, who claimed to be affected by these modifications and withdrawals, under Article XXI of GATS. In the course of such negotiations, in accordance with the Council Conclusions of 26 July 2006, the European Union agreed on the compensation to be offered to the affected WTO Members. The notified modifications and withdrawals, together with the agreed compensatory adjustments, were incorporated into a consolidated EU GATS schedule, the certification of which was concluded pursuant to the applicable WTO rules on 15 December 2006. Thereby, the European Union became the first member of the World Trade Organization that successfully used the GATS provisions on the modification and withdrawal of commitments. As a result of the successful consolidation of the EU GATS schedule, its services commitments could be presented in a single document covering its, at that time, twenty five Member States (hereafter ‘the EU25 consolidated schedule’). The agreed compensatory adjustments constituted a satisfactory and balanced outcome of the negotiations and should therefore be approved on behalf of the European Union. Accordingly, on 27 March 2007, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Agreements. On 23 July 2007, the Council agreed on the text of a draft decision of the Council and of the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council approving the conclusion of the Agreements on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. On 11 October 2007 the Parliament, in a consultation procedure, approved the conclusion of the Agreements. At this stage, the Council has not yet approved the conclusion of the Agreements, which have not been ratified by all the Member States concerned. The fact that the Agreements have not yet been formally concluded is hindering the consolidation process of the EU GATS schedule regarding the Member States having joined the European Union after 2006, since the WTO Members who claimed to be affected by the modifications of the schedules of those Member States refuse to engage in this process until the legal status of the Agreements had been clarified."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the two-way carriage of passengers and goods by road between Switzerland and the EU is regulated by the Land Transport Agreement between the EU and Switzerland ('EU Agreement'). Under the EU Agreement, the transport of passengers by coach and bus between two points situated on the territory of the same Contracting Party by carriers established in the territory of the other Contracting Party, known as cabotage, is not authorised. This means that the carriers operating the passenger services which cross the border can only carry passengers across the border or within the territory of the Contracting Party they are established in. Bus and coach operators established in Switzerland may not carry passengers between two points on the German side of the border and operators established in the EU may not carry passengers between two points on the Swiss side of the border. However, Article 20(2) of the EU Agreement specifically allows pre-existing rights under bilateral agreements concluded between individual EU Member States and Switzerland that were in force at the time of conclusion of the EU Agreement to continue to be exercised. The border regions of Italy and Switzerland are closely integrated. Many Italians commute to work in Switzerland and vice versa and there is vibrant cross-border passenger traffic by road. A number of bus and coach services are offered which cross the border and thus connect the border regions of the two countries. By letter dated 7 February 2018, Italy informed the Commission that it would like to negotiate and conclude an agreement with Switzerland which authorises cabotage operations during the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between the two countries. Switzerland informed the Commission that it was also interested in concluding such an agreement. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to empower Italy to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the respective border regions of Italy and Switzerland in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between the two countries, provided that there is no discrimination between carriers established in the Union and no distortion of competition. Cabotage operations allow increasing the load factor of the vehicles which increases the economic efficiency of the services. The authorisation of cabotage operations in the context of the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between Italy and Switzerland would allow the carriers involved to become more competitive and efficient. This could further strengthen the close integration of these border regions. In order to ensure that the cabotage operations concerned do not excessively alter the functioning of the internal market for coach and bus services, as established by Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, their authorisation should be subject to the conditions that there is no discrimination between carriers established within the Union and no distortion of competition. For the same reason, cabotage operations should only be authorised in the border regions of Italy in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between Italy and Switzerland. As border regions of Italy shall be considered the regions Piedmont and Lombardy and the autonomous regions Valle d'Aosta and TrentinoAlto Adige. This proposal is based on a request by Germany and concerns only this Member State. A similar request has been received by Italy which is subject to a parallel procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an environment marked by the emergence of new threats, such as hybrid and cyber-attacks, and the return of more conventional dangers, EU citizens and their political leaders agree that the EU should collectively take more responsibility for its security. The defence sector is largely fragmented across national borders , with considerable duplication, resulting in inefficiencies that prevent economies of scale. At the same time, the cost of defence equipment and in particular R&D costs have increased, while cooperation between Member States on investment in R&D and defence equipment has remained limited. In 2015, only 16% of defence equipment was procured through European collaborative procurement. In June 2017, the Commission adopted a communication launching the European Defence Fund consisting of 'windows' for research and for capability. The communication was accompanied by a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing the European defence industrial development programme under the capability window. A two-step approach was proposed, involving: an initial test period under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework during which a preparatory action on defence research supports collaborative defence research, while the proposed European defence industrial development programme shall co-finance collaborative development projects; and a dedicated fund under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework scaling up the funding for collaborative research in innovative defence products and technologies and for subsequent stages of the development cycle, including the development of prototypes. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - concerns the establishment of the European defence fund under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 with a view to fostering the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European defence industry and technological base and thus contributing to the strategic autonomy of the Union. The new fund shall promote cooperation between Member States and contribute to cost savings in the production of interoperable and advanced defence technologies and equipment. Its objective shall be: support collaborative research projects that could significantly boost the performance of future capabilities, aiming at maximising innovation and introducing new defence products and technologies, including disruptive ones; support collaborative development projects of defence products and technologies consistent with defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It shall contribute to greater efficiency of defence spending within the Union, achieving greater economies of scale, reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication and as such reducing the fragmentation of defence products and technologies throughout the Union. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation shall enable the Commission to set up a financing programme, implemented mainly through grants awarded following annual calls for proposals. Cross-border participation of SMEs and mid-cap companies shall be encouraged by offering higher financing rates. To be eligible, actions shall, in principle, be carried out in cooperation between at least three legal entities based in at least three different Member States and/or associated countries. Furthermore, the EU shall only co-finance the development of common prototypes if Member States commit themselves to buying the final product. Once assessed as eligible, a 'PESCO bonus', in the form of a higher funding rate, shall be granted to eligible permanent structured cooperation in defence projects. The fund shall also take into account defence activities implemented through the European peace facility, an off-budget instrument proposed outside the multi-annual financial framework. Proposed budget : the Fund shall have an overall budget of EUR 13 billion (at current prices) for the period 2021-2027, of which: Up to 5% of the financial envelope shall be devoted to support disruptive technologies for defence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation 861/2007 established an alternative procedure in addition to the procedures existing under the laws of the Member States, for cross-border cases concerning claims which do not exceed EUR 2 000. The Regulation is applied in the EU (except in Denmark) as of 1 January 2009. Despite the benefits it could bring in terms of reducing the costs and time of litigating cross-border claims, the procedure is still little known and remains under-used several years after the entry into application of the Regulation. A Eurobarometer survey carried out in 2012, showed that 12% of the respondents were aware of the existence of the ESCP, with 1% of all respondents declaring that they already used the procedure. 69% of those who already used the procedure were satisfied. The survey also showed that the most important factors which would encourage citizens to go to court are: the possibility of carry out proceedings in writing without appearing in the court (33%), conducting proceedings without instructing a lawyer (26%), conducting proceedings on-line (20%) and using their own language (24%). The European Parliament affirmed in a 2011 resolution that more needs to be done in terms of legal certainty, language barriers and transparency of proceedings. It called on the Commission to take steps to ensure that consumers and businesses are made more aware and make use of existing legislative instruments, such as the European Small Claims Procedure. The Commission identified the revision of the Regulation in its 2013 EU Citizenship Report as one of the actions strengthening the rights of Union citizens, by facilitating the settlement of disputes regarding purchases made in another Member State. This initiative is included in the European Consumer Agenda. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: having carried out several consultations of interested parties, the Commission also undertook an impact assessment in support of its proposal. CONTENT : the Commission proposes to revise Regulation (EC) nº 861/2007 as follows: Extend the scope of the Regulation to cross-border claims up to EUR 10,000: raising the current threshold will allow parties to litigate a substantially bigger number of cases on the basis of the simplified European procedure. SMEs will be the main beneficiaries, but consumers will also benefit, since about one fifth of consumer claims exceed EUR 2,000. Extend the definition of cross border cases : the amendment means that the European Small Claim Procedure may be used in disputes involving parties domiciled in the same Member State which have a significant cross-border element and includes third-country residents. Improve the use of electronic means of communication , including for service of documents: the proposal will put postal service and electronic service on the same footing. For other, less important communications between the parties and the courts, the proposal will make electronic communication the rule, subject only to the agreement of the parties. Impose an obligation on courts to use videoconferencing, teleconferencing or other means of distance communication for the conduct of oral hearings and taking of evidence: oral hearings should be conducted through videoconferencing or other means of distance communication. In order to safeguard the rights of the parties, an exception will be made for the party who expressly requests to be present in court. Provide a maximum limitation on court fees charged for the procedure: the proposed amendment will not harmonise court fees in the Member States. Instead, it would set a maximum cap on court fees for applications under the Regulation, increasing the attractiveness of the procedure for claimants. The measure allows Member States to maintain a fixed minimum court fee. Provide for an obligation on the Member States to put in place on-line means of payment of court fees : when payment in cash or stamps is the only acceptable means of payment, parties may be discouraged from pursuing their claims. The proposal aims at obliging Member States to put in place distance means of payment, as a minimum bank transfers and credit/debit card on-line payment systems. Limit the requirement to translate the certificate of enforcement in Form D to only the substance of the judgment: the obligation to translate Form D imposes unnecessary costs. The amendment will limit the requirement of translation to the substance of the judgment in point 4.3 of Form D only. Impose information obligations on Member States in respect of court fees, methods of payment of court fees and the availability of assistance in filling in the forms. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only implications for the budget of the European Union resulting from the proposed Regulation consist of the one-off costs for the preparation of a report 5 years after the date of application of the Regulation. The operational and administrative costs are estimated at EUR 437, 000 for the period 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: for the next multiannual financial framework covering the period 2021-2017, the Commission proposes to modernise cohesion policy to help redress imbalances within and between Member States. Based on the evidence that t he applicable rules were overly complex and fragmented between the different funds and the various forms of financing, the Commission proposed to establish a single rulebook for seven EU funds implemented under shared management in order to simplify access to and use of EU Funds (Common Provisions Regulation - CPR). The aims of the ERDF is to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions. The Cohesion Fund contributes financially to projects in the field of the environment and trans-European transport infrastructure networks. In many countries, the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund represent at least 50% of public investment - these Member States would not otherwise have the financial capacity to make such investments. There is considerable potential for spill-over effects across national and regional borders, for example in terms of investment in innovation and SMEs. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - sets out the provisions applicable to both ERDF and Cohesion Fund intervening under the ‘Investment for jobs and growth’ goal and, with regard to the ERDF, under the ‘European territorial cooperation’ goal (Interreg). Objectives for ERDF and Cohesion Fund : the ERDF shall support the achievement of the following policy objectives (PO): a smarter Europe through innovation, digitisation, industrial change and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (PO 1); a greener, low-carbon Europe, investing in energy transition, renewable energy and the fight against climate change (PO 2); a more connected Europe with strategic transport and digital communication networks (PO 3); a more social Europe, which will support quality jobs, education, skills, social inclusion and equal access to health care (PO 4); a Europe closer to citizens, which will support locally driven development strategies and sustainable urban development across the European Union (PO 5). The Cohesion Fund shall support PO 2 and specific objectives under PO 3 in particular the development of a sustainable, climate resilient, intelligent, secure and intermodal TEN-T as well as promoting sustainable multimodal urban mobility. Operations under the ERDF are expected to contribute 30 % of the overall financial envelope of the ERDF to climate objectives (37% under the Cohesion Fund). Landfills, airport infrastructure, the tobacco industry, decommissioning of nuclear facilities shall not be supported by the funds. Thematic concentration : in the current context of budget cuts, the proposed Regulation provides that the majority of ERDF and Cohesion Fund investments shall be geared towards the first two objectives: a smarter Europe (PO 1) and a greener Europe (PO 2). Member States shall invest between 65% and 85% of their resources under the two funds in these priority areas, depending on their income ratio: countries with GNI above 100% of the EU average shall allocate at least 85% of their ERDF resources to PO 1 and 2, and at least 60% to PO 1; countries with GNI between 75% and 100% of the EU average shall allocate at least 45% of their ERDF resources to PO 1 and at least 30% to PO 2; countries with a GNI below 75% of the EU average should allocate at least 35% of their ERDF resources to PO 1 and at least 30% to PO 2. This thematic concentration shall be attained at national level, with some flexibility at the level of individual programmes and between the three groups of Member States formed according to their gross national income. Scope of the funds : the ERDF shall support the following: (a) investments in infrastructure; (b) investments in access to services; (c) productive investments in SMEs; (d) equipment, software and intangible assets; (e) information, communication, studies, networking, cooperation, exchange of experience and activities involving clusters; (f) technical assistance; the Cohesion Fund shall support the following: (a) investments in the environment, including investments related to sustainable development and energy presenting environmental benefits; (b) investments in TEN-T; (c) technical assistance. Indicators : in order to ensure consistent monitoring of progress achieved, the proposed Regulation refines the common set of output indicators, while adding for the first time a common set of results indicators. These latter enable reporting results in real time on the Open Data Platform and comparison across programmes and Member States. Evaluations will include lessons learned, problems and opportunities to further improve the actions and their impacts. Specific territorial factors : the proposal provides for an increased focus on sustainable urban development by dedicating 6% of ERDF resources to this area, delivered through territorial instruments. It also provides for the setting up of a European Urban Initiative to be managed by the Commission. The proposal also sets out special measures to accommodate the specific situation of outermost regions. These include schemes to offset transport costs and investments. Proposed overall budget : the Commission proposal for a multiannual financial framework provides for an envelope of EUR 273 billion for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2021-2027, of which: (i) ERDF: EUR 200.62 billion and; (ii) Cohesion Fund: EUR 41.34 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal seeks to address the EU’s need for a stronger Europe when it comes to foreign policy to better contribute to supporting development and securing peace and prosperity in the world. The Commission stated that it is essential to support security sector actors, including the military under exceptional circumstances, in third countries in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development. Those actions are particularly necessary to ensure the protection of civilian populations in the areas affected by conflict, crises or fragility. The 2005 European Consensus on Development recognised the link between security and development. The United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015, underlined the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies both as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 16) and in order to achieve other development policy outcomes. In the Joint Communication entitled ‘Capacity building in support of security and development – Enabling partners to prevent and manage crisis’, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy reiterated the need for stable and secure societies in order to achieve development objectives The Council conclusions on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of 18 May 2015 called to explore options to: (i) enhance coherence and coordination between EU security and development actions, as well as to; (ii) improve the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development, notably in terms of financing instruments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that an amendment of the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) would be the most appropriate and effective short-term option. It also explained that a comprehensive implementation of the CBSD initiative (i.e. including support to the military for defence-related purposes) would require combining a budgetary instrument (for development tasks) with another, possibly extra-budgetary, mechanism. CONTENT: the proposal aims to insert a new Article into Title II of Regulation (EU) No 230/2014 in order to extend the Union’s assistance under exceptional circumstances to be used to build the capacity of military actors. The specific objectives of the proposal are to: contribute to improving the capacity of partner countries to prevent and manage crises by themselves; contribute to improving the effectiveness of the Union’s development actions by working with all security actors, including the military, through the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development by the EU, as soon as possible, flexibly and comprehensively; contribute to ensuring the respect of the rule of law, good governance as well as enhanced civilian control and oversight over the military in third countries. Types of Union assistance : Union assistance may be used to build the capacity of military actors in partner countries under exceptional circumstances, in order to contribute to sustainable development and in particular to the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies. The type of activities that may be supported include capacity building programmes in support of security and development, including training, mentoring and advice, as well as the provision of equipment, infrastructure improvements and provision of other services. Union assistance shall not be used to finance: (i) recurrent military expenditure; (ii) the procurement of arms and ammunition; (iii) training which is solely designed to contribute to the fighting capacity of the armed forces. Exceptional circumstances : assistance shall only be provided in the following circumstances: where requirements cannot be met by recourse to non-military actors to adequately reach Union objectives under this Regulation; where the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies is denied by a serious threat to the existence of functioning State institutions, as well as to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, or State institutions can no longer cope with this serious threat; and where a consensus exists between the country concerned and the international community and/or the European Union that the security sector, and in particular the military, are key for stability, peace and development, particularly in crises and fragile contexts and situations. When designing and implementing measures, the Commission shall: (i) promote ownership by the partner country; (ii) develop the necessary elements and the good practices required for ensuring sustainability in the medium and long term and; (iii) promote the rule of law and established international law principle. Monitoring and evaluation procedures : Union assistance may be provided through exceptional assistance measures and interim response programmes, thematic strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes. Thematic strategy papers shall provide a framework for cooperation between the Union and the partner countries or regions concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in terms of cost, a budget of EUR 100 000 000 over the period 2017-2020 would be required. The initiative will be financed through redeployment within Heading IV of the general budget of the Union. No additional resources would be mobilised. Implementation will be governed by Regulation (EU) No 236/2014."
3630EP7,"""""Sound level of motor vehicles""""",0.842,0.817,0.0,0.548,0.273,0.88,0.128,0.171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure a high level of health and environmental protection and to safeguard the Internal Market for motor vehicles as regards their sound level. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 70/157/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles harmonised the different technical requirements of Member States relating to the permissible sound level of motor vehicles and of their exhaust systems for the purpose of the establishment and operation of the internal market. For the purposes of the good functioning of the internal market and in order to ensure a uniform and consistent application throughout the Union, it is appropriate to replace that Directive by a Regulation. As more information about the health impacts of noise became available, the need for a higher level of protection of EU citizens through further EU-wide measures became more imminent. The European Commission Green Paper on Noise from 1996 estimated that around 20% of the then EU population suffered from noise levels that scientists and health experts consider to be unacceptable. Based on information from EU Member States, the European Environment Agency has estimated, that half of the population in urban areas is exposed to noise levels above 55 dB(A) as a result of ambient road noise. Over the years, considerable research effort, including large EU-funded projects, has been dedicated to the quantitative assessment of the relationship between environmental noise and its effects. Although the approaches and the scope of the various studies differ, common ground can be found in the terms of harmful effects and annoyance that noise generates. These findings have been confirmed by the 2008 WHO-report. The Communication from the European Commission regarding a European strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles announced that the European Commission will present a proposal in 2011 to amend the respective legislation to reduce the noise emissions of vehicles. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: different options were considered for the proposal which covered environmental, social and economic aspects: Option 1 : No change - the current limit values together with the allowances will remain valid, as well as the old measurement method; Option 2 : New method - old limit values (the new measurement method will be combined with the current set of limit values); Option 3 : New method – new limit values equivalent to old ones; Option 4 : New method – new limit values with noise reduction potential; Option 5 : New method – new limit values with noise reductions potential in a two step approach. According to the most preferable option (Option 5) , the limit values for light and medium size vehicles will be lowered in two steps of each 2 dB(A) and for heavy vehicles in a first step of 1 and a second step of 2 dB(A). This will result in a reduction of the noise impact of about 3 dB(A) for free flowing traffic and up to 4 dB(A) for intermittent traffic. The reduction of the number of highly annoyed people will be 25 %. The cost-benefit ratio for this measure is estimated to be around 20 times in favour of the noise reduction compared to no action taken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft proposal will repeal Directive 70/157/EEC and its subsequent amendments. It aims to update the requirements for the type-approval system as regards the sound level of motor vehicles and of their exhaust systems. In particular, it introduces a new test method for noise emissions measurement, lowers noise limit values and introduces additional sound emission provisions in the EU type-approval procedure. A more ambitious final target for noise reduction shall be pursued. This would be achieved in two stages: the first step is a reduction of 2 dB(A) for light vehicles and 1 dB(A) for heavy vehicles and can be introduced two years after the date of publication of the present proposal; the second step is a reduction of 2 dB(A) for light vehicles and 2 dB(A) for heavy vehicles. It will require more development effort and a more drastic set of technical measures: according to the contractor, this step could be introduced two years after the first step. The total reduction would be 4 dB(A) for light vehicles and 3 dB(A) for heavy vehicles. The draft proposal will lay down new requirements: new test protocol, new limit values, additional sound emission provisions and minimum noise for electric and electric-hybrid vehicles. It is proposed to amend the noise legislation with an Annex harmonising the performance of 'Approaching Vehicle Audible Systems' if they are fitted to a vehicle. The fitting of such systems however shall be voluntary and remain an option under the discretion of the vehicle manufacturers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2013/36/EU and 2009/110/EC and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress and integration of retail payments in the EU have been achieved over the past 12 years, with the current regulatory and legislative acquis on payments. Moreover, the retail payments market is very dynamic and has experienced a significant innovation pace in the last few years. At the same time, important areas of the payments market, especially card payments and new means of payments, such as internet and mobile payments, are often still fragmented along national borders making it difficult for innovative and easy-to-use digital payment services to develop efficiently and to provide consumers and retailers with convenient and secure payment methods. The review of the European framework and notably Directive 2007/64/EC on the Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the consultation on the Commission Green Paper ‘Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments’ in 2012 have led to the conclusion that further measures and regulatory updates, including adjustments to the PSD, are required. In the Commission’s 2012 Communication “Single Market Act II – Together for new growth”, the modernisation of the legislative framework for retail payments has been identified as a key priority in view of its potential for new growth and innovation. The revision of the PSD and the preparation of a legislative proposal on multilateral interchange fees for card payments were defined as one of the key actions of the Commission for 2013. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that the best policy options to improve the existing situation by (i) reinforcing the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project; (ii) facilitating standardisation through adequate governance framework; (iii) ensuring legal certainty in the field of interchange fees for card-based payments; (iv) abolishing restrictive business rules for card payments; (v) defining conditions of access to the information on the availability of funds for third party providers; (vi) adjusting the scope and improve the consistency of the legislative framework; (vii) reinforcing the rights of payment services users and safeguard the consumer rights in view of the regulatory changes. CONTENT: this proposal also incorporates and repeals Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Payment Services Directive which sets the basis for a harmonised legal framework for the creation of an integrated payments market. It aims to update and complement the current framework on payments services by providing for rules that enhance transparency, innovation and security in the field of retail payments and improving consistency between national rules, with an emphasis on the legitimate needs of consumers. More specifically, the proposed measures seek to: ensure a competitive level playing field between all categories of payment service providers, including new emerging providers, which in turn increases the choice, efficiency, transparency and security of retail payments; facilitate the provision of innovative card, internet and mobile payment services across borders by ensuring a Single Market for all retail payments; address standardisation and interoperability gaps for card, internet and mobile payments; eliminate hurdles for competition , in particular for card and internet payments; align charging and steering practices for payment services across the EU; ensure that emerging types of payment services and instruments are covered by the regulatory framework for retail payments in the EU; ensure a consistent application of the legislative framework (PSD) and align the practical operation of the licensing and supervisory rules for payment services across Member States; ensure adequate and consistent protection of consumer interests in the context of payment transactions, including extending regulatory protection to new channels and innovative payment services. The proposed measures seek to implement this reform in a technologically neutral manner that will remain relevant as payment services evolve further. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the impact on the EU budget is estimated at EUR 609 000 for the period 2015-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains measures empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
1081EP7,"""""Financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries""""",0.719,0.828,0.842,0.516,0.242,0.843,0.81,0.543,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation 1934/2009/EC establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised (ICI) with a view to extending its geographical scope to the DCI countries. BACKGROUND: since 2007 the Community has streamlined its geographical cooperation with developing countries in Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America and with Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and South Africa under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI). The scope of cooperation for the geographic programmes with developing countries, territories and regions established under the Regulation is furthermore limited materially to financing measures to eradicate poverty through the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is in the Community’s interests to further deepen its relations with the developing countries concerned, which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral for a (e.g. Brazil, India or China). It therefore needs a financial instrument that allows the financing of such measures which, by their nature, do not qualify as Official Development Assistance. For that purpose, four Preparatory Actions were set up in the 2007 and 2008 budget procedures to initiate enhanced cooperation in business and scientific exchanges with countries in Asia and Latin America. It is however necessary to provide a legal basis for this specific type of cooperation in order to formalise these exchanges with high-income group countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers 4 policy options: 1) No EU action: cooperation with the countries concerned remains strictly in the framework of the DCI regulation; 2) amend DCI Regulation: add an additional strand to the regulation to finance ‘non-ODA activities’ with a ring-fenced amount; 3) amend ICI Regulation: extend the geographical scope of the regulation to DCI countries with a ring-fenced amount; 4) table a new instrument. The different options have been analyzed on the criteria of coherence, efficiency and effectiveness. Option 1 is not considered a valid option in view of the need to fill the legislative gap. Option 2 would be the most coherent, but it is not recommended as it would bring different objectives under the same regulation: eradicating poverty and fostering Community interests. In conclusion, Option 3 is considered the most appropriate and effective legislative option in view of the major simplification of the financial instruments. CONTENT: the proposal thus intends to extend the geographical scope of the countries covered by the DCI Regulation which was initially set up for industrialised and high-income countries. The primary objective of cooperation shall be to provide a specific response to the need to strengthen links and to engage further with them on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis in order to create a more favourable environment for the development of the relations of the Community with these countries and territories and promote dialogue while fostering Community's interests. It shall be aimed at engaging with partners which share similar political, economic and institutional structures and values to the Community and which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral fora and in global governance. Two annexes have therefore been included in the Regulation: Annex I (existing) covering industrialised and other high-income countries and territories ; Annex II (new) covering DCI developing countries (46 countries). Furthermore, in duly justified circumstances and in order to foster regional cooperation, the Commission may decide when adopting action programmes that countries not listed in the Annexes are eligible, where the project or programme to be implemented is of regional or cross-border nature. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: additional appropriations are requested for this new type of cooperation – corresponding to the continuation of the 2007 to 2008 preparatory actions. As a result, although the financial envelope amounts to EUR 176 million, the budgetary impact is EUR 67.5 million from 2010 to 2013 to cover activities relating to the follow-up of these actions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the rapid take up of online content services and increasing use of portable devices, including across borders, means that Europeans today expect to use online content services from wherever they are in the Union (cross-border portability). However, when people travel in the EU, they frequently cannot enjoy such cross-border portability or can do so only to a limited extent. The absence of, or problems with, cross border portability of online content services in the EU results from the licensing practices of right holders and/or the commercial practices of service providers. Cross-border portability concerns online content services to which consumers have lawful access, or content that they purchased or rented online in their country of residence and to which they want to continue to have access when travelling in the EU. Consumer demand for the cross-border portability of online content services is substantial and expected to grow The Digital Single Market Strategy puts forward a range of initiatives with the objective of creating an internal market for digital content and services. This proposal is among the first of the initiatives under the strategy. The Commission considers that the proposal will have positive effects on competitiveness as it will help innovation in online content services and attract more consumers to them. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option, in addition to establishing a mechanism ensuring portability: (i) would impose an obligation on providers of online content services to ensure cross-border portability of such services and (ii) would establish that any provisions in contracts limiting cross-border portability would be unenforceable. This option would respond to consumers' expectations and the impact on industry is expected to be marginal because the portability of online content services does not extend the range of users of the service and as such does not challenge the territorial exclusivity of licences CONTENT: the proposed regulation introduces a common approach to ensuring that subscribers to online content services in the Union, which are delivered on a portable basis, can receive these services when temporarily present in another Member State (cross-border portability). Definitions : the proposal contains definitions that will need to be interpreted in a uniform manner in the EU: a ""subscriber"" is defined as a consumer who, on the basis of a contract for the provision of an online content service, may access and use such service in the Member State of his or her residence; a ""consumer"" is defined as any natural person who, in contracts covered by the regulation, is acting for purposes which are outside his or her trade, business, craft or profession. ""Online content service"" is covered by the proposal when: (i) the service is lawfully provided online in the Member State of residence; (ii) the service is provided on a portable basis; (iii) the service is an audiovisual media service within the meaning of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council or a service whose main feature is the provision of access to works, other subject matter or transmissions of broadcasting organisations. Two scenarios are covered as regards online content services: (i) services which are provided for payment of money (directly or indirectly); and (ii) services which are provided without payment of money provided that the subscriber's Member State of residence is verified by the service provider. if a subscriber receives an online content service without payment of money, the provider will only be obliged to enable the subscriber to enjoy cross-border portability if the provider verifies the subscriber's Member State of residence; if, however, a consumer just accepts the terms and conditions of a free of charge online content service but does not register on a website of such service (and hence the provider does not verify the Member State of residence of such a consumer), the service provider will not be obliged to provide cross-border portability for such service. Cross-border portability of online content services : the proposal requires the provider to enable a subscriber to use the online content service while the subscriber is temporarily present in another Member State. This applies to the same content, on the same range and number of devices and the same range of functionalities as offered in the Member State of residence. However, this obligation does not extend to any quality requirements applicable to the delivery of such service when the service is provided in the Member State of residence. Nevertheless, if the provider expressly agrees to guarantee certain quality of delivery to subscribers while temporarily present in other Member States, the provider shall be bound by such agreement. In addition, the draft regulation will oblige the provider to inform the subscriber of the quality of delivery of the online content service when accessed and used in a Member State other than the Member State of residence. Localisation: the proposal sets out a mechanism establishing the localisation of the service for purposes of portability: the provision as well as the access to and use of the service by a subscriber who is temporarily present in another Member State is deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. For the licensing of copyright and related rights, this means that the relevant copyright acts, which occur when the service is provided to consumers on a basis of crossborder portability, are deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. Contractual provisions : the proposal renders unenforceable: any contractual terms contrary to the cross-border portability obligation, in particular those which limit either consumer's possibilities as to the cross-border portability of his or her online content services or service provider's ability to deliver it; any contractual terms contrary to the legal mechanism which enables service providers to comply with the cross-border portability obligation. However, right holders may require that the service provider makes use of means in order to verify that the service is provided in conformity with the regulation. The draft regulation also provides that: (i) the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the Regulation shall be carried out in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2002/58/EC; (ii) the regulation shall also apply to any contracts concluded and rights acquired before the date of the application of the regulation if they are relevant for the provision of the service, the access to or the use of the service."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is committed to protect and improve human health, in particular to combat the major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed shortcomings in the EU’s mechanisms for managing health threats. The proposal builds on lessons learnt during the COVID-19 crisis, and proposes to strengthen the existing Union level structures and mechanisms for improved levels of protection, prevention, preparedness and response, against all health hazards across the EU. The proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to reinforce the crisis preparedness and response and enhance the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Together, they form part of the EU’s overall health response to COVID-19 as well as an improved crisis management framework. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the Centre’s founding regulation in order to reinforce its mandate so that it may support the Commission and Member States in the following areas: epidemiological surveillance via integrated systems enabling real-time surveillance preparedness and response planning, reporting and auditing situational awareness: rapid digitalisation of integrated surveillance systems; better preparedness in Member States: develop prevention and response plans against future epidemics and stronger capacities for integrated rapid epidemic and outbreak response; reinforced measures to control epidemics and outbreaks: provision of nonbinding recommendations for risk management; reinforced capacity and to identify population groups at risk and in need of targeted prevention and response measures; building up the key competences for health protection in Member States: the Centre will be tasked with coordinating a new network of Union reference laboratories for public health and a new network of national services supporting transfusion, transplantation and medically assisted reproduction; expanding work on the prevention of communicable diseases and specific health issues, e.g., antimicrobial resistance, vaccination and biosecurity; reinforcing the contribution to the EU’s international cooperation and development and EU commitment to global health security preparedness. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications should relate mainly to: setting-up a new vaccine monitoring platform hosted jointly by the European Medicines Agency and the Centre; new networks on Union reference laboratories and on transfusion, transplantation and medically assisted reproduction; reinforcing surveillance systems and the Early Warning and Response System; monitoring and assessing health systems capacity and identifying population groups at risk and in need of targeted prevention and response measures; creating a ‘EU Health Task Force’ to support countries with preparedness strengthening and quickly intervene in a health crisis; improving international collaboration and gathering of regional/national intelligence."
7938EP8,"""""Unfair trading practices in business-to-business relationships in the food supply chain""""",0.571,0.638,0.1,0.792,0.154,0.597,0.733,0.308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish in all Member States a minimum standard of protection against unfair commercial practices in the food supply chain. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: smaller operators in the food supply chain are more prone to face unfair trading practices (UTPs) due to their, in general, weak bargaining power in comparison to the large operators in the chain. According to a 2013 survey of agricultural producers and agricultural cooperatives based on a wide definition of UTPs, the estimated damage from UTPs amounted to over EUR 10 billion per year. In an agricultural policy environment that has become distinctly more market oriented, the good governance of the food supply chain has become more important for operators, in particular for agricultural producers. The divergence of Member States’ regulatory approaches to UTPs results furthermore in dissimilar conditions of competition for operators. In June 2016, a European Parliament resolution called on the Commission to submit a proposal for a Union legal framework concerning unfair trading practices. In December 2016, the Council invited the Commission to undertake, in a timely manner, an impact assessment with a view to proposing a Union legal framework or non-legislative measures to address unfair trading practices. The proposed measures are complementary to measures existing in Member States and the code of conduct of the SCI (minimum harmonisation approach). The voluntary Supply Chain Initiative (SCI) is a private industry initiative that seeks to govern UTPs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is partial harmonisation of UTP rules in the EU food supply chain while introducing a common minimum protection standard in the EU to help achieve the objective of reducing the occurrence of UTPs. Concretely formulated prohibitions targeting specific UTPs will also reduce legal uncertainty for commercial transactions that may derive from a more general prohibition. CONTENT: the present proposal for a Directive aims at reducing the occurrence of UTPs in the food supply chain by introducing a minimum common standard of protection across the EU that consists of a short list of specific prohibited UTPs. The protection applies only to SME suppliers in the food supply chain as regards their sales to buyers which are not SMEs. Prohibition of unfair trading practices : Member States shall ensure that the following trading practices are prohibited: a buyer pays a supplier for perishable food products later than 30 calendar days after the receipt of the supplier’s invoice or later than 30 calendar days after the date of delivery of the perishable food products, whichever is the later; a buyer cancels orders of perishable food products at such short notice that a supplier cannot reasonably be expected to find an alternative to commercialise or use these products; a buyer unilaterally and retroactively changes the terms of the supply agreement concerning the frequency, timing or volume of the supply or delivery, the quality standards or the prices of the food products; a supplier pays for the wastage of food products that occurs on the buyer's premises and that is not caused by the negligence or fault of the supplier. Member States shall ensure that the following trading practices are prohibited, if they are not agreed in clear and unambiguous terms at the conclusion of the supply agreement: a buyer returns unsold food products to a supplier; a buyer charges a supplier payment as a condition for the stocking, displaying or listing food products of the supplier; a supplier pays for the promotion of food products sold by the buyer. Designated enforcement authority : the proposal provides that Member States will have to designate a public authority to enforce the new rules. Enforcement authorities are vested with the necessary powers to start an investigation on their own initiative or based on a complaint, to gather information, terminate an infringement and to impose fines and publish the decisions taken to achieve a deterrent effect. They shall be able to deal with confidential complaints and to protect, where requested, the identity of the complainant. Coordination and cooperation between enforcement authorities is foreseen. This covers annual meetings facilitated by the Commission and annual reports that the enforcement authorities will submit. The proposal clarifies that Member States may provide for additional rules designed to combat UTPs going above and beyond this minimum Union standard as long as those rules respect the rules pertaining to the internal market. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal would have a limited impact on the EU budget. It would entail one annual coordination meeting of Member States’ enforcement authorities in Brussels and the creation and management of a basic website for the information exchange by the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a shift from the use of fossil fuels in vehicles to electromobility is one of the prerequisites for reaching the climate neutrality goal in 2050. Batteries are thus an important source of energy and one of the key enablers for sustainable development, green mobility, clean energy and climate neutrality. The current regulatory framework, with Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries, only covers the end-of-life stage of batteries. There are currently no legal provisions in the EU that cover other aspects of the production and use phases of batteries, such as electrochemical performance and durability, GHG emissions, or responsible sourcing. According to estimates from the World Economic Forum, there is a need to scale up global battery production by a factor of 19 to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Commission is therefore proposing to modernise EU legislation on batteries, implementing its first initiative among the measures announced in the new action plan for the circular economy. In addition to the Commission’s work, both the Council and the Parliament have called for action to support the transition to electro-mobility, carbon-neutral energy storage, and a sustainable battery value chain. CONTENT: this proposal introduces gradual requirements to minimise the carbon footprint throughout the life cycle of batteries. Its objective is three-fold: 1) to strengthen the functioning of the internal market (including products, processes, battery waste and recycled materials) by ensuring a level playing field through a common set of rules; 2) to promote a circular economy; and 3) reduce environmental and social impacts throughout all the stages of the battery life cycle Minimum sustainability requirements In order to encourage the production and placing on the EU market of high quality and efficient batteries, the proposed Regulation establishes requirements on sustainability, safety and labelling to allow the placing on the market and putting into service of batteries, as well as requirements for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries. The Regulation would apply to all types of batteries, i.e. portable batteries, automotive batteries, electric vehicle batteries and industrial batteries. The proposal also sets out requirements to ensure the proper functioning of the market for secondary raw materials while preventing and reducing the environmental impacts of the production and use of batteries, as well as their treatment (including recycling) at the end of the battery's life. Carbon footprint of electric vehicle batteries and rechargeable industrial batteries The proposal provides for the following: - as of 1 July 2024, only industrial rechargeable batteries and electric vehicle batteries for which a carbon footprint statement has been drawn up could be placed on the market; - as of 1 January 2026, batteries should be classified into carbon footprint performance classes; - as of 1 July 2027, batteries should comply with maximum life-cycle carbon footprint thresholds; - as of 1 January 2030, industrial and electric-vehicle batteries with internal storage should contain the following minimum share of recovered cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel from waste of the cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel present in active materials in those batteries: 12% cobalt; 85% lead, 4% lithium and 4% nickel; - as of 1 January 2035, the minimum share of recovered cobalt, lithium or nickel should increase to 20% cobalt, 10% lithium and 12% nickel. For lead the minimum share shall stay at 85%. Increasing the resilience of the EU battery supply chain by closing the materials loop To close the loop and keep recovered materials used in batteries in the European economy for as long as possible, the Commission proposes to set new requirements and targets for the recycled content and the collection, treatment and recycling of batteries at the end of their life cycle. The proposal sets collection rates for waste portable batteries to be achieved by Member States, excluding currently waste batteries from light means of transport. The collection rates should gradually increase so to ensure that by end 2025 65% of waste portable batteries are collected and by end 2030 70% of such batteries are collected. The proposal also contains requirements for re-purposing and remanufacturing operations to give a second life to industrial and electric vehicle batteries. Persons carrying out the repurposing or remanufacturing of batteries should ensure that the examination, performance testing, packing and shipment of batteries and their components is carried out following adequate quality control and safety instructions. Battery passports By 1 January 2026 at the latest, a ‘passport’ should be created for batteries, with a view to enabling economic operators to collect and re-use information and data on each battery placed on the market more efficiently and to make better informed choices in their planning activities.

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the draft Council decision. The Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the North Pacific Ocean was signed on 24 February 2012 and entered into force on 19 July 2015. Its aim is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the Convention Area while protecting the North Pacific marine ecosystems in which those resources occur. By acceding to the Convention, the Union intends to give the Member States and Union vessels concerned access to the fishery resources in the Convention area. Accession to the North Pacific Ocean Convention creates new opportunities for EU vessels. It would promote consistency in the EU's approach to conservation across the world’s oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources globally. With a view to reaching its objectives, the Convention provides for the following actions to be taken: - promoting the optimum utilization and ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources; - adopting measures, based on the best scientific information available, to ensure that fisheries resources are maintained at or restored to levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield; - adopting and implementing measures in accordance with the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries, and in accordance with the relevant rules of international law; - assessing the impacts of fishing activities on species belonging to the same ecosystem or dependent upon or associated with the target stocks and adopting, where necessary, conservation and management measures for such species; - protecting biodiversity in the marine environment; - preventing or eliminating overfishing and excess fishing capacity; - ensuring that complete and accurate data concerning fishing activities are collected and shared in a timely and appropriate manner; - ensuring that any expansion of fishing effort, development of new or exploratory fisheries, or change in the gear used for existing fisheries, does not proceed without prior assessment of the impacts of those fishing activities on the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources; - ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures and that sanctions applicable in respect of violations are adequate in severity to be effective in securing compliance, to discourage violations wherever they occur and to deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities; - minimising pollution and waste originating from fishing vessels, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, and impacts on other species and marine ecosystems."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates - a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges - are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."

6622EP7,"""""Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS V)""""",0.825,0.853,0.965,0.548,0.333,0.867,0.882,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve investors' confidence in undertakings of collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since the UCITS Directive was adopted in 1985, the rules relating to depositaries in the Directive have remained unchanged. These rules consist of a number of generic principles setting out the duties of depositaries. The Directive makes reference to national laws in respect of the precise contours of these duties. This leaves considerable scope for diverging interpretations regarding the scope of a depositary's duties and the liability for the negligent performance thereof. As a result, different approaches have developed across the European Union, leading to UCITS investors facing uneven levels of protection in different jurisdictions. The potential consequences of national divergences in the liability standard came to the fore following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the Madoff fraud. The Madoff case raised several important issues in relation to UCITS funds particularly regarding the precise conditions under which a depositary acting on behalf of a UCITS fund can delegate safekeeping of assets to a sub-custodian. The Madoff case also raises the issue of conflicts of interest. The Commission considers it necessary to amend Directive 2009/65/EC in order to take into account market developments and the experiences of market participants and supervisors gathered so far, in particular to address discrepancies between national provisions in respect of depositaries' duties and liability, remuneration policy and sanctions. This proposal forms part of a wider legislative package dedicated to rebuilding consumer trust in financial markets. The package has two other parts: ·  the first is an extensive overhaul of the Insurance Mediation Directive 2002/92/EC to ensure a high level of protection when buying insurance products; ·  the second part isa proposal for a regulation on key information documents on investment products, aiming at improving transparency in the investment market for retail investors. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on five issues. Its main conclusions are as follows: 1.  Eligibility to act as a depositary : both credit institutions and regulated investment firms provide sufficient guarantees in terms of prudential regulation, capital requirements and effective supervision to act as UCITS depositaries. Other institutions (such as law firms, notaries) are not deemed to provide these guarantees and would have, if they wished to act as UCITS depositaries, to transform themselves into regulated investment firms. As most UCITS depositaries are already credit institutions or regulated investment firms, the impact of the chosen option would thus only concern a small minority of unlicensed service providers. 2.  Delegation of custody: the delegation of custody should be governed by rules on diligence in selecting an appointing a sub-custodian, and on the ongoing monitoring of the activities of the sub-custodian. 3.  Liability: a 'strict liability' standard obliging depositaries to return instruments lost in custody irrespective of fault or negligence is both conducive to ensuring a high level of investor protection and to achieving a uniform standard across the EU. 4.  Remuneration: the proposal envisages introducing a requirement for the UCITS management company to implement remuneration policy that is consistent with sound risk management of the UCITS fund and complies with minimum remuneration principles. 5.  Sanctions: the policy choice is to achieve minimum harmonisation of the sanctions regime. This regime would apply to a catalogue of breaches of main investor protection safeguards in the UCITS Directive. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Directive 2009/65/EC on UCITS as regards depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. The main points of the proposal are as follows: Rules on depositaries’ duties : in relation to the depositary's core safekeeping and oversight duties, the draft proposes to amend the UCITS Directive in the following manner: ·  appointment of a single depositary for each UCITS fund in order to ensure that one fund cannot have several depositaries. The appointment of a depositary shall be evidenced by written contract; ·  making uniform a list of oversight duties of depositaries of UCITS established in a contractual form and UCITS established in a corporate form. These duties involve: (i) verifying compliance with applicable rules when UCITS shares are sold, issued, re-purchased, redeemed and cancelled; (ii) verifying that any consideration is remitted to it within the usual time limits; (iii) verifying that the investment company's income is applied in accordance with its instruments of incorporation, ensuring that the value of units in a UCITS is calculated in accordance with the applicable national law and the fund rules; (iv) and carrying out instructions of the management or investment company; ·  detailed provisions on cash monitoring in order to equip the depositary with a view over all the assets of the UCITS, cash included. The proposal also ensures that no cash account associated with the funds' transactions shall be opened without the depositary's knowledge. The aim is to avoid the possibility of fraudulent cash transfers. This paragraph also introduces a segregation requirement, so that any financial instruments on the depositary's book held for a UCITS can be distinguished from the depositary's own assets and can at all times be identified as belonging to that UCITS; ·  introduction of a distinction between (a) custodial duties relating to financial instruments that can be held in custody by the depositary and (b) verification of the ownership duties relating to the remaining types of assets; ·  introduction of a series of customary provisions on professional conduct, the avoidance of and the management of conflicts of interest. Rules on delegation: ·  the proposal defines the conditions in which the depositary’s safekeeping duties can be delegated to a sub-custodian (the conditions upon which a UCITS depositary may entrust its safekeeping duties to a third party are aligned with those applicable under the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive). Rules on eligibility to act as a UCITS custodian: ·  introduction of an exhaustive list of entities that are eligible to act as depositaries. The policy choice is to only allow credit institutions and investment firms to act as UCITS depositaries. Rules on liability: ·  clarification of the UCITS depositary's liability in case of the loss of a financial instrument that is held in custody. Where a financial instrument held in custody is lost, the UCITS depositary shall be under the obligation to return a financial instrument of the identical type or of the corresponding amount to the UCITS. No further discharge of liability in case of loss of assets is envisaged, except where the depositary can prove that the loss is due to an 'external event beyond its reasonable control'; ·  the depositary's liability is not affected by the fact that it has entrusted to a third party all or some of its custody tasks. As a result, the depositary is obliged to return instruments held in custody that are lost, even if the loss was incurred by the sub-custodian. Redress: ·  alignment of the rights of investors in both corporate and contractual UCITS so that they are able to invoke claims relating to the liabilities of depositaries, either directly or indirectly (through the management company), depending on the legal nature of the relationship between the depositary, the management company and the unit-holders. Remuneration: ·  the proposal reflects current policy on remuneration of senior management, risk takers and those who exercise control functions. These principles should also apply to those that manage a UCITS fund, be it managed in the form of an investment company or in the form of a management company. Access to telephone and data records: ·  competent authorities will be able to require existing telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunication operator or by a UCITS, a management company, an investment company or a depositary, where a reasonable suspicion exists that such records related to the subject-matter of the inspection may be relevant to prove a breach of the provisions of the UCITS Directive. Sanctions and measures: ·  a common approach to the main breaches of the UCITS Directive. The proposal sets out a list of the main breaches. It also lays down the administrative sanctions and measures that the competent authorities should be empowered to apply in case of the main breaches. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: this Council draft is part of the Union preparedness and contingency plan to mitigate the most significant disruptions of a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement. The United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom are participating in a number of Union programmes or actions on the basis of the United Kingdom’s membership in the Union. The participation takes place on the basis of agreements with the United Kingdom or persons or entities established in the United Kingdom or decisions in favour of the United Kingdom or persons or entities established in the United Kingdom which constitute legal commitments. In case of a withdrawal without a withdrawal agreement, it would be beneficial both for the Union and its Member States and for the United Kingdom, and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom, to provide for the eligibility in 2020 of the United Kingdom and beneficiaries established in the United Kingdom to receive Union funds and for the participation of the United Kingdom in the financing of the budget for 2020. It would also be beneficial if the legal commitments signed and adopted before the date of withdrawal, or in 2019 in application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197, could continue to be executed throughout 2020. CONTENT: the draft Council defines the conditions under which the United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom may continue to be eligible in 2020 with regard to agreements signed with them and decisions adopted with regard to them until the date of withdrawal or, where applicable, in 2019 pursuant to the contingency Regulation (Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197). The application of the proposed Regulation is subject to the following conditions: - the United Kingdom has confirmed the commitment in writing to the Commission to continue to pay a contribution calculated on the basis of the estimated own resources from the United Kingdom as set out in the draft budget for 2020 and adjusted to take into account the total amount of payment appropriations set out in the adopted budget for 2020; - a first instalment has been paid by the United Kingdom; - the United Kingdom has confirmed the commitment in writing to the Commission to allow audits and controls in full by the Union in compliance with the applicable rules. As long as the conditions for eligibility of the United Kingdom, and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom continue to be fulfilled, their eligibility should be ensured in 2020 for the purposes of conditions set in calls, tenders, contests or any other procedure which may lead to financing from the Union’s budget, with the exception of specific cases relating to security and the loss of the United Kingdom’s status as a member of the European Investment Bank, and to provide Union funding to them. Such Union funding should be limited to eligible expenditure incurred in 2020, except for public procurement contracts signed before the end of 2020 in application of Title VII of the Financial Regulation, which continue to be implemented in accordance with their terms, and except for the United Kingdom agricultural direct payment scheme for the claim year 2020, which should be excluded from eligibility. The draft regulation also provides for: - the continued eligibility of the United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom provided that the United Kingdom continues to pay the contribution for 2020 and, where applicable, for 2019 under Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197 and that controls and audits can be carried out effectively; - the continuation, in 2020, of the eligibility of actions under which Member States or persons or entities established in Member States receive funds from the Union and which are related to the United Kingdom. As it lays down measures for the implementation and financing of the Union's budget for 2020, the proposed Regulation should only concern eligibility for the 2020 financial year."
2157EP7,"""""Surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies""""",0.246,0.879,0.123,0.129,0.061,0.88,0.072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: the reform of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact with a view to strengthening the EU’s economic governance. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the global economic and financial crisis revealed gaps and weaknesses in the existing instruments and methods of co-ordination and surveillance of economic policies in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). There is broad agreement that the framework for EMU should be urgently strengthened in order to anchor macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances. The key instrument for fiscal policy co-ordination and surveillance is the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which implements the Treaty provisions on budgetary discipline. Strengthening the Pact is important for both increasing the credibility of the agreed co-ordinated fiscal exit strategy and avoiding a repetition of past mistakes. This proposal is part of legislative package comprising six texts which seeks to strengthen the pact by improving its provisions in the light of experience, not least of the crisis: 1) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1466/97); 2) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1467/97); 3) A Regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area; 4) A new Council Directive on requirements for the budgetary framework of the Member States; 5) A new Regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; 6) A Regulation on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. The outlines of these proposals were announced by the Commission in two communications on economic governance: “Reinforcing economic policy coordination” (12 May 2010) and “Enhancing economic policy coordination for stability, growth and jobs – Tools for stronger EU economic governance” (30 June 2010). In June 2010, the European Council agreed on the urgent need to reinforce the coordination of economic policies. strengthening both the preventive and corrective parts of the SGP, including with sanctions and taking due account of the particular situation of euro-area Member States; giving, in budgetary surveillance, a much more prominent role to levels and evolutions of debt and overall sustainability; ensuring that all Member States have national budgetary rules and medium term budgetary frameworks in line with the SGP; ensuring the quality of statistical data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the preventive part of the SGP is meant to ensure that Member States follow prudent fiscal policies so that there is no need to adopt more stringent forms of coordination to avoid public finance sustainability being put at risk, with potential negative consequences for EMU as a whole. Accordingly, Member States are required to present stability and convergence programmes outlining their plans to achieve medium-term budgetary objectives (MTOs), which are defined as a percentage of GDP in structural terms (i.e. adjusting for the effect of the cycle and excluding one-off and temporary measures) and are differentiated across countries around a close-to-balance position to reflect the level of public debt and liabilities related to ageing. Member States not having reached their MTO are expected to converge towards it at an annual pace of 0.5% of GDP in structural terms. However, progress towards MTOs in the medium term has been generally insufficient. In a number of countries, even apparently sound budgetary positions before the crisis masked a strong reliance on windfall revenues to finance expenditure, the reversal of which contributed to soaring budget deficits. To respond to these shortcomings the reform of the preventive part that is being proposed, while retaining the current MTOs and the 0.5% of GDP annual convergence requirement, makes them operational in terms of a new principle of prudent fiscal policy-making. This new principle will provide the benchmark against which countries’ fiscal plans in the stability and convergence programme will be examined. A prudent fiscal policy implies that the rate of growth of public expenditure does not exceed, in principle, a prudent medium-term rate of growth of GDP, unless the MTO has been significantly overachieved or the excess of expenditure growth over the prudent medium-term rate is matched by discretionary measures on the revenue side. Failure to keep to the agreed rate of growth of expenditure, in conjunction with the stipulated revenue measures, will make the Member State concerned liable to a warning from the Commission and, if persistent and/or particularly serious, a Council recommendation to take corrective action. A temporary departure from prudent fiscal policy-making should be allowed in case of severe economic downturn of a general nature in order to facilitate economic recovery. Special attention shall be paid to pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully funded pillar. Member States implementing such reforms shall be allowed to deviate from the adjustment path to their medium-term budgetary objective or from the objective itself, with the deviation reflecting the net cost of the reform to the publicly managed pillar, under the condition that the deviation remains temporary and that an appropriate safety margin with respect to the deficit reference value is preserved. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal relates to the extension of an existing action and does not require any additional human or financial resources."
569EP8,"""""Pre-financing of operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative""""",0.829,0.932,0.94,0.458,0.135,0.925,0.953,0.923,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to increase the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in light of the persistent high levels of youth unemployment in the Union, a Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) was established to provide support to 7 million young Europeans not in employment, education or training in the most affected regions. The YEI is integrated in the programming of the European Social Fund (ESF). To ensure a quick response to fighting youth unemployment, Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down general provisions on the five European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) and Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the European Social Funds lay down provisions to allow for a quicker mobilisation of the resources allocated to the YEI, including, inter alia, the commitment of all the resources in the first two years of the programming period. Operations under the YEI therefore have to be implemented, in principle, by the end of 2018 and not 2023 as it is the case for other operations supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), including the European Social Fund. The budgetary constraints faced by Member states and the lack of available funding at the initial stage of the programming period have caused significant delays in the implementation of the YEI. In its Work Programme for 2015, the Commission committed to take initiatives to promote integration and employability in the labour market, including measures to support Member States in getting young people into work. Taking into account the urgent need to address youth unemployment, the Commission states that it is necessary to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to operational programmes supported by the YEI in 2015. CONTENT: it is proposed to introduce an additional provision in Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the additional initial pre-financing for operational programmes supported by the YEI. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to increase the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) from 1-1.5% as outlined in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to a maximum of 30% of the envelope which is allocated to it for 2015. To ensure that the additional initial pre-financing amount is used for the immediate implementation of the YEI, the proposal foresees that this amount is reimbursed to the Commission, if the Union contribution from the YEI does not amount to an adequate level in interim payment applications submitted to the Commission 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the YEI remains unchanged. The increased need for payment appropriations for the YEI additional initial pre-financing in 2015 will be fully covered by appropriations of the 2015 budget for the YEI specific allocation. Consequently, the proposed modification should not trigger a potential backlog of 2014-2020 unpaid claims."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on the European statistical programme 2013-2017 provides the framework and defines the objectives and outputs for the production, development and dissemination of European statistics for the period from 2013 to 2017. In its resolution of 13 June 2012 on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and own resources, the European Parliament stressed that the negotiations on the legislative proposals relating to the multiannual programmes would be finalised once an agreement on their financial envelopes had been reached. This is why Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 only sets the financial envelope for 2013, covered by the programming period 2007-2013, and invites the Commission to make a legislative proposal introducing the financial allocation for the period 2014-2017 to the European Parliament and the Council no later than three months after the adoption of the MFF for the years 2014-2020. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment was conducted for the proposal for a Regulation on the European statistical programme 2013-17, which included the budget for 2014-2017. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 determines the financial allocation for the four years covered by the European statistical programme 2013-2017 that fall under the programming period 2014 to 2020 of the MFF. the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2013 is set at EUR 57.3 million, covered by the programming period 2007 to 2013; the Union financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2014 to 2017 is set at EUR 234.8 million, covered by the programming period 2014 to 2020. The other provisions of the Regulation on the European Statistical programme 2013-2017 remain unchanged, in particular in regard to the objectives pursued and the annex, which defines statistical outputs for the five years covered. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: since the specific objectives and statistical outputs for the five-year period are set in the Regulation, the amount of budget proposed for the period from 2014 to 2017 is EUR 234.8 million, covered by the programming period 2014-2020."

The Parties to the Agreement are the EU, US, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and Macao (China). The arrangement originally covered over six thousand products. However, given that new pharmaceutical products are constantly being developed, the arrangement envisages periodic reviews. The Parties agreed to ""meet under the auspices of the Council for Trade in Goods of the WTO, normally at least once every three years, to review the product coverage with a view to including, by consensus, additional pharmaceutical products for tariff elimination."" The coverage was first reviewed in 1995-1996 and as a result an extra 465 products received duty free treatment. The second review in 1998 (implemented in July 1999) resulted in an extra 639 products receiving duty free treatment. The third review in 2006 resulted in the addition of 1290 products. A fourth review of the products covered by the Record was launched in 2009, in accordance with Article 3 of the Record, which requires Participants to review at least once every three years the product coverage with a view to including additional pharmaceutical products for tariff elimination. The EU participated in these technical discussions. In the course of these discussions, Participants concluded that additional INNs and pharmaceutical intermediates used for production and manufacture of finished pharmaceuticals should be granted duty-free treatment and that the list of specified prefixes and suffixes for salts, esters or hydrates of INNs should be expanded, thereby adding 718 new substances to the list of products eligible for duty-free treatment.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to making available on the market of measuring instruments is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2004/22/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The proposal does not change the scope of Directive 2004/22/EC and the essential requirements. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the instruments are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the article bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2004/22/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2004/22/EC on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their instruments comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant instrument is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
1607EP7,"""""Granting and withdrawing international protection""""",0.0,0.037,0.737,0.065,0.152,0.819,0.892,0.371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to recast Council Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: work on the creation of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) started in May 1999, on the basis of the principles approved by the Tampere European Council. During the first phase of the CEAS (1999-2005), the goal was to harmonise Member States' legal frameworks on the basis of minimum standards. Directive 2005/85/EC was the last of the five pieces of EU asylum legislation. It aims to establish minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status. This proposal falls within the Policy Plan on Asylum which provides for the second phase of the CEAS. It aims to address the deficiencies in procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection and to ensure higher and more harmonised standards of protection, thus progressing towards a common asylum procedure and a uniform status. The amendment that have been proposed are drawn from the responses received to the Commission’s consultation on the Green Paper on the future of the Common European Asylum System which highlighted the proliferation of disparate procedural arrangements at national level and deficiencies regarding the level of procedural guarantees for asylum applicants, which are likely to give rise to gaps in protection and the risk of refoulement. Given that this lack of uniformity is a source of uncertainty for asylum seekers and blocks the advent of a truly common asylum system, the Commission has proposed the recasting of the 2005 text. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment mainly focused on the points that appeared the most controversial, as well as those that will require additional financial resources. At the end of the analysis, a number of options emerged to strengthen and harmonise EU asylum procedures. The preferred option provides for the establishment of harmonised procedural guarantees, notions and principles essential in Community law. In harmonising procedural arrangements, the preferred option is likely to guarantee access under equivalent conditions throughout the Union and a more equitable sharing of the ‘burden’ between the Member States. It is also an important step in the process of a single asylum procedure, the principle of non-refoulement and, more generally, respect for fundamental rights. CONTENT: the envisaged measures are expected to improve the coherence between EU asylum instruments, simplify, streamline and consolidate procedural arrangements across the Union and lead to more robust determinations at first instance, thus preventing abuse and improving efficiency of the asylum process. Main objective of the recasting of the directive: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure higher and more coherent standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection. It also aims at improving both the efficiency and the quality of decision making by “frontloading"" services, advice and expertise and encouraging Member States to deliver, within a reasonable time, robust determinations at first instance. The improved efficiency and quality of the asylum process should: (a) enable MS to quicker distinguish between asylum seekers and other migrants in mixed arrivals, thus optimising labour and administrative resources needed to establish and complete applicable procedures (return, asylum, humanitarian status, extradition etc.); (b) allow the asylum authorities to take robust decisions, based on complete and properly established factual circumstances of the claim, improve the defendability of negative decisions and reduce risk of their annulment by appeal bodies; (c) enable the asylum personnel to better identify cases of unfounded and abusive applications, including those based on false identity or nationality; (d) reduce Member States' reception costs and support their efforts to remove failed asylum seekers from the territory since quality determinations will be delivered quicker and more cases will result in a final decision already in the first instance. Genuine refugees and persons in need of subsidiary protection would enjoy quicker access to entitlements set out in the Qualification Directive. Lastly, the proposal aims at simplifying and consolidating procedural notions and devices and improving consistency between asylum instruments. This should, among other things, limit the phenomenon of secondary movements of asylum seekers amongst Member States, to the degree that such movements are generated from divergent procedural arrangements. The main amendments proposed are as follows: (a) measures to ensure the consistency between different asylum instruments: the proposal provides for a single procedure, thus making it clear that applications should be considered in the light of both forms of international protection set out in the Qualification Directive (refuges status and subsidiary protection status). It further specifies the rules applicable in the single procedure, such as a mandatory sequence of an examination of the protection needs in relation to refugee status and subsidiary protection status, and extends the present rules on the withdrawal of refugee status to cases of the withdrawal of subsidiary protection. (b) scope: the proposal makes it clear that the procedural principles and guarantees set out in the Asylum Procedures Directive apply to applicants who are the subject to procedures pursuant to the Dublin Regulation  in the second Member State . It underlines that the notion of implicit withdrawal of applications should not be an obstacle for applicants to re-access asylum procedures in the responsible Member State. (c) access to procedures: the proposal provides for a number of guarantees aimed at enhancing access to asylum procedures: it explicitly includes territorial waters in the scope of the Directive and specifies the obligations of border guards, police and personnel of detention facilities; it provides for a time limit for completing formalities related to the lodging of an application; it introduces guarantees aimed at enabling de facto asylum seekers to articulate their request for protection when they are present at the border crossing points or pre-removal detention facilities. (d) procedural guarantees in procedures at first instance: the proposal aims to increase the overall level of fairness in asylum procedures, thus leading to more consistent application of agreed procedural principles and guarantees. The proposed changes would: reduce exceptions to the procedural principles and guarantees set out in the present Directive. In particular, the proposal deletes the possibility to omit a personal interview in accelerated procedures; provide for additional guarantees, such as the right to free legal assistance for applicants for international protection in procedures at first instance; introduce special guarantees for vulnerable asylum applicants. These include, among other things, rules dealing with medico-legal reports, exemption of certain categories of applicants from accelerated or border procedures and procedural arrangements aimed at establishing the elements of the application in cases involving gender and/or age based persecution. (e) prevention of abuse of procedures: the measures envisaged would also contribute to preventing abuse of procedures by improving applicants' awareness of applicable requirements leading inter alia to better compliance with procedural obligations. They would also support efforts of asylum authorities to take defendable and robust decisions, based on complete and properly established factual circumstances of the claim. It is in this context that the following changes are made with a view to strengthening procedural arrangements: inadmissibility decisions: according to the proposal, the applicant concerned should be able to make his/her views with regard to the application of the inadmissibility grounds known to the authorities before a decision to consider an application inadmissible has been taken; notion of a safe third country: the proposal deletes the European safe third country notion and incorporates the grounds of subsidiary protection in the list of material requirements for the application of the safe third country notion; manifestly unfounded applications: the proposal also revises the present arrangements for accelerated procedures providing for a limited and exhaustive list of grounds for an accelerated examination of manifestly unfounded applications and underlines that the determining authority should be given sufficient time to carry out a rigorous examination of an application in such cases. These measures are further strengthened by underlining the principle of a single determining authority. The latter amendment accommodates institutional arrangements of the majority of Member States and is indispensable with a view to ensuring the availability of institutional expertise and delivering robust determinations, based on complete and accurately established factual circumstances; time limits for procedures at first instance: the envisaged general 6 month time limit accommodates legislative amendments and/or practices of the majority of Member States, consulted in the process of preparing the amendments. It is instrumental in improving the efficiency of examinations, reducing reception costs, facilitating removal of failed asylum seekers and ensuring quicker access to protection for genuine refugees and persons in need of subsidiary protection. The amendments also provide for the possibility of extending the time limit for 6 more months in individual cases; subsequent applications: the proposal further consolidates the Directive's provisions dealing with subsequent applications with a view to enabling Member States to subject a subsequent application to an admissibility test in line with the res judicata principle and to derogate from the right to remain in the territory in cases of multiple subsequent applications thus preventing abuse of asylum procedures. safe country of origin: the proposal deletes the notion of a minimum common list of safe countries of origin and consolidates the common objective criteria for the national designation of third countries as safe countries of origin. These notions and devices have been revised to providing asylum authorities with necessary procedural tools to prevent / respond to abuse and process quickly clearly unfounded or less complex applications. In order to reduce the root causes of repeated applications, the proposal makes it clear that the applicant and the determining authority should take all necessary efforts to establish and assess the elements of the initial application in line with the cooperative requirement set out in Article 4(1) of the Qualification Directive. (f) access to effective remedy: lastly, the proposal facilitates access to effective remedy for asylum applicants in line with Community and international obligations of Member States. The proposal provides for a full and ex nunc review of first instance decisions by a court or tribunal and specifies that the notion of effective remedy requires a review of both facts and points of law. Furthermore, the proposal aims at bringing the appeal proceedings pursuant to the Directive in line with the ""equality of arms"" principle and, subject to limited exceptions, provides for automatic suspensive effect of appeals against first instance decisions on applications for international protection."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 on the measures that may be taken by the Community following a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The purpose of this proposal is to establish specific provisions with a view to permitting the Union, where it considers this appropriate, to bring a measure taken under Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 (anti-dumping measures) or Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 (anti-subsidy measures) into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in a report adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. In concrete terms, the Commission may: (a) repeal or amend the disputed measure; or (b) adopt any other special implementing measure deemed to be appropriate in the circumstances in order to bring the Union into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in the report. In addition, the Commission should be able, where appropriate, to suspend or review such measures. Any measures adopted pursuant to this Regulation shall take effect from the date of their entry into force and shall not serve as basis for the reimbursement of the duties collected prior to that date, unless otherwise provided for. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The proposal stipulates that the advisory procedure should be used for the suspension of measures for a limited period of time given the effects of such measures."

BACKGROUND: designed to support the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative ""Innovation Union"", the basic principle of ""Horizon 2020"" is to adopt a much more strategic approach to research and innovation. All policy instruments and measures are designed to contribute to research and innovation and to develop further the European Research Area whereby knowledge, researchers and technology circulate freely, and to accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation across the Single Market. The set consists of the proposals for: ·  a Framework Programme for Horizon 2020; ·  a single set of Rules for Participation and Dissemination; ·  a single specific programme to implement Horizon 2020; ·  a single proposal for the parts of Horizon 2020 corresponding to the Euratom Treaty. Horizon 2020 contributes directly to tackling the major societal challenges identified in Europe 2020 and its flagship initiatives. It will contribute equally to creating industrial leadership in Europe. It will also increase excellence in the science base, essential for the sustainability and long term prosperity and wellbeing of Europe. To achieve these aims, the proposals include a full range of support that is integrated across the research and innovation cycle. Horizon 2020 therefore brings together and strengthens activities currently funded under the 7th Framework Programme for research, the innovation parts of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. In this way, the proposals are also designed to realise a substantial simplification for participants. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposals rely on two in-depth impact assessments, drawing on stakeholder consultations, internal and external evaluations, and contributions from international experts. The assessments found that the Horizon 2020 option would bring more clarity of focus, best achieve the necessary critical mass of effort at programme and project level, and lead to greatest impact on the policy objectives and downstream economic, competitiveness, and social benefits, while at the same time helping to simplify matters by e.g. easing the administrative burden for participants, streamlining the applicable rules and procedures, ensuring consistency between instruments and pointing to a new risk/trust balance. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 173(3) and 182(1) TFEU. CONTENT: this Regulation establishes Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) and determines the framework governing Union support to research and innovation activities and fostering better exploitation of the industrial potential of policies of innovation, research and technological development. Union added value: Horizon 2020 will play a central role in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth by providing a common strategic framework for the Union's research and innovation funding, thus acting as a vehicle for leveraging private investment, creating new job opportunities and ensuring Europe's long-term sustainable growth and competitiveness. The proposals have been designed to maximise Union added value and impact, focusing on objectives and activities that cannot be efficiently realised by Member States acting alone. Union level intervention: ·  can strengthen the overall research and innovation framework and coordinate Member States' research efforts thereby avoiding duplication, retaining critical mass in key areas and ensuring public financing is used in an optimal way; ·  will enable continent-wide competition to select the best proposals, thereby raising levels of excellence and providing visibility for leading research and innovation; ·  is best placed to support trans-national mobility, thereby improving training and career development for researchers; ·  is more able to take on high risk and long-term R&D, thereby sharing the risk and generating a breadth of scope and economies of scale that could not otherwise be achieved; ·  can leverage additional public and private investments in research and innovation; ·  can contribute to the European Research Area whereby knowledge, researchers and technology circulate freely, and accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovations across the Single Market. General objective, priorities and specific objectives: Horizon 2020 shall contribute to building an economy based on knowledge and innovation across the whole Union by leveraging sufficient additional research, development and innovation funding. Thereby, it shall support the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and other Union policies, as well as the achievement and functioning of the European Research Area (ERA). This general objective shall be pursued through three mutually reinforcing priorities dedicated to: (a) excellent science; (b) industrial leadership; (c) societal challenges. The Joint Research Centre shall contribute to the general objective and priorities by providing scientific and technical support to Union policies. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) set up by Regulation (EU) No 294/2008 shall contribute to the general objective and priorities with the specific objective of integrating the knowledge triangle of research, innovation and education. The relevant performance indicators for the EIT and JRC are set out in the text. The Commission may use, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, existing executive agencies for the implementation of Horizon 2020, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Union programmes.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union, invoking the procedure set out in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The EUSF was created in 2002 to support EU Member States and accession countries in situations of major disasters caused by natural events such as floods, storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, forest fires or drought. The Fund can be mobilised upon an application from the concerned country if the disaster event has a dimension justifying intervention at European level. While it will be a singular event, its disruptive effects and the burden thereof on public finances, directly imputable to the event of a withdrawal without an agreement, could constitute a major disaster and therefore the activation of the “solidarity principle”, which is the core of the EUSF, would be justified in order to mitigate those effects. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in order to extend its scope to certain types of additional public expenditure caused by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union without agreement. Scope and eligibility Under the amending Regulation, the notion of 'major disasters' would cover natural disasters as well as situations where serious financial burden is inflicted on a Member State as a direct consequence of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement. The Commission proposes to take the financial burden on Member States’ budgets in order to face the additional needs stemming from and directly linked to a withdrawal without an agreement as the reference to determine eligibility. Access to the EUSF would be determined by a minimum level of public expenditure related to the withdrawal without agreement set at 0.3% of GNI or EUR 1.5 billion (whichever is lower), at 2011 prices, half the threshold for natural disasters. It is for the Member State to provide evidence for that expenditure and to demonstrate that it is directly imputable to the withdrawal without agreement. Such assistance may be used, for example, to provide support to businesses affected by the withdrawal without an agreement, including support to State aid measures for those businesses and related interventions; measures to preserve existing employment; and to ensure the functioning of border, customs, sanitary and phytosanitary controls, including additional personnel and infrastructure. VAT shall not constitute eligible expenditure. Procedure The competent national authorities of a Member State could submit to the Commission, by 30 April 2020 at the latest, a single application for a financial contribution from the Fund. The application should include at least all relevant information on the financial burden borne by that Member State. Where the Commission concludes that the conditions for granting a financial contribution from the Fund are met, it should without delay submit to the European Parliament and the Council the necessary proposals to trigger the intervention of the Fund and authorise the corresponding appropriations. When submitting an application for a financial contribution from the Fund to the Commission for serious financial burden caused by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement, a Member State may request the payment of an advance. The Commission therefore proposes to raise the level of advance payments for individual disasters of all categories to 25% of the expected EUSF contribution, limited to a maximum of EUR 100 million. It also proposes to increase the total level of appropriations for EUSF advances in the annual budget from EUR 50 million to EUR 100 million. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in order to maintain the availability of the EUSF for major natural disasters, which is its original purpose, the use of the EUSF for the purpose of the present proposal should be limited to a maximum of 50% of its annual available amount in 2019 and 2020. The maximum annual allocation of the EUSF is EUR 500 million in 2011 prices. In current prices this means EUR 585.8 million for 2019 plus EUR 597.5 million for 2020, i.e. a total of EUR 1 183.3 million. Up to EUR 591.65 million would therefore be available for the purpose of the current proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event of serious emergencies whose scale and scope affect the whole of the European Union, a collective, coordinated and urgent response is needed to avoid a fragmented approach that would limit the effectiveness of the Union's response. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the need for better European Union preparedness for future large-scale emergencies, while highlighting the limitations of the current framework. In this context, it is proposed to make further amendments to the existing legal framework in order to strengthen the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The Union Mechanism has showed encouraging results in terms of performance in each of the three pillars (prevention/preparedness/response) so far. The Mechanism has proven to be a useful tool to mobilise and coordinate the assistance provided by the Participating States responding to crises inside and outside the Union, constituting a tangible proof of European solidarity. The Mechanism is generally well perceived by the participating States and key stakeholders. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to make certain targeted amendments to Council Decision No 1313/2013/EU on the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism. Building on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility, the overall objective of this proposal is to ensure that the Union can provide a better crisis and emergency support to its citizens in Europe and beyond. The decision is to be considered in parallel with the proposal also amending this mechanism. In line with the proposal for the new MFF 2021-2027, funding related to civil protection has been integrated into a single heading: Heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’. Objectives Specifically, the proposed amendments have the following objectives: - reinforce a cross-sectoral and societal preparedness approach to trans-boundary disaster risk management, including establishing a baseline and planning elements at a European level; - ensure that the Commission is able to directly procure an adequate safety net of rescEU capacities; - provide the Commission with the logistical capacity to provide multi-purpose air services in case of emergencies and to ensure timely transport and delivery of assistance; d) design a more flexible system for response to large-scale emergencies; - enhance the Emergency Response Coordination Centre’s operational coordination and monitoring role in support of the EU’s swift and effective response to a broad range of crises inside and outside the Union. The ERCC would be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and would be at the service of the Member States and the Commission in achieving the objectives of the Union's mechanism; - enable stronger investment in preparedness at Union level and further simplification of budget implementation; - enable the financing of operations of efficient and scalable sustainable recovery and resilience measures under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism by external assigned revenues through financing made available under the draft Regulation establishing a European Union Recovery Instrument to support the recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proposal envisages the deletion of Annex I, which currently establishes the relative percentages that each pillar of the Union Mechanism (prevention, preparedness and response) should receive in terms of funding from the overall financial envelope. As the COVID-19 outbreak has shown, the percentages outlined in Annex I do not appear to ensure sufficient flexibility so that the Union can achieve the objectives it has set. The proposal stresses the need for close coordination with actions under other EU policies and instruments, in particular with the new EU programme EU4Health. Proposed budget The total budget allocated for the Union Civil Protection Mechanism amounts to EUR 3 455 902 000 (in current prices) for the 2021-2027 period: - EUR 1 268 282 000 shall derive from heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’ of the MFF 2021-2027; - EUR 2 187 620 000 shall be made available through the European Recovery Instrument based on empowerment provided in the new Own Resources Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union has concluded a number of multilateral, regional and bilateral international trade agreements creating rights and obligations for the mutual benefit of the parties. The Union may be called on to take unilateral measures to enforce and defend its rights and interests under international trade agreements. This is the case under the dispute settlement rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as well as under bilateral or regional dispute settlement mechanisms. The Union currently does not have a common legislative framework to enforce its rights under international trade agreements. However, it is essential that the Union possesses appropriate instruments to ensure the effective exercise of the Union's rights under international trade agreements, in order to safeguard its economic interests. This is particularly the case in situations where third countries enact restrictive trade measures that diminish the benefits accruing to the Union's economic operators under international trade agreements. The Union should be in a position to react swiftly and in a flexible manner in the context of the procedures and deadlines set out by the international trade agreements which it has concluded. Prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Union approached enforcement in an ad hoc manner in the form of Regulations adopted by the Council on the basis of a Commission proposal. After the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Council and the European Parliament are co-legislators under the ordinary legislative procedure in relation to the measures defining the framework for implementing the common commercial policy. Enforcement of rights under international trade agreements is a typical executive function that may require adopting and implementing measures within strict deadlines. It is appropriate for the Council and the European Parliament to establish a clear and predictable framework for the adoption of any such acts. The present proposal reflects the Union's priority to enforce effectively its trade rights. This objective was set out in the Commission Communication on "" Trade, growth and world affairs "" and endorsed in the Council conclusions of 21 December 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Regulation must be adopted at Union level. The common commercial policy is an exclusive competence of the Union. CONTENT: this draft Regulation proposes the creation of a common legislative framework to enforce the Union's rights under international trade agreements, in line with the Treaty of Lisbon. It lays down rules and procedures in order to ensure an effective exercise of the Union's rights to suspend or withdraw concessions or other obligations under international trade agreements, with the aim of: responding to breaches by third countries of international trade rules which affect the interests of the Union, with a view to seeking a satisfactory solution; rebalancing concessions or other obligations in the trade relations with third countries, when the import treatment accorded to goods from the Union is altered. Its objective is efficient and swift implementation with a view to safeguarding the Union's interest. Accordingly, on the basis of Article 207 of the TFEU, it proposes to empower the Commission to adopt, suspend, modify or terminate implementing acts to enforce the Union's rights within the structure of the Treaty of Lisbon, i.e. in accordance with Article 291 of the TFEU. The scope of the Regulation extends to the adoption, suspension, modification and termination of implementing acts with regard to: enforcement of the Union's rights under binding multilateral and bilateral dispute settlement rules; rebalancing measures under multilateral and bilateral safeguard rules; rebalancing measures in cases of modifications by a third country of its concessions under Article XXVIII GATT 1994. Conditions and criteria : implementing acts shall respect the rule that the level of countermeasures should not exceed the level of nullification and impairment, generally intended as the adverse impact on the Union resulting from the third country measure, as defined in the relevant agreement. In determining the scope of the implementing act to be adopted, the Commission shall also rely on various criteria, such as: (i) the effectiveness of the measures in inducing compliance of third countries with international trade rules; (ii) the potential of the measures to provide relief to economic operators within the Union affected by third country measures; (iii) availability of alternative sources of supply for the products concerned, in order to avoid or minimise any negative impact on downstream industries or final consumers within the Union. Types of measures : under the present draft Regulation, the Commission may adopt the following types of commercial policy measures: customs duties, quantitative restrictions on imports or exports of goods, and measures in the area of public procurement. Due to the particularities of public procurement, in particular the existence of an administrative procedure that regulates and determines access to specific calls for tenders, it is possible to envisage action as regards the procurement of both goods and services. In this regard, the type of commercial policy measures that may be enacted concern the exclusion from public procurement of tenders the total value of which represents more than 50% of goods or services originating in the third country concerned. A review clause provides that the Commission shall assess the operation of this Regulation three years after the first instance of its implementation occurred. The Commission shall issue a report and, if the circumstances so warrant, may propose appropriate measures to improve the Regulation’s efficiency. In this context, consideration can be given to the range of commercial policy measures under the Regulation such as trade in services and intellectual property rights, in addition to goods."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 provides for ‘Union General export authorisations’ which facilitate controls on low-risk exports of dual-use items to certain third countries. Currently, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, including Liechtenstein, and the United States of America are covered by Union General export authorisation No. EU001. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, all EU legislation on the import and export of goods shall apply to goods moving between the EU and the United Kingdom. Considering that the United Kingdom is an important destination for dual-use items produced in the Union, it is appropriate to add the United Kingdom to the list of destinations covered by the Union General export authorisations No. EU001 in order to ensure a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the Union, to promote a level playing field for Union exporters and to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden, while protecting Union and international security. The Commission recalls that the United Kingdom is a party to relevant international treaties and a member of international non-proliferation regimes and that it maintains full compliance with related obligations and commitments, and applies proportionate and adequate controls to effectively address considerations about intended end use and the risk of diversion consistent with the provisions. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 aims to add the United Kingdom to the list of destinations covered by the Union General export authorisation for dual-use items only in a situation where no withdrawal agreement is concluded with the United Kingdom. Given the urgency entailed by the circumstances of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, it is necessary to allow for a prompt application of the provisions provided for in this Regulation, i.e. on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: work on the creation of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) started in May 1999, on the basis of the principles approved by the Tampere European Council. During the first phase of the CEAS (1999-2005), the goal was to harmonise Member States' legal frameworks on the basis of minimum standards. Directive 2004/83/EC, otherwise known as the ‘Qualification Directive’ was adopted with the purpose of defining common criteria for the identification of persons in need of international protection and to ensure that at least a minimum level of benefits is available for these persons in all Member States. It is one of the key components of five EU legislative instruments in the area of asylum adopted in the context of the first phase. This proposal falls within the Policy Plan on Asylum which provides for the second phase of the CEAS. It aims to address the deficiencies in procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection and to ensure higher and more harmonised standards of protection, thus progressing towards a common asylum procedure and a uniform status. The amendments that have been proposed are drawn from the responses received to the Commission’s consultation on the Green Paper on the future of the Common European Asylum System which highlighted deficiencies concerning the terms of the Directive and the manner in which it is applied in practice. The minimum standards envisaged in 2004 are vague and ambiguous, in certain aspects, thus resulting in legal uncertainty. In view of the lack of clarity in regard to certain provisions and the incompatibility of certain standards with human rights or the applicable international law, the Commission proposes to recast the 2004 text at the same time as the recasting of Council Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (""Asylum Procedures Directive”). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: because of the variety of reasons underlying the difficulties in applying this directive, it was impossible to identify a single all-embracing option. The Commission’s impact assessment thus comprises a series of strategic options that would: i) restrict the broad interpretations of the notions of “actors of protection” and “internal protection” so that they are more compatible with the applicable international standards (Geneva Convention and European Court of Human Rights); ii) guarantee a broader interpretation of the notion of a ‘particular social group’ by defining better the importance to be accorded to aspects relating to the gender of asylum seekers; iii) reduce the difference between the rights of those with subsidiary protection and of refugees by removing certain provisions that are not justified; iv) improve the integration of beneficiaries of protection by taking into account their specific needs (e.g. assistance to find jobs, housing, ....); v) strengthen respect for the right to family life of beneficiaries of protection to cover minors, in the best interests of the child. CONTENT: the proposed amendments should contribute to: · the simplification of decision-making procedures leading to more robust determinations in the first instance, thus preventing abuse; · the rationalisation of the procedures for the granting of rights, thus improving the efficiency of the asylum procedures and reducing secondary asylum movements resulting from the coexistence of differing national decision-making practices and legal frameworks; · ensuring consistency with the jurisprudence with respect to human rights of the European Court of Justice and of the European Court of Human Rights. The main proposed changes to the provisions may be summarised as follows: a) “actors of protection” : the lack of clarity of the concept allows for wide divergences and for very broad interpretations which may fall short of the standards set by the Geneva Convention on what constitutes ‘adequate protection’. It also lays down that protection should be effective and durable and that non-state actors of protection should be willing and able to enforce the rule of law. The condition that protection should be effective and durable ensures coherence with Article 11(2) of the Directive, which requires, for the purposes of cessation, that the change of circumstances in the country of origin should be significant and of non-temporary nature; b) internal protection : the purpose and content of international protection are not limited to non-refoulement. It is necessary thus to specify that it may be withheld only where protectionis available in at least part of the country of origin. · introduces verbatim the pre-conditions set out in the above judgment for the applicability of the concept of internal protection, namely that the applicant should be able to travel, gain admittance and settle in the alternative location; · deletes the possibility to apply the internal flight alternative; · includes a reference to the obligation of the authorities to obtain precise and up-to-date information on the general situation in the country. c) the ""causal link"" requirement : in many cases where the persecution emanates from non-State actors, such as militia, clans, criminal networks, local communities or families, the act of persecution is not committed for reasons related to a Geneva Convention ground but, for instance, with criminal motivations or for private revenge. However, it often happens in such cases that the State is unable or unwilling to provide protection to the individual concerned (for example religion, gender, ethnicity etc). To address potential protection gaps, the proposal makes explicit that the requirement of a connection between the acts of persecution and the reasons for persecution is also fulfilled where there is a connection between the acts of persecution and the absence of protection against such acts. d) membership of a particular social group : gender as such is normally not sufficient as a criterion for the definition of a particular social group; it is generally used in combination with other factors, such as class, marital status, ethnic or clan affiliation. However, women may form a particular social group in some societies, as evidenced by discrimination in their fundamental rights. The ambiguous wording of the last phrase of Article 10(1)(d) allows for protection gaps and for very divergent interpretations. In order to provide clear and useful guidance and ensure consistency, the amendment specifies that gender should be given due consideration for the purposes of defining a particular social group. e) cessation of refugee and subsidiary protection status : references to the exceptions to the “ceased circumstances” cessation clauses, set out in the Geneva Convention, have been omitted from the Qualification Directive. These exceptions provide for the continuation of protection for ""compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution"" and are interpreted as reflecting a general humanitarian principle. The proposal introduces these exceptions with regard both to refugee status and to subsidiary protection. f) differentiation regarding the content of the two protection statuses : an amendment expected to significantly simplify and streamline procedures and to reduce administrative costs is aimed at approximating the rights granted to the two categories of beneficiaries of protection. When subsidiary protection was introduced, it was assumed that this status was of a temporary nature. As a result, the Directive allows Member States the discretion to grant them a lower level of rights in certain respects. However, practical experience acquired so far has shown that this initial assumption was not accurate. It is thus necessary to remove any limitations of the rights of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection which can no longer be considered as necessary and objectively justified. Such an approximation of rights is necessary to ensure full respect of the principle of non-discrimination and responds moreover to the call of the Hague Programme for the creation of a uniform status of protection. g) content of protection : to ensure the effective exercise of the rights formally granted to beneficiaries of protection, it is necessary to address the specific integration challenges they face, in particular: · recognition of qualifications : In order to address the practical difficulties flowing from their inability to provide documentary evidence and their limited financial capacities, the proposal encourages Member States to adopt alternative appropriate procedures and exempt them from the fees involved or grant them financial assistance, where necessary. · access to vocational training and employment : beneficiaries of protection are often unable to work for years or they are unfamiliar with labour market requirements and recruitment practices. The proposal obliges Member States to offer them access to training courses to upgrade their skills and to counselling services offered by employment offices; · access to integration facilities : The effective integration opportunities of beneficiaries of protection would be significantly enhanced if the different educational and professional backgrounds or other specificities of their situation were adequately taken into account in the integration facilities. The proposal requires Member States to develop in their integration policies the response that they consider appropriate to meet those specific needs; · access to accommodation : Many beneficiaries of protection experience direct and indirect discrimination in the housing market. The proposal calls on Member States to put in place policies aimed at preventing discrimination and achieving equality of opportunity; possibilities for reduction of benefits in cases of ""manufactured"" claims : these possibilities are not conducive to integration and raise concerns from the perspective of the principle of non-discrimination. Furthermore, their limited use in practice points to their limited added value. h) family members : the definition of family members is extended so as to take into account the case where the beneficiary of protection is a minor and the wide range of situations where a minor might be dependent, while ensuring that the decisive criterion is the best interest of the child."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) entered into force on 13 February 2003. Member States were required to transpose the requirements of the Directive by 13 August 2004. The extensive analysis carried out as part of the WEEE review process led to the identification of the following problems related to the application of the WEEE Directive: there is lack of clarity on the products covered by the current WEEE Directive and their categorisation, with different interpretations by different Member States and stakeholders; currently approximately 65% of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market is collected separately, but less than half of this is treated and reported according to the requirements of the Directive. The remainder potentially leaks out to substandard treatment and is illegally exported to third countries, including non-OECD countries. This leads to losses of valuable secondary raw materials and increases the risk of release of hazardous substances into the environment; the current collection rate, 4kg/inhabitant per year of WEEE from private households, (""one size fits all"") does not reflect the economies of individual Member States and thus leads to sub-optimal targets for some countries and too ambitious targets for others; currently there are no targets for the re-use of whole appliances in the Directive; there are no detailed enforcement requirements in the Directive, which results in lack of enforcement in Member States; there are diverging producer registration requirements in Member States; indications on substandard treatment of WEEE in the EU and illegal export of WEEE outside the EU are highlighted. The specific objectives of the review of the WEEE Directive are therefore: reduced administrative costs through the removal of all unnecessary administrative burdens, without lowering the level of environmental protection; improved effectiveness and implementation of the Directive through increased compliance and reduced free-riding; reduced impacts on the environment from the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE at the levels where the greatest net benefit to society results. The proposed measures are as follows: Scope : it is proposed to bring Annex IA and IB of Directive 2002/96/EC describing the scope for both the WEEE Directive and the Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS Directive) under the RoHS Directive, which is based on Article 95 of Treaty. The WEEE Directive, based on Article 175 of the EC Treaty, will refer to this scope. Clarification of definitions : clarification is proposed on the distinction between WEEE from private households (B2C) and non household WEEE (B2B) by classifying the equipment as either B2C or B2B through the comitology procedure. These actions will contribute to better clarification of which products fall under the WEEE Directive and will further clarify the obligations applying to different producers of equipment. Collection target : a 65% WEEE collection rate (including B2B equipment) is proposed which is set according to the average quantity of EEE placed on the market in the two preceding years. This target reflects the amounts of WEEE which are currently already collected separately in the Member States and takes the variations in EEE consumption in individual Member States into account. Therefore, it will encourage Member States to target an optimal rate of separate WEEE collection. The proposed collection rate should be achieved annually, starting in 2016. There are certain degrees of flexibility: possible transitional measures for Member States and a re-examination of the rate by the European Parliament and the Council in 2012, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. Recycling targets : in order to encourage the re-use of whole WEEEs, it is proposed to include the re-use of whole appliances in the increased target (by 5%) for recycling combined with re-use. The recycling target for medical devices (category 8 equipment) is proposed to be set at the same level as that for monitoring and control instruments (category 9 equipment). Producer registration : in order to reduce the administrative burden, the registration and reporting obligations for producers, which are specified by the different national producer registers, should be harmonised, including making the registers interoperable. Enforcement : in order to bridge the implementation gap, it is proposed to set minimum inspection requirements for Member States, in order to strengthen the enforcement of the WEEE Directive. Minimum monitoring requirements are proposed for shipments of WEEE."

Note on legal basis: the Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the common foreign and security policy, the common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. Article 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part. Accordingly, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207 TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. No additional provisions are required as legal basis CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The purpose of the Agreement is ‘to establish a strengthened partnership between the Parties and to deepen and enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest, reflecting shared values and common principles, including through intensifying high-level dialogue.’ The content of the Agreement covers three pillars: - political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora. The Agreement includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements signed by the EU; - cooperation on economic and trade matters, including economic policy dialogue, promoting trade and investment matters, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as : - sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of: - Institutional framework: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement includes a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements. Once in force, the Agreement will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU’s relations with New Zealand."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if the European Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the unprecedented measures put in place by Member States to contain the spread of COVID-19, in particular measures concerning confinement and social distancing of persons, may prevent companies and cooperative societies from complying with their legal obligations under national and Union company law, in particular, by making it considerably difficult for them to hold general meetings. At EU level, European Companies (SEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 and European Cooperative Societies (SCEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003. Both Regulations require a general meeting to be held within six months of the end of the financial year. In view of the current exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary derogation from this requirement should be granted. Many Member States have already allowed the use of digital tools and processes for holding general meetings and have extended the deadlines for holding general meetings in 2020. CONTENT: the holding of the general meeting is essential to ensure that legally binding or economically necessary decisions are taken in a timely manner. Under the draft Council Regulation, SEs and SCEs should be allowed to hold their general meeting within 12 months of the end of the financial year, provided that it takes place no later than 31 December 2020. As this derogation is a temporary measure due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it should only apply to general meetings that are required to be held in 2020. The proposed Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/6/EC requires Member States to accept certain standardised forms (hereinafter, ‘FAL forms’) in order to facilitate traffic, as defined by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention designed to facilitate international maritime traffic (hereinafter, ‘FAL Convention’). Directive 2002/6/EC must be replaced in order to meet the following needs: review of the FAL Convention and consistency with other Community legislative acts: the changes to Community legislation and the FAL Convention are causing greater administrative complexity in the field of maritime transport, which should be reduced while avoiding any reduction in maritime safety, maritime security and environmental protection; a new security information form to be provided prior to entry into a port in a Member State: the Commission has provided the maritime security committee (the ‘MARSEC committee’), established under Regulation No 725/2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, with a draft form designed to ensure harmonisation of information requests. The committee approved this harmonised draft information form in March 2005. Until the adoption of a harmonised form of this type at international level, the Commission is proposing as an interim measure the form approved by the MARSEC committee; insufficient information and duplication of authorities in ports: this results in an increase in repetitive work and a potential cause of slowness or errors which could be eliminated if the use of electronic data transmission systems was more widespread; inconsistent application of Directive 2002/6/EC: a study of 40 ports carried out by the European Maritime Safety Agency showed that although the Directive was generally well implemented by the Member States, it did not always enable the intended objective of simplification to be achieved. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three options were considered: (a) no measure being taken at Community level; (b) given that checks conducted on goods circulating within the internal market are derived from various pieces of legislation, each of them being the subject of simplification on a case-by-case basis; (c) a series of coherent measures being adopted in order to eliminate administrative obstacles to the free movement of Community goods or similar between EU ports. The option chosen by the Commission is option (c). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal for a Directive is to reduce the amount of information to be repeatedly provided to the various port authorities. To this end, it is felt that the transmission of information as provided for in Directives 95/21/EC, 2002/59/EC and 2000/59/EC and Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 and, if necessary, the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, contain all navigation information required by the authorities upon arrival at and/or departure from ports. The Commission proposes, inter alia: to establish a 24-hour deadline by which the information required must be sent, in compliance with the deadlines stipulated in Directive 2002/59/EC and Regulation (EC) No 725/2004; to require Member States to appoint a single competent authority at national level for the collation of information required at entry to and/or exit from European Union ports, which shall be the authority designated for the implementation of SafeSeaNet; to make the use of electronic means of transmission commonplace as soon as possible and by 13 February 2013 at the latest, this being the date given in Decision 70/2008/EC on a paperless environment for customs and trade; to exempt those moving between ports situated within the European Community's customs territory from sending FAL forms, provided that the goods are presumed to have Community status."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the entry into force of the TFEU, the powers delegated to the Commission must be aligned with Article 290 (delegated acts), and Article 291 (implementing acts). The Commission has made a commitment to review legislative acts which currently contain references to regulatory procedure with scrutiny in the light of the criteria laid down in the Treaty. The overall objective is to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments by the end of Parliament’s seventh term (June 2014). Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community contains references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny and should therefore be reviewed in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU. The EU Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the biggest household survey in Europe. The results produced form the backbone of the statistical information system on labour markets in the European Union. In particular, the LFS provides the indicators for three of the Europe 2020 headline targets. Each year, the core LFS is supplemented with an ad hoc module, which serves predominantly European policy initiatives, such as the European Employment Strategy, the Youth on the Move flagship initiative, the Strategy for Equality between Women and Men, the European agenda for integration and the Employment Package. The sustainable production of high-quality ad hoc module data is of utmost importance to EU decision-makers, and thus it is proposed that a provision on financing be integrated into the Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the main objectives of the proposal are as follows: 1) Amend Regulation (EC) No 577/98 in order to align it to the new institutional context. The Commission may adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU: (i) the content of the ad hoc modules, the definitions and any adjustment of the list of survey variables made necessary by the evolution of techniques and concepts; (ii) the list of structural variables, including the minimum sample size and the survey frequency. Implementing powers are conferred upon the Commission with a view to ensuring uniform conditions concerning the transmission of statistical information, in particular by adopting the rules on the edits to be used, the codification of the variables and the list of principles for the formulation of questions concerning labour status. 2) Allow the Commission to provide for a financial contribution. The contribution by the Union to the financing of the implementation of modules is proposed through grant procedures, without calls for proposals. The grants are to be awarded to the national statistical institutes and other national authorities referred to in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total amount in commitment and payment appropriations (operational appropriations and human resources) is estimated at EUR 15.890 million for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of targeted contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the basic Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy), Union fishing vessels enjoy equal access to EU waters and resources subject to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. From the end of the transitional period, the Common Fisheries Policy would no longer apply to the United Kingdom. The UK waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will then no longer be part of EU waters. To ensure sustainable fisheries and given the importance of fishing for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the authorisation procedures for fishing vessels. CONTENT: the proposal would amend EU Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 in order to create the appropriate legal framework valid until 31 December 2021, or until the date of conclusion of a fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom - whichever is earlier - on the continued reciprocal access of EU and UK vessels to each other's waters after 31 December 2020. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following the end of the transition period. The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ""reciprocity"", i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters on a basis satisfactory to the Union. Consequently, authorisations would only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Greece has been affected by the consequences of the financial crisis in a unique manner. It has led to persistently negative GDP growth rates in Greece over a number of years, which, in turn, has caused serious liquidity shortages and a lack of public funds available for the public investment needed to foster a sustainable recovery. This has created an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed with specific measures. However, it is vital that the lack of liquidity and of public funds in Greece do not hinder investment under programmes supported by the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund (the Funds) and by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). In its Communication entitled ""A new start for Jobs and Growth in Greece"", the Commission proposed measures to ensure that the available EU funding from the Funds and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), is effectively used for investments on the ground and reaches beneficiaries as rapidly as possible. CONTENT: as an exceptional measure and given the unique situation this has created in Greece, the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 on the common provisions on the European Structural and European Investment Funds as follows: in order to ensure that Greece has sufficient financial means to start the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes supported by the Funds and the EMFF in 2015 and 2016, the Commission proposes to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to its operational programmes under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Goal and to programmes supported by the EMFF through the payment of an additional initial prefinancing amount in those years to give an immediate boost to investment; in order to improve the effective use of available cohesion policy funding for the financing of operations under programmes adopted for the 2007-2013 period, it proposes to increase the maximum co-financing rates and to raise the ceiling for payments to programmes at the end of the programming period. In concrete terms, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to allow for the ceiling for the cumulative total of pre-financing and interim payments to be 100% and to increase the co-financing rate for 2007-2013 operational programmes for the Convergence and the Regional competitiveness and employment objectives in Greece to 100%. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed consists of frontloading payment appropriations and is budgetary neutral over the 2014-2020 period. The additional payment appropriations necessary to cover the immediate consequence of an increase of 2007-2013 co-financing rates and removal of the ceiling for payments are EUR 500 million in 2015 and EUR 500 million for the additional initial pre-financing in 2015. These additional payment appropriations can potentially be covered by payment appropriations foreseen for interim payments for the 2014-2020 programmes depending on the progress of submission of interim payment applications in 2015. The additional pre-financing of EUR 500 million for 2016 was however not foreseen in the draft budget 2016 . Nor was the impact in 2016 of the increase in the maximum co-financing rates and in the ceiling for payments for 2007-2013 programmes. The Commission is therefore likely to propose to cover the additional payment needs through an amending letter to the 2016 draft. The estimated impact on 2017 will be included in the next budgetary procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: all sectors of the economy need to contribute to achieving those emission reductions. Therefore, the ambition of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, should be adjusted to be in line with the economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitment for 2030. In order to address the structural imbalance between supply and demand of allowances in the market, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of the European Parliament and of the Council established a market stability reserve (MSR) in 2018, which has been operational since 2019. The reserve functions by triggering adjustments to the annual volumes of allowances to be auctioned. In order to preserve a maximum degree of predictability, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 established clear rules for placing and releasing allowances in the reserve. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The ‘Fit for 55’ package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. As part of this package, this proposal aims to increase the environmental contribution of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). As the MSR Decision currently stands, the 24 % intake rate of the MSR and the minimum amount to be placed in the reserve of 200 million allowances will expire in 2023. As from 2024, the intake rate would become 12 %. 12 % intake rate would not be enough to ensure that the objectives of the MSR in terms of reducing the surplus and ensuring market resilience would still be fulfilled. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission seeks to ensure that the current parameters of the MSR (intake rate of 24 % and minimum amount to be placed in the reserve of 200 million allowances) are maintained beyond 2023 and until the end of Phase IV of the EU ETS on 31 December 2030 to ensure market predictability. The MSR intake rate would revert to 12 % after 2030. Monitoring and reporting The Commission will continue to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the EU ETS, including the MSR, in its annual Carbon Market Report. The initiative builds on the process based on integrated national energy and climate plans and the robust transparency framework for greenhouse gas emissions and other climate information. The Commission will use the information submitted and reported by Member States under the Governance Regulation as a basis for its regular assessment of progress. This includes information on greenhouse gas emissions, policies and measures, projections and adaptation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: i n the post-Lisbon era and after the abolition of the third pillar the area of justice develops dynamically in order to respond to all challenges. Legislative and policy measures as well as their coherent implementation are key tools. Funding can contribute to the development of this area through supporting legislation and policy-making and promoting their implementation. In accordance with the Communication on the EU Budget Review, a fresh look was taken at the existing funding instruments and delivery mechanisms to ensure clear focus on European added value and to cater for rationalisation and simplification of the funding mechanisms. In ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’, the Commission identified the need for a simpler and more transparent budget to overcome the problems that arise from the complexity of programme structures and the existence of multiple programmes. The area of Rights was mentioned as an example of the existing fragmentation, where action should be taken. Within this framework and aiming at simplification and rationalisation, the Rights and Citizenship Programme is the successor of three current programmes: Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Daphne III, The Sections ""Antidiscrimination and Diversity"" and ""Gender Equality"" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS). The merge of these programmes will allow for a comprehensive funding approach in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: one impact assessment was carried out concerning the future funding activities for the whole area of justice, rights and equality, which currently comprises six programmes ( Civil Justice Programme, the Criminal Justice Programme, the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Daphne III Programme, the Drug Prevention and Information Programme and the sections ""Antidiscrimination and Diversity"" and ""Gender Equality"" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity ( PROGRESS )). The impact assessment has considered three options: Option A: to maintain six programmes and to address some of the identified problems through changes in the internal management of the programmes.; Option B: to maintain all measures of option A and additionally to merge the current six programmes into two programmes. This option would allow for flexibility in the use of funds and in addressing annual policy priorities. It would achieve increased simplification (both for the beneficiaries and the administration) and efficiency of the programmes, since significantly fewer procedures would be needed. The effectiveness of the programmes would also be improved as the fragmentation and dilution of funds would be addressed better within two programmes. Human resources could be freed, since fewer procedures would reduce the administrative burden and they would be allocated to activities improving the effectiveness of the programmes (dissemination of results, monitoring, providing information, etc). Option C: to implement only one programme. This option addresses all problems caused by the multiple legal instruments and by the increased administrative burden of managing multiple programmes. However, due to legal constraints the scope of this programme would not be able to cover the funding needs of all policy areas. A choice would have to be made between the area of justice and the area of rights and citizenship. Although this solution can deliver maximum impact in terms of management, however it would not be possible to address sufficiently the policy priorities and needs of the whole policy area. Resulting from the analysis and comparison of the options, the preferred option is the implementation of two programmes which would cover the funding needs of all policy areas (option B). In comparison to the status quo option B presents clear advantages and no disadvantage. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(1) and (2), Article 82(1) and Article 84 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission proposes to establish a new European Union programme on Justice 2014-2020. General objective : the general objective of the Programme shall be to contribute to the creation of a European area of justice by promoting judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. To achieve the general objective, the Programme shall have the following specific objectives: to promote effective, comprehensive and consistent application of Union legislation in the areas of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters; to facilitate access to justice; to prevent and reduce drug demand and supply. The proposal states that the indicator to measure the achievement of this objective shall be, inter alia, the number of cases of trans-border cooperation. The Programme shall aim to promote equality between women and men and combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in all its activities. Actions financed : the Programme shall finance inter alia the following types of actions: analytical activities , such as collection of data and statistics; development of common methodologies and, where appropriate, indicators or benchmarks; studies, researches, analyses and surveys; evaluations and impact assessments; training activities , such as staff exchanges, workshops, seminars, train-the-trainers events; mutual learning, cooperation, awareness raising and dissemination activities , such as identification of, and exchanges on, good practices, innovative approaches and experiences, organisation of peer review and mutual learning; support for main actors , such as support for Member States when implementing Union law and policies; support for key European level networks whose activities are linked to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme; funding of experts' networks; funding of European level observatories. European added value : the Commission shall ensure that the actions selected for funding are intended to produce results with European added value and shall monitor whether European added value was actually achieved through the final results of the actions financed by the Programme. Implementation : in implementing this Regulation the Commission will establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. The Programme can make use of all financial instruments foreseen in the Financial Regulation. The Commission may use, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, an existing executive agency for the implementation of the programme, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes. The programme may share resources with other Union instruments, in particular the Rights and Citizens Programme, in order to implement actions meeting the objectives of both programmes. Participation of the programme : ac cess to the Programme shall be open to all public and/or private bodies and entities legally established in: (a) Member States; (b) EFTA countries which are party to the EEA Agreement; (c) accession countries, candidate countries and potential candidates;(d) Denmark, on the basis of an international agreement. Under the Programme, the Commission may cooperate with international organisations active in the areas covered by the Programme, such as the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Access to the Programme shall be open to those international organisations. Monitoring and evaluation : the Commission shall monitor the Programme regularly. The monitoring will also provide a means of assessing the way in which gender equality and anti-discrimination issues have been addressed across the programme’s activities. Where relevant, indicators should be disaggregated by sex, age and disability. The Commission shall provide the European Parliament and the Council with: (a) an interim evaluation report, by mid-2018 at the latest; (b) an ex-post evaluation report. Complementarity : the Commission shall ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with other Union instruments, inter alia, with the Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Instrument for financial support for police cooperation, crime prevention and the fight against cross-border, serious and organised crime, the Health for Growth Programme, the Erasmus for all Programme, the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme and the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for the implementation of the Justice Programme for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 shall amount to EUR 472 million."

In all, it is estimated that: 3.7 million of Europeans are economically inactive mobile citizens; nearly 80 000 mobile citizens are entitled to long-term care benefits, totalling EUR 793 million (0.4% of the total EU expenditure on long-term care benefits); some 27 300 persons within the EU export their unemployment benefit to another Member State; there are 91 700 unemployed cross-border workers per year, 53 500 of whom are frontier workers. This initiative is part of the European Commission's labour mobility package of 2016. Its objective is to continue the process of modernisation of the EU law on social security coordination set out in Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and No 987/2009, by further facilitating the exercise of citizens' rights while ensuring legal clarity, a fair and equitable distribution of the financial burden among the Member States and administrative simplicity and enforceability of the rules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission’s preferred options include the following: to amend the current equal treatment provisions with regard to the access of economically inactive citizens to social benefits; the establishment of a coherent regime for long-term care benefits; new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases (aggregation of periods of insurance; the export of unemployment benefits; paying unemployment benefits to frontier workers); the coordination of family benefits intended to replace income during child-raising periods. CONTENT: the proposal focuses on four areas of coordination where improvements are required: (i) economically inactive citizens' access to social benefits, (ii) long-term care benefits, (iii) unemployment benefits and (iv) family benefits. Each Member State is free to determine the features of its own social security system - which benefits are provided, the conditions for eligibility, how these benefits are calculated and what contributions should be paid, and for all social security branches (old age, unemployment and family benefits), provided that such national provisions respect the principles of EU law in particular concerning equal treatment and non-discrimination. Access to social benefits claimed by economically inactive EU mobile citizens: further to recent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the proposal specifies that access to social security benefits for economically inactive mobile citizens in the host Member State, may be made conditional upon that citizen holding a legal right of residence in that Member State in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The proposal clearly distinguishes an economically inactive citizen from a jobseeker whose right of residence is conferred directly by Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Long-term care benefits: the proposed revision aims to establish a coherent regime for the coordination of long-term care benefits (currently dealt with under the sickness chapter) by introducing a separate Chapter for their coordination in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, by including a definition and providing for a list of those benefits. Unemployment benefits: the proposal sets out new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases. The proposal: requires a minimum qualifying period of three months insurance in the Member State of most recent activity before a right to aggregate past periods of insurance arises (while requiring the Member State of previous activity to provide benefits when this condition is not fulfilled); extends the minimum period for an export of unemployment benefits from three to six months while providing for the possibility of exporting the benefit for the whole period of entitlement. The aim is to improve the opportunities for unemployed persons moving to another Member State to look for work and their chances for reintegration into the labour market and to address skills mismatches across borders; makes the Member State of most recent employment responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits when the frontier worker has worked there for at least 12 months and otherwise attributing the responsibility to the Member State of residence. Child benefits : the proposal aims to change the current coordination provisions so that child-raising allowances are considered individual and personal rights and to permit an optional right for the secondary competent Member State to pay the benefit in full. Posted workers : the proposal clarifies the rules on applicable legislation and the relationship between the Regulations on coordination and Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. It strengthens the administrative rules on social security coordination in the fields of information exchange and verification of the social security status of such workers in order to prevent potentially unfair practices or abuse. Technical amendments : the proposed amendments concern: (i) the prioritisation of derived rights to sickness benefits; (ii) the reimbursement of costs for medical examination; (iii) the calculation of the annual average costs in the field of sickness benefits; and (iv) the introduction of measures to facilitate identification of fraud or error in the application of the Regulations, including the introduction of a permissive ground for Member States to periodically exchange personal data. Furthermore, the procedures for recovery of unduly paid social security benefits have been revised to align them with the equivalent procedures in Directive 2010/24/EU concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other measures. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 October 2006, Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) entered into force. After four years of practical application, the need for a number of limited technical amendments has emerged. The main sources for these amendments are: practical experiences of the Member States and the Commission in the application of the Schengen Borders Code, including the results of Schengen evaluations and the reports and requests submitted by Member States; the Commission reporton the operation of the provisions on stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of the Schengen Borders Code and Commission report on the application of Title III (Internal Borders) of the Schengen Borders Code; consistency considerations linked to other recently adopted legislation, in particular the Visa Code (Regulation (EC) No 810/2009) and the Return Directive (Directive 2008/115/EC). This proposal contains amendments that improve clarity and narrow the scope for divergent interpretations of the existing text as well as amendments responding to practical problems that have arisen during the first years of the Schengen Borders Code. Furthermore it provides for an explicit legal framework for bilateral agreements related to joint border checks on road traffic. New policy initiatives, such as the creation of an EU Entry/Exit System and an EU Registered Traveller Programme, will be the subject of specific proposals to be discussed separately. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77(1) and 77(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The main proposed amendments concern the following issues: Definitions : the proposal provides a clear definition of the method for calculating ‘stays not exceeding three months per six month period’ (Article 5). Following the judgment delivered by the ECJ on 3 October 2006 in Case C-241/05, Bot, and the adoption of a related parallel provision in Article 2(2)(a) of the Visa Code, clarified and authentic legislative guidance on this issue is needed for the Schengen Borders Code. The definition of residence permit is also reshaped. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, it is made clear that visas (both long-stay and short-stay) can never be considered as ‘residence permits’ within the meaning of point 15(b). Duration of the validity of certain travel documents : a clarification is made concerning the required period of validity of travel documents of non-visa holders (Article 5), in response to practical needs and in order to align the text with Article 12 of the Visa Code. Creating separate lanes for certain travellers : the proposal foresees the possibility to create separate lanes for visa-free travellers (Article 9) in order to provide additional flexibility and speed up border control in accordance with practical needs. Stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals : the situation of train crews on international connections is comparable to pilots or seamen as these trains follow a fixed schedule. The Commission already announced that it would introduce an exemption from stamping for this category of persons. Border guard training : the proposal provides measures to improve training of border guards in order to detect situations of particular vulnerability involving unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking (Article 15). Rescue services : in order to allow for derogations related to the entry and exit of members of rescue services, police and fire brigades acting in emergency situations an express legal framework is required (addition of a new category in Article 19, accompanied by related provisions in Annex VII) including the possibility to conclude bilateral agreements on this issue. In addition, a special exemption is made for offshore workers (such as workers on oil-platforms or on maritime windparks) in Annex VII, point 8, providing for rules comparable to coastal fishing. Checks within the territory : many Member States do not implement Article 22 of the Schengen implementing Convention (reporting obligation for legally staying third-country nationals entering other Member States). Practical difficulties in verifying compliance with this general reporting obligation are broadly acknowledged and no convincing cost/benefit argument could be made to show that this rule has a significant impact on identifying illegally staying immigrants. The recent Commission report on the application of Title III (Internal Borders) of the Schengen Borders Code therefore proposed repealing Article 22 Schengen implementing Convention as well as the corresponding reference to it in Article 21(d) Schengen Borders Code. The proposed amendment does not affect the right of Member States to provide for targeted checks to fight illegal immigration in their territory. Delegated acts : in order to align the provisions of the Schengen Borders with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of additional measures governing surveillance as well as amendments to the annexes. Reporting obligations : alignment of reporting obligations, expressly obliging Member States to inform the Commission of all bilateral agreements authorised by the Schengen Borders Code. An explicit legal framework for joint border crossings (Annex VI) : in order to enable bilateral agreements to be concluded between Member States and neighbouring third countries on cooperation in border control with joint border crossing points, Annex VI of the Schengen Borders Code needs to be amended to expressly permit bilateral agreements for joint border checks on road traffic and to provide a legal framework on certain key issues, such as the situation of persons requesting international protection. Amendments to the Annexes : a number of technical amendments have been made to the Annexes. Repealing certain articles of the Convention : the rules relating to border checks have been harmonised by EU law. This affects the power of Member States to conclude treaties in this field. The conclusion of bilateral agreements between a Member State and a third country on border checks without specific permission to do so in the Schengen Borders Code would affect EU law within the meaning of Article 3(2) TFEU and Article 2(1) TFEU. Article 136 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement is incompatible with this principle. It should therefore be repealed It should be noted that throughout the text, a certain number of changes resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty are proposed (‘EU’ instead of ‘EC’). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
710EP7,"""""Structures for the management of the European satellite radio navigation programmes""""",0.719,0.89,0.877,0.645,0.424,0.867,0.877,0.343,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to bring the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 on the structures for the management of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes into line with those of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 on the further implementation of the European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to reflect the fact that the Galileo Joint Undertaking would cease activities on 31 December 2006, Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 as amended established the European GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Supervisory Authority. The Authority’s original role was defined in order to meet the requirements of the system provided for at that time for the concession for the management and financing of the Galileo programme’s deployment and operational phases. This system was discontinued in 2007, and responsibility for the management and financing of the deployment phase of the programme will no longer lie with the private sector. Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, which entered into force on 25 July 2008, defines the new framework for the public governance and financing of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. It sets out the principle of the strict division of responsibilities between the European Community, represented by the Commission, the Authority and the European Space Agency, granting the Commission responsibility for the management of the programmes and setting out precisely the tasks given at that time to the Authority. It also provides that the Authority will accomplish such tasks entrusted to it whilst respecting the Commission’s role as manager of the programmes and in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission. Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 therefore implicitly and substantially amended Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004. It is now important to bring certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 into line with those of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 for the following reasons: the current situation, characterised by the coexistence of two texts which contradict each other in places, is unsatisfactory from a legal point of view; Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 stipulates that the Commission is to manage all questions relating to the security of the systems, but also makes the Supervisory Authority responsible for ensuring security accreditation. The precise role of the Authority in this regard therefore needs to be quickly clarified;  although Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 amended the Supervisory Authority’s responsibilities, it had no impact on its internal organisation, and the Commission’s influence in this area continues to be very limited. It is necessary to make changes to increase the Commission’s influence within the Authority’s internal organisation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the only logical option is to bring the text of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 into line with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 638/2008. Leaving the text of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 unchanged would not be satisfactory from a legal point of view, would cause major security problems and would not ensure the good governance of these programmes. CONTENT: the proposal aims to: amend the aim and objective, tasks and name of the Community agency established under Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004, so as to reflect the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008;  increase the role and the powers of the Commission within this agency in order to ensure that, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, the agency performs its task whilst respecting the Commission's role as manager and in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Commission;  set up a framework within which the agency assumes the responsibility for providing security accreditations, which it has been entrusted with, and to this end, to set up, within the agency, a committee for European GNSS systems’ security accreditations;  remove the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 on the ownership of systems, once the EC becomes owner of these systems in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the provisions of Directive 2009/39/EC were originally adopted in 1977. After several amendments, a recast version was adopted in 2009 to include the rules of the new Comitology procedure. The main objective of the Framework Directive was to remove the differences between national laws relating to foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses, thus allowing their free movement and creating fair conditions of competitions. Discussions with Member States and stakeholders have highlighted increasing difficulties for implementing the Framework Directive, in particular in relation to more recent pieces of Union legislation such as the legislation on food supplements, on the addition of vitamins and minerals and other substances to foods and nutrition and health claims. This unclear situation has led also to distortions of trade in the internal market. As foreseen in the Framework Directive, Member States were asked for their views and experience on the implementation of certain provisions of that Directive in order to prepare Commission reports on: (i) the implementation of the notification procedure of the Framework Directive on dietetic foods; (ii) the desirability of special provisions for foods for persons suffering from carbohydrate-metabolism disorders (diabetic foods). As regards foods for diabetic people, the Commission's report concludes that there is no scientific basis on which to develop specific compositional requirements for this category of food and that diabetic people should eat as healthily as possible choosing a diet from a variety of food for normal consumption. Also, the report on the implementation of the notification procedure points out that the category of food regulated under that provision differs significantly between Member States creating as a result market distortions. All abovementioned issues led to the need to consider an in-depth and global revision of the legislation on dietetic foods. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: f our options were assessed taking into account their economic, social and environmental impacts on the various stakeholders and authorities: Option 1 – Repeal all the legislation on dietetic foods (Framework Directive and all the specific Directives adopted under that Framework). Option 2 – Repeal the Framework Directive on dietetic foods but maintain certain of the specific rules adopted under that Framework. Option 3 – Revision of the Framework Directive establishing a positive list of dietetic foods with specific compositional and/or labelling rules. Option 4 – Amending the Framework Directive replacing the notification procedure with a centralised Union prior-authorisation procedure based on a scientific assessment. The Commission proposal follows option 2 - Repeal the Framework Directive on dietetic foods but maintain certain of the specific rules adopted under that Framework. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This Article provides that measures having as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market and which concern inter alia health, safety and consumer protection must takeas a base a high level of protection taking account in particular of any new development based on scientific facts. CONTENT: the proposal revises the legislation on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses covered by Directive 2009/39/EC the so-called ""Framework Directive on dietetic foods"". The proposal abolishes the concept of dietetic foods and provides for a new framework establishing general provisions only for a limited number of well-established and defined categories of food that are considered as essential for certain vulnerable groups of the population, i.e. food intended for infants and young children and food for patients under medical supervision. The proposal provides the basis for the assurance of a high level of consumer protection in relation to foods intended for infants and young children and to foods for special medical purposes. It establishes also a single legal measure that regulates the list of substances that can be added to the foods covered by the proposal (Chapter I). Chapters II and III provide for general principles and specific provisions that shall apply to infant formulae and follow-on formulae, processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children and foods for special medical purposes. Chapter IV relates to the establishment of a Union list of substances that can be added to the foods covered by the proposal and provides for a procedure for updating the Union list. Chapter V provides for a general confidentiality clause. Chapter VI and VII concerns all the procedural provisions related to the implementation of the new proposal, the delegation of powers, the procedures, the necessary amendments and the measures that are to be repealed. It specifies also the transitional measures that would apply to the categories of foods currently regulated under Directive 2009/39/EC and the date of entry into force and application. The proposal simplifies and clarifies legal requirements applying to certain categories of foods and establishes a single list of substances that may be added to the foods ('Union list') covered by this proposal. In particular, it: provides a new general Framework legislation applying to well-defined categories of foods that have been identified as essential for certain well-established groups of consumers with specific nutritional needs; establishes a clear and defined scope of application; maintains specific measures for categories of foods that are essential for certain groups of the population; lays down general rules as regards the composition and labelling applying to these categories of foods; removes differences in interpretation and difficulties for Member States and operators in applying different pieces of food legislation by simplifying the regulatory environment; removes the burdens associated with the notification procedure; ensures that similar products are treated in the same way across the Union; removes rules that have become unnecessary, contradictory and potentially conflicting. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions giving the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as regards the specific compositional and information requirements."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), on the one hand, and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts), on the other. In the context of the alignment of Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 to the new rules of the TFEU, powers currently conferred to the Commission by that Regulation have been reclassified into measures of delegated nature and measures of implementing nature. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to identify the delegated powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 and to establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts.

9256EP8,"""""Service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters""""",0.757,0.792,0.84,0.854,0.231,0.866,0.78,0.635,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve and expedite the transmission and service between the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2008, Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service of documents provides for fast-track channels and uniform procedures for transmitting documents from one Member State to another. Together with Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation in the taking of evidence, it is a crucial instrument in the regulation of judicial assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Member States. In 2018, approximately 3.4 million civil and commercial court proceedings in the EU have cross-border implications. In most of these cases (namely in those where at least one party resides in another Member State than the one where the proceedings takes place), courts often apply the Regulation on service of documents several times in the course of the proceedings. This is because additional documents often have to be served formally (such as the decisions closing the proceedings), in addition to the document instituting the proceedings. In 2017, to support the analysis of the practical application of the Regulation, the Commission undertook a regulatory fitness (REFIT) evaluation, On the traditional channel of transmission of a document to another Member State for purposes of service there - transmission through the so-called transmitting and receiving agencies - the evaluation revealed that this workflow is underperforming in that it still works more slowly and less efficiently than expected. The deadlines proposed in the Regulation are regularly exceeded and modern channels of communication are in practice not used. The evaluation also concluded that as regards the alternative methods of transmission and service of documents providing direct channels to serve documents in the territory of other Member States, the evaluation concluded that although they provide smoother solutions to assist cross-border judicial proceedings, there are ways in which they could be improved : service by post under the Regulation is a popular, quick and relatively cheap way of delivering the document to the addressee, but it is not very reliable and has a high failure rate. The so-called direct service provides a reliable solution but access to it is limited. This proposal is closely linked to the proposal amending the Regulation on the taking of evidence. The two proposals are presented together by the Commission, and constitute a package for the modernisation of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: as part of the preferred package, the effectiveness of the current regulation would be improved, mainly by reducing costs and delays. In particular, the impact assessment identified two changes that should be useful: mandatory electronic communication between the agencies and the facilitation of electronic and direct service. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 sets up a framework of judicial cooperation aligned with the digital single market strategy. It will help improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border proceedings by reducing the time spent on sending documents between agencies and by reducing reliance on paper-based communication. Specifically, the proposal: provides that the communication and exchange of documents between sending and receiving authorities is carried electronically, through a decentralised IT system made up of national IT systems interconnected by a secure and reliable communication infrastructure; ensures that alternative (traditional) means of communication are used in cases of unforeseen and exceptional disruption of the IT system; requires Member States to provide assistance in locating the whereabouts of a recipient in another Member State if the initiator of the service of the document either does not have any such information (‘whereabouts unknown’) or if the information at his/her disposal turns out to be incorrect; improves the procedure on the right of the addressee to refuse to accept the document if it is not drawn up or translated into an appropriate language; obliges the postal service providers to use a specific return slip (acknowledgement of receipt) when serving documents by post under the Regulation; introduces a minimum standard concerning persons to be regarded as eligible ‘substituting recipients’ if the postal service provider cannot hand over the document on the addressee in person; introduces a new measure to facilitate access to the direct service of documents, by extending the scope of application of the Regulation. Allowing direct service both for (i) transmitting agencies or (ii) the courts seised with the proceedings in the Member State of origin and in the territory of all Member States would lead to more direct and speedy transmission of documents compared to the baseline; introduces the electronic service of documents as an additional alternative method of service under the Regulation; requires the court seised with the proceedings to send an alert message about the initiation of the proceedings or about the default judgment to the available user account of the defendant in absentia and sets the time period for the availability of the extraordinary review to two years as of the issuance of the default judgment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not impose significant costs on national administrations, but rather lead to savings. The main costs for Member States will come from the implementation of electronic communication as mandatory for transmitting and receiving agencies. The main EU funding opportunities under the current financial programmes are the Justice programme and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package for the digital transformation priority, as unveiled on 2 May 2018, includes EUR 3 billion for a digital strand of the CEF, to finance digital connectivity infrastructure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. The negotiations have been concluded and the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA States (comprising Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland (BLMNS) and South Africa). The negotiations were completed at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 15 July 2014 in Pretoria. The Agreement was initialled on 15 July 2014 in Pretoria. It should be noted that: The SADC EPA will provide a uniform access regime for the BLMNS countries. For South Africa, the SADC EPA will replace the relevant provisions of Titles II and III of the TDCA, dealing respectively with trade and trade related issues. It is now necessary to conclude this Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Council is called upon to adopt a Decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union and its Member States, the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA States, of the other part. Scope and purpose of the Agreement: the Agreement contains provisions on: The Agreement also contains rendez-vous clauses on trade in services and investment, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and public procurement. Trade provisions: the SADC EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement. It offers asymmetric market access to the SADC EPA States, which allows them to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation; it provides a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection; it contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate exports; and it eliminates the use of export subsidies in trade between the Parties. The EPA guarantees duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market for Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Swaziland, with the exception of arms and ammunition. South Africa will benefit from new market access additional to the TDCA, that currently governs its trade relations with the EU. The EU will obtain meaningful new market access into the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and will have the security of a bilateral agreement with Mozambique, one of the LDCs in the region. The EPA is designed to be compatible with the operation of SACU, in particular by fully harmonising SACU's import trade regime. SACU presents a single external schedule of tariffs and quota arrangements applied to imports from the EU. The SADC EPA also contains a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development that links the trade agreement to EU objectives in the field of labour, environment, and climate change. Institutional provisions and monitoring: the Parties undertake to continuously monitor the operation and impact of this Agreement. The institutional provisions establish a Joint Council at Ministerial level to be responsible for the operation and implementation of the Agreement and to monitor the fulfilment of its objectives. The Joint Council shall be assisted by a Trade and Development Committee. Furthermore, the Agreement: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is without budgetary implications on Union expenditure but will have a budgetary impact on the revenue side. Thus, foregone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 33.3 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years. This estimate is based on the average volume of imports over the period 2012-2014. With the exception of a number of products imported from South Africa, imports from the SADC EPA Group already enter the European Union duty free."

Colombia and Peru were, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the Commission could present to the Council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. In October 2014, the Commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of Peru. The Commission concluded that the significant improvement of the Peruvian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that Peruvians should be granted visa-free access to the Member States' territory. In addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the Union. In March 2015, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with Colombia and Peru. On 19 May 2015, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations with Peru were opened on 20 May 2015 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 June 2015. The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Peru on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Peru when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Peru may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Peru to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Peru remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Biometric passports: the Agreement includes a number of declarations: Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Peru to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

7999EP9,"""""Digital Green Certificate - Union citizens""""",0.613,0.929,0.757,0.342,0.246,0.935,0.799,0.341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates on vaccination, testing and recovery to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic (Digital Green Certificate). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. To ensure a well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement, the Council adopted, on 13 October 2020, Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Member States have launched or plan to launch initiatives to issue vaccination certificates. However, for these to be used effectively in a cross-border context when citizens exercise their free movement rights, such certificates need to be fully interoperable, secure and verifiable. A commonly agreed approach is required among Member States on the content, format, principles and technical standards of such certificates. In their declaration adopted following the informal video conferences on 25-26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for further work on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission is working with Member States in the e-Health network, a voluntary network of national e-Health authorities, to prepare for the interoperability of these certificates. Work is also underway to develop a common harmonised data set for COVID-19 test result certificates. CONTENT: based on the technical work done so far, the proposed Regulation establishes the digital green certificate, which is a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital green certificate The interoperable digital green certificate should allow for the issuance, cross-border verification and acceptance of any of the following certificates: (i) vaccination certificates, (ii) certificates for screening tests (NAAT/RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) and (iii) certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. Member States should issue the certificates in a digital and/or paper-based format. Certificates issued by Member States should contain an interoperable barcode to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The certificates should be available free of charge and in the official language(s) of the issuing Member State as well as in English. Trust framework The Commission and the Member States should establish a digital trust framework infrastructure allowing for the secure issuance and verification of certificates and ensuring, as far as possible, interoperability with internationally established technology systems. The proposal also provides for the acceptance of secure and verifiable certificates issued by third countries to EU citizens and their family members according to an international standard that is interoperable with the trust framework established by the Regulation and that will contain the necessary personal data, following an implementing decision by the Commission. Issuance, content and acceptance of certificates The proposal provides details on the issuance, content and acceptance of the vaccination certificate, the test certificate and the certificate of recovery. The certificates would include a limited set of essential information such as name, date of birth, date of issue, relevant information on the vaccine administered/tested/recovery and a unique certificate identifier. The digital green certificate would be valid in all EU Member States and open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The possession of a ‘digital green certificate’, in particular a vaccination certificate, should not be a precondition for the exercise of free movement. In particular, the proposed Regulation cannot be interpreted as establishing an obligation or right to be vaccinated. Notification The proposal establishes a notification procedure to ensure that the other Member States and the Commission are informed of the restrictions on the right to free movement made necessary by the pandemic. Data protection The certificates should contain only such personal data as is necessary. Given that the personal data includes sensitive medical data, a very high level of data protection should be ensured and data minimisation principles should be preserved. In particular, the ‘Digital Green Certificate’ framework should not require the setting up and maintenance of a database at EU level but should allow for the decentralised verification of digitally signed interoperable certificates. Temporary measure The proposal foresees that the measures should be suspended once the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency."
6863EP7,"""""Carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport""""",0.579,0.736,0.982,0.29,0.303,0.88,0.815,0.171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to monitor, report and verify carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the view of contributing to the EU 2020 Strategy, the 2011 Commission White Paper on Transport states that EU CO2 emissions from maritime transport should be reduced by 40% (if feasible 50%) from 2005 levels by 2050. In 2010 the total CO2 emissions related to European maritime transport activities (including intra EU routes, incoming voyages to the EU and outgoing voyages from the EU) were estimated to be of the order of 180 Mt CO2. Despite of the introduction of minimum energy efficiency standards for certain categories of new ships (""Energy Efficiency Design Index"", EEDI) by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2011, the emissions are expected to increase. The projected increase of CO2 emissions from shipping is not in line with the EU objectives , leading to negative impacts on climate change. Furthermore, at the EU level, international maritime transport remains the only transport mode not included in the EU's greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitment which requires additional efforts from all other sectors. Today, the precise amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions of EU-related maritime transport is not known due to the lack of monitoring and reporting of such emissions. Convinced of the need for a staged approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport, the Commission considers that a robust system for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport is a prerequisite for any market-based measure or efficiency standard, whether applied at EU level or globally. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the results of the impact assessment, the MRV only option would lead to more limited emission reductions estimated at up to 2% in 2030 (compared to the baseline) leading to cost reductions up to around EUR 1.2 billion in 2030. Costs of implementation are estimated at around EUR 26 million per year (when excluding ship below 5000 GT from the scope). Overall, the relative benefit/cost ratio of this option is very high. LEGAL BASIS: Article 162(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of the legislative proposal is to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from ships are monitored and reported, and therefore to improve the availability of information for policy and decision making in the context of the Union’s climate change commitments and provide incentives for mitigation efforts. To this effect, it is proposed to establish an EU MRV system for CO2 emission from ships as first step of a staged approach to reduce these emissions. The operational characteristics of the proposed MRV system are as follows: CO2 emissions from ships: the proposed measure focusses on CO2 emissions representing about 98% of the greenhouse gas emissions of the shipping sector and on large ships above 5000 Gross Tons (GT) which account for around 55% of the number of ships calling into Union ports and represent around 90% of the related emissions.. Minimise the administrative burden : the proposal aims to reduce the administrative burden as much as possible for ship owners and operators and provides to this effect that the annual calculation of CO2 emissions shall be based on fuel consumption and fuel type and energy efficiency using available data from log books, noon reports and bunker delivery notes. In addition, reporting and publication of reported information should be organised on an annual basis. Geographical scope : the following routes will in principle be covered in a non-discriminatory manner for all ships regardless their flag: intra-EU voyages; voyages from the last non-EU port to the first EU port of call (incoming voyages); voyages from an EU port to the next non-EU port of call (outgoing voyages). Verification of emission reports : the operational framework seeks the use of existing structures and bodies of the maritime sector, in particular recognised organisations to verify emission reports and to issue documents for compliance. Verification by accredited verifiers should ensure that monitoring plans and emission reports are correct and in compliance with the requirements defined by this Regulation. A document of compliance issued by an independent verifier will have to be carried on board ships and will be subject to inspection by Member State authorities. Towards a global system : given the Commission's clear preference for measures taken at global level, the EU MRV should serve as example for the implementation of a global MRV with the aim to speed up the international discussions. In this context, relevant submissions to the IMO will be made when appropriate. The proposal includes a provision allowing the Commission to review this Regulation in the context of future international developments, in particular in case of the introduction of a global MRV system through the IMO. In such an event the proposed Regulation should be reviewed and if appropriate amended to align the provisions on MRV with the international system. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Regulation will be implemented using the existing budget and will not have an impact on the multi-annual financial framework. Limited IT development costs for the necessary adjustment of an existing tool hosted and operated by EMSA of around EUR 0.5 million are expected. EMSA's involvement depends on the respective ancillary task of the agency to be activated and approved by the EMSA Board."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products and Council Regulation (EC) No 614/2009 on the common system of trade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin15 need to be adapted as a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in particular as regards its introduction of a distinction between powers for the Commission to adopt delegated acts and powers for it to adopt implementing acts. Further adaptations are needed to improve the clarity and transparency of the existing texts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there is no need for an impact assessment since the proposal to align Regulation No 1216/2009 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter of relevance to all Council Regulations and the alignment to the new Single CMO Regulation is a consequence of the new CAP after 2013 and the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposed Regulation (EU) of the Council and of the Parliament replacing the trade arrangements for Processed Agricultural Products/non-Annex I goods, currently laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products is: to identify, in Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009, the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission and establish the corresponding procedure for the adoption of these acts and this in parallel with the Lisbon alignment of the single Common Market Organisation; to adapt Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 to the new Single CMO Regulation in the context of the CAP after 2013 and the new MFF 2014-2020; to integrate the common system of trade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin (Regulation (EC) No 614/2009) in the trade regime for processed agricultural products (Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009). Ovalbumin and lactalbumin are processed agricultural products which are not included in Annex I to the Treaty. In view of the fact that to a large extent, eggs can be substituted by ovalbumin and, to a certain extent, by lactalbumin, the trade arrangements for ovalbumin and lactalbumin should correspond to those established for eggs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 of 19 November 2007 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part. The new proposed Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main provisions codified : the proposal lays down certain procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Montenegro, of the other part (‘SAA’). It stipulates that fishery products originating in Montenegro may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of those tariff quotas. Tariff quotas : the proposal sets out in particular: concessions for fish and fishery products certain tariff reductions. The proposal also lays down conditions as regards the safeguard clauses for agricultural and fishery products provided for in the Agreement as well as a general safeguard clause. The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the SAA requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard and other measures. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require. The proposal sets out conditions as regards the administrative cooperation to facilitate the management of the Agreement. It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 140/2008."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2018/1091 on integrated farm statistics requires Member States to carry out integrated farm surveys in 2020, 2023 and 2026. The Regulation contains a provision on the establishment of the budget for the collection of data for the surveys to be carried out in 2023 and 2026. It establishes the financial envelope for the entire duration of the relevant multiannual financial framework (MFF). In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1091, the amount of the Union contribution to integrated farm statistics under the MFF 2021-2027 should be fixed by the European Parliament and the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, once the MFF 2021-2027 has entered into force. The proposal is part of the strategy for agricultural statistics for 2020 and beyond, a major programme to modernise EU agricultural statistics produced by the European Commission in close cooperation with the Member States. It aims to ensure the quality and comparability of European agricultural statistics collected and compiled according to the same principles in all Member States. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the financing of integrated statistics on agricultural holdings for the period 2021-2027. It establishes a budget of EUR 40 million for the period 2021-2027 (of which EUR 36.4 million is for grants to national statistical institutes and other national authorities). The amount proposed for 2021-2027 should finance the farm structure surveys conducted in 2023 and 2026 only, including the costs related to the management, maintenance and development of the databases used by the Commission to process the data supplied by Member States. The EU's financial contribution for the grants should be provided by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU faces a security landscape in flux, with evolving and increasingly complex security threats. Criminals and terrorists exploit the advantages that the digital transformation and new technologies bring about, including the inter-connectivity and blurring of the boundaries between the physical and digital world. The COVID-19 crisis has added to this, as criminals have quickly seized opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modes of operation or developing new criminal activities. These threats spread across borders and manifest themselves in poly-criminal organised crime groups that engage in a wide range of criminal activities. As action at national level alone does not suffice to address these transnational security challenges, therefore the Commission proposes to enhance Europol’s mandate in order to give further support to Member States’ law enforcement authorities. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: this proposal aims to support and strengthen action by the Member States’ law enforcement services and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy. Specific provisions of the new mandate The new mandate should: - ensure effective cooperation between Europol and private parties: terrorists often abuse the services provided by private companies to recruit volunteers, to carry out terrorist attacks and to disseminate their propaganda. The revised mandate would allow private parties to refer such information directly to Europol. The Agency would be able to receive personal data directly from private parties and analyse it to identify all Member States concerned; request personal data from private parties (via the Member State where it is located); and act as a channel for Member States' requests to private parties, in compliance with data protection requirements; - enable Europol to exchange personal data with private parties related to crisis response: the proposal sets out rules for Europol to support Member States in preventing the large scale dissemination, via online platforms, of terrorist content related to on-going or recent real-world events depicting harm to life or physical integrity. Europol would be able to exchange personal data with private parties, including hashes, IP addresses or URLs related to such content; - allow Europol to analyse large datasets (‘big data') to support criminal investigations, considering that the processing of large data sets is an integral part of police work in today's digital world; - improve Europol's cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, including through analytical support to the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and information exchange, and with the European Anti-Fraud Office; - reinforce Europol's role in developing new technologies for law enforcement, helping to equip national law enforcement authorities with modern technologies to counter serious crime and terrorism; - strengthen Europol's data protection framework, accountability and democratic oversight, including by introducing new reporting obligations for Europol to the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group in charge of monitoring its activities. Budgetary implications The proposal would have an impact on the budget and staff needs of Europol. It is estimated that an additional budget of around EUR 180 million and around 160 additional posts would be needed for the overall MFF period to ensure that Europol has the necessary resources to enforce its revised mandate. This increase in staff and budget would give Europol the means to fulfil its strengthened mandate. It would provide the European Counter Terrorism Centre with adequate resources and to enable its EU Internet Referral Unit to monitor and refer all types of terrorist content to online platforms with a 24/7 availability. The revision of Europol's mandate also opens the possibility for Member States to contribute directly to Europol's budget, where necessary and required by existing or new tasks."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The principal objective of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and the Council is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Union. For that purpose, a system of certificates has been established for various aviation activities, in order to achieve the required safety levels and to enable the necessary verifications and the mutual acceptance of certificates issued. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement affects in particular the validity of certificates and licenses originating from the United Kingdom issued under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139. The Commission proposes therefore to set up a temporary mechanism, to extend the validity of certain aviation safety certificates, in order to allow the operators concerned and the Agency sufficient time to issue the necessary certificates under Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, taking account of the United Kingdom's status as a third country. CONTENT: the proposal aims to put in place a mechanism to temporarily extend (for 9 months) the validity of certain aviation safety certificates in the absence of an agreement to withdraw the United Kingdom from the Union. It would thus allow post-Brexit EU-27 manufacturers to continue their production and operators to continue to use these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. This Regulation shall apply to the certificates listed in the Annex to this Regulation, which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by any of the following: - the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom as set out in Section 1 of the Annex; - natural or legal persons certified by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom as set out in Section 2 of the Annex. The Commission shall have the power to adopt delegated acts in order to extend the period of validity of the certificates referred to in Section 1 of the Annex to the Regulation. Lastly, the content and exams of certain trainings addressed under the proposal are regulated in a detailed manner under Union law and consist of standardised modules, which should normally be completed in one Member State, before a transfer to another Member State jurisdiction is possible."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Directive 2012/34/EU. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its White Paper on transport policy of 28 March 2011, the Commission announced its intention to complete the internal railway market, allowing railway undertakings of the Union to provide all types of rail transport services without unnecessary technical and administrative barriers. In the last decade, three legislative ‘railway packages’ have aimed at opening up national markets and making railways more competitive and interoperable at EU level. Despite the new EU legislation, the modal share (6%) of rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. A number of problems need to be addressed: - the difficulty in accessing national passenger transport services: in many Member States, the market for domestic passenger services is closed to competition, which limits their development. This also creates disparities between those Member States that have opened their markets, and those that have not; - the governance of infrastructure managers: since infrastructure managers are natural monopolies, they do not always react to the needs of the market and its users; - a number of market entry barriers result from situations where infrastructure management and transport operations are part of the same integrated structure, with infrastructure managers facing a conflict of interest; - lastly, integrated structures make it much more difficult to enforce the separation of accounts between infrastructure management and transport operations. This proposal to amend Directive 2012/34/EU forms part of the Fourth Railway Package the overall objective of which is to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing any remaining legal, institutional and technical obstacles, and fostering the performance of the railway sector and its competitiveness, in order to further develop the Single European Railway Area. IMPACT ANALYSIS: based on an external study and the conclusions of a targeted consultation, the Commission carried out an impact assessment of the proposed measures, which examined options for new measures aiming to modernise the existing regulatory framework. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal encompasses provisions with the following aims: 1. The opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail with the objective of intensifying competitive pressure on domestic rail markets. The Commission proposes to open, from December 2019, all national passenger transport routes to new entrants and service providers. 2. Enhancing governance of the infrastructure manager with the objective of ensuring equal access to the infrastructure. To this end, the proposal seeks to: - remove conflicts of interest affecting decisions of the infrastructure manager on market access and eliminate the potential for cross-subsidisation, which exists in integrated structures; - ensure that all of the infrastructure manager’s functions will be managed in a consistent manner; - strengthen coordination between infrastructure managers and rail operators to better respond to market needs; - create a forum for the cooperation of infrastructure managers across borders; - establish information and integrated ticketing schemes common to all railway undertakings operating domestic passenger services in a way that does not distort competition. The proposal allows vertically integrated undertakings, including those with a holding structure, to maintain ownership of the infrastructure manager on condition that there are strong and efficient safeguards protecting the infrastructure manager’s independence. Verification of compliance: Member States could limit access rights of railway operators which are part of vertically integrated undertakings, where the Commission is not in a position to confirm that safeguards to protect the independence of the infrastructure manager have been effectively implemented. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the recommendations presented in February 2009 of a group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009 (COM(2009)0114). The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 (COM(2009)0252) which proposed the establishment of : a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees into a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), thereby combining the advantages of an overarching European framework for financial supervision with the expertise of local micro-prudential supervisory bodies that are closest to the institutions operating in their jurisdictions; and a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. To this end, the ESRB would provide an early warning of system-wide risks that may be building up and, where necessary, issue recommendations for action to deal with these risks. The European Council, in its conclusions of 19 June 2009, recommended that a European System of Financial Supervisors, comprising three new European Supervisory Authorities, be established. The system should be aimed at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision, strengthening oversight of cross border groups and establishing a European single rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to proposals on: a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanies these proposals, examining the options in more detail (see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: in order to take account of sectoral specificities, three separate Regulations are needed to establish the Authorities for banking, insurance and occupational pensions, and securities. The broad thrust of these proposals is, however, identical. The proposal discusses the common elements and briefly touches upon the differences between the three Regulations. Objectives of the ESAs : these shall be to contribute to: (i) improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular a high, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision, (ii) protecting depositors, investors, policyholders and other beneficiaries, (iii) ensuring the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, (iv) safeguarding the stability of the financial system, and (v) strengthening international supervisory coordination. The ESAs will be Community bodies with a legal personality and a key element of the proposed ESFS. The latter shall function as a network of supervisors and comprise the national authorities in the Member States, a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities, to cover cross-sectoral issues, and the European Commission. While the ESAs should enjoy maximum independence to objectively fulfil their mission, the Commission has to be involved where institutional reasons and the responsibilities under the Treaty so require. The main decision-making body of each ESA will be its Board of Supervisors, consisting of the heads of the relevant national supervisors as well as the Chairperson of the respective Authority. The Chairperson will preside over meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Management Board. The day-to-day management of each Authority will be in the hands of an Executive Director. Tasks and powers: the ESAs will take on all the tasks of the existing European supervisory committees, but also have significantly increased responsibilities, defined legal powers and greater authority. Develop technical standards : a single EU rule book should be established, applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. To this end, differences in the national transposition of Community law stemming from exceptions, derogations, additions or ambiguities must be removed, so that one harmonised core set of standards can be defined and applied. To contribute to this, the Authorities will develop draft technical standards. These standards constitute an effective instrument to strengthen Level 3 of the Lamfalussy structure, which currently is limited to the adoption of non-binding guidelines. Powers to ensure the consistent application of Community rules : a mechanism will be put in place to address behaviour by national supervisory authorities who are considered to be diverging from the existing Community legislation (including technical standards). The proposal describes the steps of the mechanism. Action in emergency situations : whilst ESAs will have a coordination role between national supervisory authorities, in some emergency situations coordination may not be sufficient, notably when national supervisors alone lack the tools to respond rapidly to an emerging cross-border crisis. The ESAs should thereforehave the power to require national supervisors to take specific action jointly. The determination of a cross-border emergency situation will be left to the Commission. This is subject to the safeguard clause. Settlement of disagreements between national supervisory authorities : a mechanism is proposed to ensure that relevant national supervisory authorities take due account of the interests of other Member States, including within colleges of supervisors. This mechanism consists of three possible steps which are set out in the text. Colleges of supervisors : the latter are central to the EU supervisory system and play an important role in ensuring a balanced flow of information between home and host authorities. The ESAs will contribute to promoting the efficient and consistent functioning of colleges of supervisors and may participate as observers in colleges of supervisors and receive all relevant information shared between the members of the college. Common supervisory culture: the ESAs shall play an active role in building a common European supervisory culture and ensuring uniform procedures and consistent supervisory practices throughout the Community. The common supervisory culture may increasingly create opportunities for supervisors to delegate certain tasks to one another. The ESAs shall periodically conduct peer review analysis of national supervisory authorities. Assessment of market developments : although the proposed ESRB will be responsible for macro-prudential analysis of the EU financial sector, the ESAs should continue the work of the existing European supervisory committees in this area as: (i) the focus of their analysis is different, i.e., micro-prudential analysis provides a bottom-up analysis, rather than macro-prudential analysis which is top-down, and (ii) their analysis may serve as helpful input into the work carried-out by the ESRB. International role : through these proposals the Commission is responding to the weaknesses identified during the crisis as well as to the G20 call to take action to build a stronger, more globally consistent, regulatory and supervisory system for financial services. The ESAs could serve as helpful contact points for supervisory authorities from third countries. They may enter into administrative arrangements with administrations of third countries and may also assist in preparing equivalence decisions pertaining to supervisory regimes in third countries. They may provide advice to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission or publish opinions, including with respect to the prudential assessments of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Collection of information : at the request of the Authority, supervisory authorities and other public authorities of the Member States shall provide the Authority with all the necessary information to carry out the duties assigned to it by this Regulation. In principle, all information should be transferred to the ESAs by the national supervisory authorities. Relationship with the ESRB: the framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate closely. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB would need a timely flow of micro-prudential information, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities would benefit from the ESRB’s insights on the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more national supervisory authorities. Safeguard: in view of the fact that decisions by the ESAs should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States, a safeguard clause is introduced which ensures that, where a Member State considers that a decision taken under provisions concerning emergency decisions or settlement of disagreements of these Regulations impinges on its fiscal responsibility, it may notify the Authority and the Commission that the national supervisory authority does not intend to implement the Authority's decision, clearly demonstrating how the decision by the Authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities. Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities : a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities will ensure mutual understanding, cooperation and consistent supervisory approaches between the three new ESAs. Board of Appeal : an appeal system will ensure that any person, including national supervisory authorities, may in first instance appeal to a Board of Appeal against a decision by the ESAs to ensure the coherent application of Community rules, action in emergency situations, and the settlement of disagreements. The Board of Appeal shall be a joint body of three ESAs, i.e., it will deal with issues related to banking, insurance and securities. Key differences between the three Regulations : the main differences between the three proposed Regulations concern the objectives of the Authorities, the scope of action, and the definitions, which are adapted to the specificities of the relevant sector and existing Community legislation. Moreover, the European Council concluded that the ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. ESMA would be responsible to register credit rating agencies. ESMA would also be empowered to take supervisory measures such as withdrawing the registration or suspending the use for regulatory purposes of credit ratings. Supervisory powers could include the power to request information and to conduct investigations or on-site inspections. The responsibilities and powers of ESMA with regard to credit rating agencies will be defined in an amendment to the Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: for the transformation of the existing European supervisory committees into effective ESAs, enhanced resources are needed - both personnel and budgetary. For the EIOPA, the total operational expenditure from the Community budget in commitment and payment appropriations for the years 2011-2013 is EUR 16.984 million. In addition, Member States (national supervisory authorities or ministries of finance) will contribute EUR 25.476 million over the three year period. This gives a total of EUR 42.459 from 2011 to 2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress has been made in the International Civil Aviation Organisation towards the adoption at the 2013 ICAO Assembly of a framework facilitating States' application of market-based measures to emissions from international aviation, and on developing a global market-based measure. In order to facilitate this progress and provide momentum, it is desirable to defer enforcement of requirements relating to flights to and from aerodromes outside the Union and areas with close economic connections to the Union and a shared commitment to tackle climate change arising prior to the 2013 ICAO Assembly. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal for a Decision seeks to enhance the chances of a successful outcome of the 2013 ICAO Assembly in terms of developing a global market-based measure (MBM) and adopting a framework facilitating States' application of market-based measures to international aviation. The Decision would ""stop the clock,"" by temporarily deferring enforcement of the obligations of aircraft operators in respect of incoming and outgoing flights under the European Union's Emission Trading System (ETS). Action should therefore not be taken against aircraft operators in respect of requirements resulting from Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community arising before 1 January 2014 as regards incoming and outgoing flights. The condition for this is that they have either not received, or have returned, 2012 free allocations granted for such activities to or from aerodromes outside the EU and closely connected areas with a shared commitment to tackle climate change. Proper monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions from such flights is welcomed, but no compliance sanctions will be applied in respect of the non-reporting of such emissions. Directive 2003/87/EC continues to apply in full in respect of flights between aerodromes in the EU and closely connected areas with a shared commitment to tackle climate change. To provide further momentum to the international discussions and continue EU leadership in this process, the Commission considers it is important that this proposal is agreed between the European Parliament and Council swiftly and ideally by March 2013. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."
2602EP7,"""""Common commercial policy""""",0.825,0.905,0.018,0.581,0.242,0.843,0.897,0.6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"reflect the changes in the legal framework and institutional balance brought about by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. CONTENT: a number of basic regulations relating to the common commercial policy provide that acts implementing the common commercial policy are to be adopted by the Council according to procedures set down in the various instruments concerned or by the Commission subject to specific procedures and control by the Council. Such procedures are not subject to Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (comitology). It is appropriate to amend those regulations in order to ensure consistency with the provisions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon which has led to significant changes both in the framework for the adoption of delegated and implementing acts and for the conduct of trade policy. This should be done, where appropriate, through the granting of delegated powers to the Commission and by applying certain procedures set out in Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States. One of the key objectives of the abovementioned regulation, proposed by the Commission in March 2009, is to provide that the control of the Commission's exercise of its implementing powers is conducted not by the Council or the European Parliament but by the Member States as is required by Article 291 of the Treaty. In the proposal, this is achieved by the creation of procedures (the advisory and examination procedures) whereby the Commission's implementing acts are subject to control by the Member States combined with an automatic alignment of existing procedures established under Council Decision 1999/468/EC. The current proposal addresses procedures for the control or adoption of acts in twenty four basic acts in the field of the common commercial policy not previously subject to Council Decision 1999/468/EC. Aligning the control of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers on the Regulation on the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers will bring additional advantages. In particular, it will permit a more effective and efficient exercise of the Commission's implementing powers and so contribute to a more effective and efficient common commercial policy.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the EU, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: air services between the European Union and Jordan presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Jordan. The conclusion of a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement with Jordan has been a priority for the EU and is an important element in the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The negotiating mandate received from the Council in June 2007 set the objective of establishing a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the EU and Jordan. This would extend the rules and provisions of the single market for air transport in the EU to a large extent to Jordan in which European and Jordanian air carriers would be able to provide air services without any restriction. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, a draft Agreement with Jordan was initialled by the two sides on 17 March 2010. LEGAL BASE: Article 207 (5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2), (5), (6) and (7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a report prepared for the Commission in 2008 by consultants, estimated that an Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement with Jordan would generate 54,000 extra passengers and consumer benefits of up to EUR 30 million in the first effective year of market opening. CONTENT: the Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the EU and its Member States, and Jordan has been negotiated under a mandate. By establishing a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Area, the Agreement will extend EU legislation in the field of aviation to Jordan. In particular, Jordan will take over EU legislation in important fields such as safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement will replace the existing arrangements made by individual Member States. It creates simultaneously for all Union air carriers uniform conditions for market access, and establishes new arrangements for regulatory co-operation between the EU and Jordan in fields essential for the safe, secure, and efficient operation of air services. These arrangements can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. The Agreement allows for the simultaneous extension of its terms to the 27 Member States, applying the same rules without discrimination and benefiting all Union air carriers regardless of their nationality. These carriers can now operate freely from any point in the EU to any point in Jordan which is currently not the case. Removal of all market access restrictions between the EU and Jordan will not only attract new entrants to the market and create opportunities to operate to underserved airports, but will also facilitate consolidation between EU air carriers. The Agreement secures for all EU air carriers access to commercial opportunities, such as the possibility of freely establishing prices. One further objective of the mandate is to create a level playing field between all EU and Jordanian air carriers, and this requires strong regulatory co-operation which can only be delivered at Union level. The Agreement aims at: gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators based on the principles of the EU Treaties; alignment of the Jordanian aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management; the possibility of extending the Agreement in order to create with all the other Mediterranean Partners a Common Euro Mediterranean Aviation Area. The Agreement consists of the main body including the main principles, and three annexes: Annex 1 on traffic rights, Annex 2 on transitional provisions and Annex 3 including the EU aviation legislation to be taken over by Jordan. Lastly, it establishes a Joint Committee which will be responsible for reviewing the implementation of the Agreement and its effects. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for bananas in the EU (EU) has traditionally provided a preferential trade regime in favour of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-exporting countries. For several ACP states, banana production for export to the EU forms an important economic activity with multiplier effects for the rest of the economy. The EU's banana CMO has been challenged since 1995 through the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Dispute Settlement Mechanism, whose Appellate Body decisions have repeatedly ruled against it. Consequently, the EU has negotiated a trade agreement on bananas within the framework of the WTO. This supports the completion of the Doha Development Agenda's (DDA) agricultural modalities and the full Doha Round. Implementation of this agreement will lead to the reduction of the ACPs' preference margin. In order to promote the gradual integration of banana-exporting ACP countries into the global economy, the EU has provided assistance to the banana sectors of a number of countries through the Special System of Assistance (SSA, 1994-1999) and the Special Framework of Assistance (SFA, 1999-2008). The SFA operated in 12 banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The SFA operated in twelve banana-exporting ACP countries and expired in December 2008. The external evaluation of the SFA highlights positive results, as stated in the draft Communication on the Biennial Report on the Special Framework of Assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas. Certain countries managed to enhance competitiveness, as reflected in ACP bananas' stable export volumes and EU market share (see COM(2010)0103). However, production costs in ACP countries generally remain higher than in Most Favoured Nation (MFN) countries. The results of measures to support diversification are less visible and will require more efforts. A reduction in tariff preferences for ACP banana-supplying countries will lead to additional adjustment requirements, building on the adaptation and restructuring processes underway. In view of these challenges, the Commission proposes to create an ACP Banana Accompanying Measures programme for the main ACP banana-supplying countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 (“DCI instrument.) The Banana Accompanying Measures to be adopted aim at: enhancing the competitiveness of the banana export sector, where this is sustainable, taking into account the situation of different stakeholders in the chain; promoting the economic diversification of banana-dependent areas; addressing broader impacts generated by the adaptation process, possibly related but not restricted to employment and social services, land use and environmental restoration, and macroeconomic stability. They will take into account the results of and experiences gained through the SSA and the SFA. The Banana Accompanying Measures are proposed as a temporary programme with a maximum duration of four years (2010-2013). The main ACP banana supplying countries are: Belize, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname. The budget for the measures is EUR 190 million. Within this amount, the Commission will fix the maximum amount available to each eligible ACP banana-supplying country for financing the actions above on the basis of a set of objective indicators. The indicators shall include trade in bananas with the EU; the importance of banana exports to the economy in the ACP country concerned; and country's level of development. The measurement of the allocation criteria shall be based on data from years preceding 2009. The Commission will adopt multi-annual support strategies and ensure that such strategies complement the geographic strategy papers of the countries concerned, and the temporary nature of these banana accompanying measures. The support strategies may be reviewed ad hoc, if necessary, but shall not be submitted to a mid-term review. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budget is EUR 190 million. The programme will be financed through appropriations under the expenditure of Heading 4 (""The EU as a Global Player""). It is proposed to use part of the available margin under this heading for EUR 75.9 million. Commission services have assessed the availability of funds over the period 2010-2013 in order to ascertain redeployment possibilities because of potential underutilisation, absorption constraints and/or political circumstances. The analysis leads to a proposed redeployment of EUR 95.8 million under Heading 4. For the remainder (EUR 18.3 million) the Commission proposes the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument. Lastly, it should be noted that the total financial reference amount for the implementation of the DCI Regulation over the period 2007-2013 is now EUR 17 087 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: while emissions from other sectors are generally falling, road transport is one of the few sectors where emissions have risen rapidly. Between 1990 and 2008 emissions from road transport increased by 26%. As a result, it is the second biggest source of GHG emissions in the EU, and contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of CO2. In March 2011 the Commission adopted the 'Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system'. It sets out a transport strategy within a frame of achieving a 60% reduction in transport GHG emissions by 2050. Regulation (EC) 443/2009 sets the CO2 reduction framework for the new car fleet to 2020. It provides an operation in two parts. In the first period to 2015 the modalities of compliance with the target have been established. For the second period to 2020 the target cannot become effective without implementing the necessary modalities, which are to be determined in a review. This target was established in the co-decision process and is not reconsidered in the review. Failure to determine or implement the modalities would have a detrimental effect on vehicle manufacturers and parts suppliers who need certainty with regard to the technology and vehicles that will be needed to meet the target. Key modalities in the current Regulation include the limit value curve which is defined by the utility parameter and the function describing the relationship between the utility parameter and CO2 emissions (setting the shape and slope). Other modalities include the excess emissions premium scheme, eco-innovations, derogations, pooling, the phasing-in of the targets and granting of super-credits for a limited period of time. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a joint impact assessment supporting the current proposal and a proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 510/2011  has been prepared. The following aspects were analysed: (a) 'do nothing' option; (b) modalities of meeting the car target; (c) simplification and reduction of administrative burden; (d) adaptation to the new test cycle; (e) form and stringency of legislation beyond 2020. Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends the Regulation to implement the modalities of meeting the 95 gCO2/km target for new passenger cars to be reached in 2020. The main modalities implemented are as follows: · the utility parameter continues to be the vehicle's mass in running order; · the limit value curve remains linear with a slope of 60% compared to the baseline fleet which is kept as the 2006 fleet in line with the 2015 limit value curve; · super-credits for cars emitting below 35 gCO2/km are introduced between 2020 and 2023 with a multiplier of 1.3 and limited to a cumulative figure of 20 000 vehicles per manufacturers over the duration of the scheme; · the ""niche"" derogation for manufacturers target is updated for 2020; · manufacturers responsible for less than 500 registrations of new passenger cars per year are excluded from the obligation of having a CO2 target; · more flexibility is allowed in the timing of decisions granting small volume derogations; · eco-innovations are retained when a revised test procedure is implemented; · the Excess Emissions Premium is maintained at €95 per g/km per vehicle; · the Committee procedure provisions are updated to be compatible with the Lisbon Treaty. As industry benefits from indications of the regulatory regime that would apply beyond 2020, the proposal includes a further review to take place by 31 December 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
2450EP7,"""""European Maritime Safety Agency""""",0.035,0.828,0.825,0.194,0.242,0.867,0.862,0.286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation 1406/2002 by clarifying the European Maritime Safety Agency's (EMSA) existing tasks and role as well as by extending EMSA's tasks to new areas under development at international and/or EU level. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: following the accident of the oil tanker ""Erika"" and the major oil pollution caused by this accident, the Commission set up the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) as a technical body with the aim to ensure a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships in the EU. Today, EMSA provides Member States and the Commission with technical and scientific assistance in order to help Member States to apply properly the Community legislation in the field of maritime safety, maritime security and prevention of pollution by ships, to monitor the implementation of this legislation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in place and assist in the development of new measures. The previous modifications made to regulation 1406/2002 have not been sufficient to address the new challenges ahead for EMSA, most of the challenges being external either to EMSA only or to EMSA and the EU as a whole. Based on the findings of the external evaluation, the recommendations by the Administrative Board and the multi-annual strategy, some provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 should be clarified and updated. Furthermore, the Agency should receive a number of additional tasks reflecting the development of the maritime safety policy at EU and international level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment report and the summary are attached to the proposal. The Impact Assessment Board issued its opinion on 22 June 2008 providing a number of recommendations for improvements of the draft report, which have been incorporated in the final version. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which has served as legal basis for Regulation 1406/2002. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to maintain EMSA's current tasks and institutional structure, ensuring continuity for the Agency’s activities which provide added value at EU-level and are well appreciated by the stakeholders. The proposal for a limited extension of EMSA's tasks reflects new needs. EMSA’s updated mandate would: clarify that the Stand-by Oil Spill Response Vessels under contract by EMSA can intervene also in case of oil pollution caused by offshore installations; increase EMSA's involvement in EU research (analysis of research projects and identification of research priorities); extend EMSA's technical assistance to all European Neighbourhood Policy countries in order to promote the EU maritime safety policy in all the regional seas bordering the EU; emphasise the role of EMSA's operational vessel traffic monitoring services as basis for extended transport and maritime information services, including in the context of the development of a Common Information Sharing Environment for the EU maritime domain; extend EMSA’s assistance in the development and implementation of EU policies, such as Motorways of the Sea, e-maritime as well as environmental aspects of shipping including climate change. Following an invitation by the European Parliament and the Council , the Commission services are working on a feasibility study regarding a European Coastguard service. The Commission services have concluded so far that synergies at EU level regarding certain coastguard operations could be reinforced through EMSA's activities. This could be further supported by extending EMSA's tasks in selected areas, in particular regarding the monitoring of maritime traffic and shipping routes as well as assistance to Member States in the tracking of possible polluters. Lastly, as regards the organisation of inspections by the Agency on behalf of the Commission, the roles of the Agency, the Commission, the Administrative Board and the Member States need to be clarified. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has a modest budgetary implication insofar as the Agency receives a limited number of new or extended tasks, for which EMSA would need 18 posts to ensure effective and efficient operation. However, in the light of the current budgetary situation, the Commission has agreed with the Agency a considerable redeployment effort, as a result of which 6 of these posts will be provided by EMSA itself through internal redeployment. This means that the Budgetary authority would need to decide in the forthcoming annual budgetary procedures only on a total of 12 additional posts for the Agency's establishment plan to be phased in between 2012 and 2014 (5 posts in 2012, 4 posts in 2013 and 3 posts in 2014). The budgetary impact of this proposal is thus limited to a total of approximatively EUR 3.9 million for the period 2012-2015."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Saint Lucia and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 11 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Saint Lucia on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Saint Lucia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Saint Lucia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Saint Lucia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Saint Lucia remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Saint Lucia reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Saint Lucia to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union using the procedure provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established by Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council for the duration of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. It was established to enable the Union to show solidarity towards workers who lost their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. After analysing the risks, the European Commission concluded that this proposal was necessary to ensure an effective response from the EGF and to show solidarity with workers made redundant in the Union as a result of a withdrawal from the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement. CONTENT: the proposed contingency Regulation should amend Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 in order to specify that redundancies resulting from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement fall within the scope of the EGF. Such a withdrawal would represent a major change in the EU's trade relations and the structure of the internal market and would therefore probably have significant repercussions on business models, growth and employment. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and should apply from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply in the United Kingdom. However, it should not apply if a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 50(2) TEU has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. When the Common Fisheries Policy ceases to apply to the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom waters (12 nautical miles territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will no longer be part of the Union waters. Consequently, in case of a disorderly withdrawal, Union vessels risk losing access to these waters and fishing opportunities therein as of 30 March 2019. This would have significant impact in terms of fishing activities of the Union fleet and economic returns. The overall dependency of 8 Member States on United Kingdom waters averages 14 % of their overall landings, ranging from 50 % for the Belgium fleet to around 1 % for Spain. At the local community level the socio-economic impact can be significant, where fishing vessels are particularly dependent on access to United Kingdom waters. The fisheries sector also links up to ancillary activities upstream and downstream. Measures are already available under Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council8 that can be used for mitigating the adverse economic effects due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union throughout the whole chain of production and marketing. Under shared management, Member States affected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may decide to redirect available appropriations to any necessary measure mitigating its consequences. However, this discretion is currently limited to some priorities. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 lays down the rules and arrangements for granting financial compensation to fishermen and owners of fishing vessels in cases of temporary cessation of fishing activities. The criteria to allow for temporary cessation do not allow for compensation due to the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union and the subsequent loss of access to and fishing opportunities within the waters of that State. In addition to the measures already available under Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, the adverse economic effects caused by the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union, public support for the temporary cessation of fishing activities should be available for fishermen and operators that have significant dependence on access to United Kingdom waters. CONTENT: the proposed act would amend Union Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, so as to provide financial mitigation measures Union vessels impacted by a possible closure of the United Kingdom waters due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to allow fishermen and operators from EU Member States to receive compensation from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for the temporary cessation of fishing activities. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and apply from the date following the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom and its territory. Alongside this measure to amend the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Commission is proposing a measure on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the multiannual financial framework, annual ceilings, or for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The proposal consists of the frontloading of payment appropriations and is budgetary-neutral over the programming period."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted in order to prevent or reduce the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment. Although plastic carrier bags constitute packaging within the meaning of that Directive, its provisions do not contain specific measures relating to the consumption of such bags. The use of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns, which are less frequently re-used than thicker plastic carrier bags, involves a considerable amount of litter, which will increase if measures are not taken. Consumption levels of plastic carrier bags vary considerably across the Union. Some Member States have managed to reduce consumption levels of plastic carrier bags significantly, with the average consumption level in the seven best performing Member States amounting to only 20% of the EU average consumption. To promote similar reductions of the average consumption level of lightweight plastic carrier bags, Member States should take measures to reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns in line with the overall objectives of the Union’s waste policy and the Union's waste hierarchy as provided for in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: instead of establishing a common EU target, it was considered preferable to introduce into Directive 94/62/EC the obligation for all Member States to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, while allowing them to set their own national reduction targets and to choose the measures to reach those targets. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 94/62/EC by requiring Member States to take measures to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. It stipulates that these measures may include the use of economic instruments as well as marketing restrictions in derogation of Article 18 of the Directive. The latter provision thus broadens the range of instruments available to Member States to address the unsustainable consumption of plastic bags. For the purpose of this Directive a definition of ""lightweight plastic carrier bags"" is introduced, and means bags made of plastic materials with a wall thickness below 50 microns that are supplied to consumers at the point of sale of goods or products."

Tasks and powers of the members of the team: as a general rule, the teams shall have the authority to perform the tasks and exercise the executive powers required for border control and return operations. They shall respect the laws and regulations of Albania. Members of the team shall wear their own uniform, visible personal identification and a blue armband with the insignias of the European Union and of the Agency on their uniforms. Members of the team may use force, including service weapons, ammunition and equipment, with the consent of their own State and of the Albania authorities, in the presence of Albanian border guards or other relevant staff, and in accordance with the Albanian law. Albanian authorities may authorise members of the team to use force also in the absence of their border guards. Accreditation document: the Agency shall, in cooperation with Albania, issue an accreditation document to members of the team for the purposes of identification vis-à-vis the Albanian authorities as proof of the holder’s rights to perform the tasks and exercise the powers conferred under this Agreement and in the Operational Plan. Fundamental rights: in the performance of their tasks and in the exercise of their powers, Members of the team shall fully respect fundamental rights and freedoms, including as regards access to asylum procedures, human dignity and the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to liberty, the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of collective expulsions, the rights of the child and the right to respect for private and family life. They shall not arbitrarily discriminate against persons on any grounds including sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, sexual orientation or gender identity. Each Party must have a complaint mechanism in place to deal with allegations of a breach of fundamental rights committed by its staff. Processing of personal data: personal data shall be processed by members of the team when necessary in accordance with the rules applicable to the Agency and the EU Member States. Processing of personal data by the Albanian authorities shall be subject to Albanian laws. The Agency, the participating Member States and the Albanian authorities shall draw up a common report on the processing of personal data by members of the team at the end of each action. This report shall be sent to the Agency's Fundamental Rights Officer and Data Protection Officer. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: although the status agreement in itself does not entail financial implications, it is the actual deployment of border guards' teams on the basis of an operational plan and relevant grant agreement that will entail costs borne by the budget of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Future operations under the status agreement will be financed through the European Border and Coast Guard Agency’s own resources. The financial statement annexed to the proposal for a Regulation on a European Border and Coast Guard on the expenditure of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency evaluated at EUR 6.090 million on average each year for 2017-2020 the reinforced cooperation with third countries (including possible joint operations with neighbouring countries)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the magnitude and characteristics of accidents affecting offshore oil and gas operations (for example, Deepwater Horizon in the US in 2010, Montara in Australia in 2009, Usumacinta in Mexico in 2007) which have been reported worldwide, including the Union, demand action. Studies, stakeholder consultations and risk analyses conducted since 2010 have identified the main problems for the Union as: The risk of a major offshore oil or gas accident occurring in Union waters is significant and the existing fragmented legislation and diverse regulatory and industry practices do not provide for all achievable reductions in the risks throughout the Union. The existing regulatory framework and operating arrangements do not provide for the most effective emergency response to accidents wherever they occur in Union waters, and the liabilities for clean-up and conventional damages are not fully clear. Based on frequency analysis of industry performance in Europe to date and on documented costs of past accidents, the estimated average annual economic losses and damage from offshore oil and gas accidents in the Union range from EUR 205 million to EUR 915 million. This range is used as the empirical basis of baseline risk in the impact assessment. It is estimated that the benefits accruing to the Union and Member States significantly outweigh the costs of introducing higher standards. According to the Commission, the control of major hazard risks in the offshore industry needs to be raised to consistently high standards throughout the Union. Four specific objectives need to be pursued: 1) Ensure a consistent use of best practices for major hazards control by oil and gas industry offshore operations potentially affecting Union waters or shores; 2) Implement best regulatory practices in all European jurisdictions with offshore oil and gas activities; 3) Strengthen Union's preparedness and response capacity to deal with emergencies potentially affecting Union citizens, economy or environment; 4) Improve and clarify existing Union liability and compensation provisions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the reference option which would preserve the status quo (Option 0), four strategic options were evaluated: Option 1 (""North Sea basic"") is the basic level for meaningful Union intervention. It introduces in Union law the Major Hazards Report (MHR) based upon the safety and health document required by Directive 92/91/EC but goes further in requiring the regulator to be satisfied with it prior to starting operations. An inspections and penalties regime would be required to underpin the measures described in the MHR. Option 1+ (""North Sea +"") goes further by introducing soft law guidelines for tightening consideration of the technical capacity of applicants for offshore oil and gas licenses; Option 2 (""Union Best practice"") develops further the reforms of option 1+ in a comprehensive package. Recognised global best practice in major hazard risk control would be mandated, and environmental risk assessment would be incorporated into the MHR. Also, best regulatory practice and required organisational standards would be introduced in arrangements for national competent authorities; Option 3 (""EU Agency"") further reinforces the impact of Option 2 by introducing an Union agency to institutionalise and thereby consolidate the reforms achieved by option 2. It would undertake inspections and investigations, monitor and enforce consistency in performance, develop intervention capacity and assist capacity building in adjacent non Union countries. The preferred policy option is Option 2, i.e. a comprehensive offshore reform raising throughout Union, through new law, the level of risk management and emergency preparedness in the offshore industry. The cost of the proposed measures (EUR 134 – 140 million/year) is modest when compared with the risk reduction that they would guarantee (EUR 103-455 million/year). LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 of the TFEU (Environment) for its environmental protection purposes and Article 194 (Energy) for minimising adverse effects on Union security of energy supply and the functioning of the internal energy market. CONTENT: the proposed regulation creates duties for operators, Member States and the Commission as follows. the Operator is to organise his activities around a best practice model; prepare a major hazards report (MHR) and to submit this to the competent authority for assessment. In addition, the Operator is to submit a notification for each well operation to the regulator; for both MHR's and well notifications, independent verification of the safety critical elements is required; Operators will prepare internal emergency response plans; promote interoperability and compatibility of response assets and report incidents and other specified information to the relevant Member State in a standard format; Union-based major companies would commit to demonstrating Union offshore safety standards wherever they work overseas. Member States: Member States licensing authorities would assess in an appropriate manner the potential safety and environmental performance (and financial capacity to deal with safety failures) of applicants when considering awards for exploration or production licenses. would establish competent authorities for supervision of safety, environmental protection and emergency preparedness and introduce robust standards for inspection and investigation, underpinned with appropriate penalties for breaches of duty by operators; will make information routinely available concerning their offshore sectors, and report all major incidents and lessons learned to the Commission; will prepare external emergency response plans, in collaboration with adjacent Member States. Measures will be taken to ensure interoperability of expertise and physical assets to support cross Union intervention including by EMSA. Member States and the industry will prepare and periodically test emergency response plans. Commission : the Commission is to establish an EU Offshore Authorities Group with representatives from the competent authorities responsible for offshore oil and gas activities in Union Member States. The Commission is to amend Environmental Liability Directive (2004/35/EC) within the regulation. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the budgetary implication of the proposal is approx EUR 2.5 million in the period 2013-2016, including compensations for committee participation. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
5229EP7,"""""European statistics""""",0.035,0.806,0.772,0.323,0.333,0.807,0.831,0.029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE : to amend Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics in order to strengthen the professional independence of national statistical authorities. PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : recent economic developments have once again demonstrated the need to further strengthen the credibility of statistics. Reliability of statistical data in terms of technical quality- assessment criteria is a pre-requisite in order to ensure the trust of users. But equally important is the credibility of the institutions producing statistics. In this context, the professional independence of statistical authorities must receive particular attention and be guaranteed by law. The Commission recognised this in its Communication ‘Towards robust quality management for European Statistics’ it indicated the need to strengthen the governance of the European Statistical System (ESS) by securing unconditional application of the principle of professional independence of National Statistical Institutes (NSIs), by clarifying their coordinating role in the national statistical systems and by enhancing the use of administrative data for statistical purposes. Furthermore, it was proposed that ‘Commitments on Confidence in Statistics’ (CoC) be established in order to make national governments aware of their role in, and co-responsibility for, ensuring the credibility of official statistics by respecting the independence of NSIs. According to the Communication, all these measures should be introduced by an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. Moreover, the European Statistics Code of Practice should be revised accordingly. The key relevance of the principle of professional independence of NSIs was also explicitly recognised by the European Parliament and the Council in the legislative ‘six-pack’ on enhanced economic governance, which entered into force in December 2011. It specified that the professional independence of national statistical authorities requires transparent recruitment and dismissal processes based solely on professional criteria. Moreover, on 13 March 2012 the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to rapidly implement measures to improve quality-management and governance in European statistics. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal largely builds on the final conclusions and recommendations of the ESS ‘Task Force on the revision of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 and on Commitments on Confidence in Statistics’, which met several times in 2011. LEGAL BASIS : Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the proposal calls for a revision of the current basic legal framework for European statistics, adapting it to meet the policy needs and challenges created for European statistics by recent developments in the global economy. The main goal is to further strengthen governance in the European Statistical System in order to safeguard its high credibility and to respond adequately to data needs resulting from the enhanced economic-policy coordination in the European Union. Professional independence of national statistical authorities : the proposal refers explicitly to the Heads of NSIs as persons whose independence in performing their duties is a pre-condition for establishing the independence of the respective institutions. To that end, it is indispensable that Heads of NSIs have the freedom to decide on processes, statistical methods, standards and procedures, and on the content and timing of statistical releases and publications for all European statistics. They must be also forbidden from seeking, and protected from receiving, instructions from national governments and other institutions. Moreover, Heads of NSIs should be granted considerable autonomy in deciding on the internal management of the statistical office and allowed to publicly comment on the budget allocated to the NSI in the context of statistical tasks to be performed. Furthermore, there must exist transparent and legally binding rules for the appointment, transfer and dismissal of Heads of NSI, based solely on professional criteria. However, Heads of NSIs should not only enjoy broad autonomy, they should also be accountable for the results the NSIs provide both in terms of statistical output and budget execution. Accordingly, they should present an annual report on the statistical activities and the financial situation of the respective authority. Commitments on Confidence in Statistics : the proposal also includes the establishment of ‘Commitments on Confidence in Statistics’. These declarations of respect of the European Statistics Code of Practice, and notably of the principle of independence of NSIs, aim at strengthening statistical governance in the EU and safeguarding the credibility of European statistics. According to the proposal, they should be signed by the governments of all Member States and counter-signed by the Commission, both at the highest applicable level. Each CoC is intended to be drafted individually by the Member State concerned and to contain country-specific improvement actions. The actual implementation of these actions would be monitored by Eurostat as part of the already established regular assessment of Member States’ compliance with the European Statistics Code of Practice. The role of the NSIs : the coordinating role of NSIs in the national statistical systems is clarified by the proposal and explicit references to institutions and functions to be coordinated have been added. In addition, the proposal contains further amendments. Administrative data: the proposal aims to establish a legal framework for more extensive use of administrative data sources for the production of European statistics without increasing the burden on respondents, NSIs and other national authorities. According to the proposal, NSIs should be involved, to the extent necessary, in decisions on the design, development and discontinuation of administrative records, which could be used in the production of statistical data. They should also coordinate relevant standardisation activities and receive metadata on administrative data extracted for statistical purposes. Free and timely access to administrative records should be granted to NSIs, other national authorities and Eurostat, but only within their own respective public administrative system and to the extent necessary for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics. Eurostat : the proposal incorporates the need to adequately secure the independent position of Eurostat at Union level in the same way as is proposed for NSIs at national level. It is crucial for the credibility of the entire European Statistical System and was strongly emphasised by a vast majority of the Member States in the preceding stakeholder consultation. Programming period : in order to simplify budget planning for statistical activities and to make it more stable, the programming period of the European statistical programme was brought into line with the Union’s multi-annual financial framework. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : The proposal is expected to have no resource impact within the ESS. On the contrary, it is meant to simplify and improve coordination and collaboration within the system, thus ultimately leading to more efficient production of European statistics and to a reduced burden on respondents. The human resources required within the Commission will be met by staff from the Directorate General who are already assigned to management of the legal act concerned and/or have been redeployed within the Directorate General. DELEGATED POWERS : the Commission will have the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Council Decision. CONTENT: to recall, relations between Tajikistan and the EC are currently governed by the trade and cooperation agreement signed with the former Soviet Union on 18 December 1989 (which entered into force on 1 April 1990), as endorsed by the Republic of Tajikistan in an exchange of letters on 4 February 1994. The Council adopted its negotiating directives on 5 October 1992, amending them on 10 October 2003, and the Commission formally launched the negotiations for a partnership and cooperation agreement in November 2003. After the second round of negotiations, the text of the agreement was initialed by the negotiators of the Commission and the Government of Tajikistan in Brussels on 16 December 2003. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is a mixed agreement covering some matters for which the European Communities are competent and others for which the Member States are competent. It is concluded for an initial period of ten years. The Agreement includes a clause permitting its unilateral suspension if an essential element is violated (i.e. respect for democracy, human rights and the principles of a market economy). The Agreement establishes institutional machinery for its implementation in the form of a Cooperation Council, a Cooperation Committee and a Parliamentary Committee. Pending the entry into force of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, it is proposed that the European Communities and Tajikistan conclude an interim agreement mainly concerning trade, cooperation and the institutional framework, as provided for in Article 101 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Having completed the negotiating process, the Commission now proposes that the Council approve the results of the negotiations and initiate the procedures for the signing and conclusion of this agreement. The proposed Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will help consolidate and strengthen the EU's political and economic and trade presence in Tajikistan and Central Asia in general. It also aims to promote economic growth and support sustainable development, action against poverty and stability in Tajikistan and Central Asia. In addition, it will provide a framework for future EU cooperation with Tajikistan. Though modelled on other partnership and cooperation agreements, the EU Tajikistan agreement is the first to include clauses on action against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. It will be concluded for a period of 10 years, automatically renewable from year to year thereafter. The Agreement will open the way for deeper relations in a great number of fields, based on reciprocity and partnership. The Agreement is founded on respect for the essential principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and on the promotion of sustainable development and the link between different aid instruments (the link between relief, rehabilitation and development). The proposed Agreement has three main components as well as general and institutional provisions to sustain those components: 1) Political dialogue: the EU and Tajikistan will pursue a regular political dialogue. They will in particular cooperate against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and trafficking, including the drugs trade; 2) Cooperation: the Agreement includes provisions in the area of social and economic cooperation, finance and trade, science, information society and technologies, culture, education and audio-visual, state reform and public administration, social and legislative cooperation. The Agreement also provides for commitments and cooperation in re-admission, in the control of illegal immigration, and in combating drugs and organized crime. The Agreement also provides for cooperation on democracy and human rights. A separate protocol covers mutual assistance in customs matters; 3) Trade: the Agreement also includes provisions on trade in goods and services and on trade and investment.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Framework Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by Directive 2009/140/EC invites the Commission to present a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and Council to establish a multiannual Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP) setting out policy orientations and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of spectrum, taking utmost account of the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG). Spectrum is essential for the digital society, fast wireless services, economic recovery, growth, high-quality jobs and long-term EU competitiveness. Spectrum policy initiatives are also key to the Digital Agenda for Europe and to the Europe 2020 strategy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identifies options and assesses whether EU intervention would add value compared to national or regional action. It identifies the strategic direction necessary for spectrum policy at EU level. It highlights the need for a global EU spectrum policy approach given the impact of spectrum on a number of sectors with varying degrees of EU competence. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed programme sets out policy orientations and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of spectrum use in order to achieve the internal market. It supports the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Digital Agenda for Europe and promotes other EU policies concerned with spectrum. It will ensure the application of principles and define policy orientations for all aspects of spectrum policy with an EU dimension. The programme sets concrete priority initiatives for enhanced coordination, flexibility, and availability of spectrum for wireless broadband communications and other specific EU policies; it requires an inventory of existing uses and emerging spectrum. It identifies improvements to safeguard EU interests in international negotiations, and to assist Member States in bilateral negotiations, and calls for improved cooperation between technical bodies."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Light commercial vehicles are mainly used by businesses, including small and medium enterprises and currently light commercial vehicles make up around 12% of the fleet. The average reduction of CO2 emissions over 2002-2007 for light commercial vehicles amounted to 0.4-0.5% per year, and these very limited improvements in fuel efficiency have been offset by the increase in demand for transport and vehicle size. While the EU as a whole has reduced its emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by approximately 9% over the 1990- 2007 period and emissions have been declining in non-transport sectors, the CO2 emissions from transport have increased by 29%. Despite significant improvements in vehicle motor technology, in particular in fuel efficiency which also means lower CO2 emissions, demand for transport and vehicle size has increased and progress has been too slow in view of the overall Community objective of average new passenger car emissions of 120 g CO2/km. Adopting Community targets for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent fragmentation in the internal market resulting from the adoption of different measures at Member State level. Furthermore, setting CO2  emission standards for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent a risk of regulatory gap resulting from certain overlap between the registrations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Furthermore, on 28 June 2007 the Council invited the Commission to come forward with a proposal on the improvement of fuel efficiency from light commercial vehicles. Lastly, it is important to encourage the automotive sector to invest in new technologies. The proposal will put in place a concrete measure to deliver on the targets and will therefore strengthen the EU's leadership position on climate change in the run-up to the United Nations Climate Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment investigated five main options: Options 1 and 2 : to define a linear curve giving the CO2  value to be achieved by a given vehicle as a function of its ""utility"" (mass) so that the average of the new light commercial vehicles in (1) 2012 and (2) 2013-2015 would deliver the 175 g CO2/km target. Options 3 and 4: based on the same target (175 g CO2/km) and years (respectively. 2012 and 2013-2015), but on the basis of a linear curve defining the CO2 value to be achieved as a function of an alternative ""utility"", namely pan area. Option 5: to require manufacturers to deliver a set percentage reduction corresponding to the reduction needed to achieve the 175 g CO2/km target in 2012-2015 compared to the 2007 situation. The impact assessment considered different flexibility mechanisms, including fleet averaging and pooling, as well as a compliance mechanism. In addition to the five policy options, several levels of the long-term target (ranging from 160 to 125 g CO2/km for year 2020) were analysed. CONTENT: the proposal is a follow-up of the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles and complements Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 (which sets CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars). It aims to reduce the impact of light-duty vehicles on the climate by ensuring that, from 1 July 2013, the average specific emissions of new light commercial vehicles registered in the Community do not exceed 175 g CO2/km. This target will be phased in gradually from 1 January 2014 onwards with full compliance of the new light commercial fleet from 2016. The starting date for the CO2  emissions standard for light commercial vehicles is consistent with the timeframe of the adoption by the Commission of the proposal for a regulation setting similar standards for passenger cars as of 2012. This indicates entry into force of the standard for light commercial vehicles from 2014. Further to the inclusion of the long-term target of 95 g/km as of 2020 in Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, this proposal sets a target of 135 g/km for light commercial vehicles to be achieved from 2020 subject to confirmation of its feasibility on the basis of updated impact assessment results. The key aspects of the proposal are: it will apply to light commercial vehicles of category N1, with a reference mass not exceeding 2610kg and vehicles to which type-approval is extended in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2007. N2 and M2 vehicles with a reference mass meeting the above criteria will be included for monitoring purposes and their full inclusion in the scheme will be considered during a review; it sets targets for the specific emissions of CO2  from new light commercial vehicles in the Community as a function of their mass. The targets will apply to the average specific emissions of CO2  in g/km for new light commercial vehicles for each manufacturer which are registered in the EU in each calendar year. Manufacturers may form a pool in order to meet their targets. Where two or more manufacturers form a pool, the pool will be treated as if it is one manufacturer for the purposes of determining its compliance with the targets; it includes incentives for early market deployment of low emitting light commercial vehicles by granting them super-credits on an interim basis; it includes provisions to promote eco-innovations (i.e. CO2-reducing technologies that are not captured by the test-cycle during which CO2  emissions are measured). Under this provision up to 7 g/km can be deducted from the average of a manufacturer’s specific CO2  emissions for innovative technologies which reduce emissions, based on independently verified data; Member States will be obliged to collect data on the new light commercial vehicles registered in their territory and to report this data to the Commission for the purposes of assessing compliance with the targets; if a manufacturer fails to meet its target, it will be required to pay an excess emissions premium. The premium will be calculated by multiplying the number of g CO2/km by which the manufacturer exceeded its target by the number of vehicles newly registered and by the excess emissions premium calculated as a function of the year and distance to target. The targets under the Regulation are established on the basis of the best knowledge currently available regarding, in particular, the likely fleet evolution between now and 2014 in respect of the 'autonomous weight increase'. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the implementation of the proposed Regulation will be carried out together with that of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 on CO2  from passenger cars as both share many features like, for example, the monitoring of manufacturers' performance against their CO2  reduction targets and, where necessary, the administration of excess emissions premiums provided for in the legislation. Expenditure already foreseen under the LIFE+ programme is considered sufficient, in particular because of the limited size of the market for light commercial vehicles compared to that for passenger cars. Therefore, this new proposal for CO2  emissions from light-duty vehicles would not require additional financial resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: fraud affecting the EU's financial interests is a cross-border phenomenon affecting all EU Member States. Experience shows that the Union's financial interests are impacted by both fraud and irregularities. The implementation of the past Union multi-annual budgets has been accompanied by a set of measures to support the Member States and the Union as a whole in preventing and fighting fraud affecting the Union's financial interests, and supporting mutual administrative assistance and cooperation in customs and agriculture matters. These measures include: the Hercule III spending programme which supports activities against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union; the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS) which is an operational activity consisting essentially in a set of customs IT applications operated under a common information system managed by the Commission; the Irregularity Management System (IMS) which is a secure electronic communications tool which facilitates the Member States' obligation to report detected irregularities, including fraud, and which supports the management and analysis of these. Although it is difficult to quantify their financial impact, these measures have contributed to bringing back large amounts of money into the EU budget. For example, Hercule funded the development of the Automated Monitoring Tool (AMT), an IT tool that identifies anomalies in trade flows and was instrumental in identifying large undervaluation fraud schemes in the import of textile and footwear from third countries in 2017. This proposal aims at streamlining the financial support for these tools, for the duration of the next multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027. The Commission stressed that the next multiannual financial framework shall be implemented against the background of significant changes in the legislative and institutional framework for the protection of the Union's financial interests, in particular with the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the implementation of Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and the Council on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the EU anti-fraud programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme is intended to replace the Hercule III programme and shall have a budget of EUR 181 million for the period 2021-2027. Its general objectives shall be to protect the financial interests of the Union and to support mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. The specific objectives of the programme shall be threefold: assist Member States and the European Union to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the EU's financial interests, by financing activities (technical assistance and training) which otherwise might not be available at national level (EUR 114.2 million); support the reporting of irregularities, including fraud, with regard to the shared management and pre-accession assistance funds of the Union budget (EUR 7 million); provide tools for information exchange and support for operational activities in the field of mutual administrative assistance in customs and agricultural matters (EUR 60 million). Implementation : the proposal specifies how the programme shall be implemented through grants, including the possible beneficiaries of the grants. The latter include public authorities which are likely to contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives of the programme, from any of the following countries: a Member State or an overseas country or territory linked to it, a third country associated with the programme or a third country listed in a work programme. The programme shall be implemented by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2008/971/EC2 provided the list of countries to be recognised for the application of the equivalence principle for importation and determined conditions under which forest reproductive material of the 'source identified' and 'selected' categories produced in those countries is imported in the Union. The national rules for the certification of forest reproductive material in Canada, Croatia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States of America provide for an official field inspection to be carried out during the collection and processing of seed and the production of planting stock. According to those rules, the systems for the approval and registration of basic material and the subsequent production of reproductive material from this basic material should follow the OECD Scheme for the certification of forest reproductive material moving in international trade (OECD Forest seed and plant scheme). In addition, those rules require seed and planting stock of the ‘source identified’ and ‘selected’ categories and of the category 'qualified' to be officially certified and the seed packages to be officially closed in accordance with the OECD Forest seed and plant scheme. An examination of those rules as regards the category 'qualified' has shown that the conditions for approval of basic material satisfy the requirements laid down in Council Directive 1999/105/EC on the marketing of forest reproductive material. Accordingly, the Commission considers it appropriate to add the category “qualified” to the 'source identified' and 'selected' categories. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. Member States and stakeholders proposed that the Commission should submit this updating to facilitate trades, in particular the importation of forest reproductive material and to promptly respond to the marketing request in particular for fast growing tree plantations intended for energy/biomass production.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households’ access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States for the exception of Ireland, the United Kingdom, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Georgia is currently listed in Annex I of the Regulation, i.e. among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. The EU-Georgia Visa Liberalisation Dialogue was launched in June 2012. In February 2013, the European Commission presented the Georgian Government with an action plan on visa liberalisation (VLAP). The VLAP is structured around four 'blocks': document security, including biometrics (block I), migration and integrated border management, including asylum (block II), public order and security (block III), and external relations and fundamental rights (block IV). Before the start of the Visa Liberalisation Dialogue, the EU and Georgia had concluded in parallel a Visa Facilitation Agreement and a Readmission Agreement, which entered into force on 1 March 2011. Their full and effective implementation has been an underlying condition for the launch and the continuation of the visa dialogue. It is considered that Georgia has met all the benchmarks set out in the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan presented to the Georgian Government and therefore fulfils the relevant criteria for its citizens to be exempted from the visa requirement when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Georgia from Annex I (list of visa-required countries) to Annex II (list of visa-free countries). It shall also be specified that the visa waiver will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a common and comparable legal framework for European statistics on migration and international protection. To respond to new needs within the Union for statistics on asylum and managed migration, and the rapidly changing characteristics of migration, the Commission considers that there is a need for a framework allowing quick response to changing needs as regards statistics on asylum and managed migration. The Commission has regularly acknowledged the need to improve the collection of statistics, particularly as regards the figures on the return of third-country nationals staying illegally in the EU, and as regards children. CONTENT: the main purpose of this initiative is to amend Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 so as to provide a legal basis for existing voluntary data collections already conducted by most national authorities, while providing the necessary flexibility to adapt to future data needs. On the basis of information provided by stakeholders and taking into account immediate priorities to address the most serious shortcomings, it is proposed to: increase the frequency of statistics on returns and obligations to leave from annual to quarterly, while introducing additional disaggregations; introduce new disaggregations of asylum statistics by unaccompanied minors; add new disaggregations of resettlement statistics; introduce statistics on first-time asylum applicants and new statistics on Dublin re-examination requests; introduce new disaggregations of statistics on residence permits. In order to ensure a better availability of European statistics on asylum and managed migration and to introduce a flexibility mechanism, the Commission could adopt implementing acts for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions on disaggregations."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa (ISF Borders and Visa) for the period 2014 to 2020, as well as Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management became applicable as of 1 January 2014. The purpose of the ISF-Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. The instrument will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors. The aim of the draft Agreement with Liechtenstein (the associated country) is to establish the arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approves the Agreement with Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The draft Decision aims to conclude arrangements between the Union and Liechtenstein on this country's contribution to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa for the period 2014-2020 and on the supplementary rules necessary for this participation. This proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part. Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Decision whether it will implement it in its national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was established in 1990 to support the development of market economies from central Europe to central Asia following the widespread collapse of communist regimes. The European Union, together with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and 40 countries (including all EU Member states at that time), were founding members. The EBRD is currently owned by 61 countries, the EU and the EIB. The initial capital of the EBRD was fixed at ECU 10 billion, of which the EU subscribed 3%. In 1996, the Governors of the EBRD decided to double the authorised capital of the EBRD for which the EU subscribed an additional 30 000 shares of EUR 10 000 each, bringing the EU subscribed capital at EUR 600 million. The EU share in the EBRD total authorised capital was maintained unchanged. At the Annual Meeting of the Governors of the EBRD on 14/15 May 2010, the Board of Governors adopted Resolutions 126 and 128 providing for an increase in the authorised capital stock of the Bank of 50% from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion. The capital increase comprises EUR 1 billion paid-in capital and EUR 9 billion of new callable capital. For the EU, it means that the EU shall subscribe up to an additional 27 013 callable shares (each worth EUR 10 000 each) amounting to EUR 270.13 million taking into account the EU proportion of 3.031% in the subscribed capital. The subscription of callable shares amounting to a total of EUR 9 billion will become effective as soon as the individual shareholders have completed their internal procedures and deposited their instruments of subscription, as it was the case for the 1996 capital increase. The Bank would expect that the callable capital increase will become effective at the end of April 2011, but in any event not later than 31 December 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the EBRD fourth Capital Resources Review (CRR4) for the period 2011-2015, which was undertaken during the past year, reflected the need for the Bank to respond effectively to the crisis and to redirect its medium term strategy taking account of the significant impact the crisis is having on its region of operations. In this framework, the EBRD carried out an analysis of capital enhancement options, based on the need to comply with the Bank’s statutory ‘gearing ratio’ and economic capital requirements, the maintenance of the Bank’s Triple-A credit rating, as well as the effective and efficient use of shareholders' capital. The efforts undertaken by the EBRD to mitigate the impact of the crisis in all its countries of operations through the proposed capital increase will allow the Bank to sustain a high level of activity and accompany the recovery in its region of operations, in cooperation with the EIB and other International Financial Institutions. It is expected that the capital increase would enable the EBRD to have an annual business volume of about EUR 9 billion for 2011 and 2012, and about EUR 8.5 billion until 2015. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under the terms and conditions of Resolution 128 on capital increase in the form of additional subscription of callable capital, the authorised capital stock of the Bank shall be increased by 900 000 callable shares, each share having a par value of EUR 10 000 which shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of the above Resolution. The EU is entitled to subscribe up to 27 013 callable shares. The proposed Decision aims at authorising the EU to take part in the callable part of the EBRD capital increase by subscribing to the shares it is allowed to. According to the terms of the Resolution 128, each member of the EBRD shall deposit with the Bank an instrument of subscription whereby the member subscribes to the number of callable shares specified in such instrument. In addition, the member shall deposit a representation that the member has duly taken all legal and other internal action necessary to enable it to make such subscription. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: as regards the callable part of the capital increase, its budgetary impact will be catered for by the budget line 01 03 01 02 ""European Bank for Reconstruction and Development – Callable portion of subscribed capital"", which has been established in the 2011 budget, so as to reflect the EU budget's liability deriving from the callable part of the EU participation in the EBRD's capital. The budget line should be endowed with a 'p.m.' reflecting the contingent nature of the call and a budgetary comment defining the size of the contingent liability. Although a call is considered to be highly unlikely, the budgetary line and its comment will reflect the financing needs which could arise in the event of a payment request by the EBRD relating to the callable part of the capital subscribed by the EU. The modalities of the EU participation in the capital increase of the EBRD do not foresee any operational expenditure. The amount for human resources amounts to EUR 135 million for 2010 to 2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/615/JHA) and the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/616/JHA) are intended to improve the exchange of information between the services responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences and to strengthen cross-border police and judicial cooperation between the Member States of the Union. The Prüm Decision contains, inter alia, provisions whereby Member States grant one another, on a mutual basis, access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities (’the Forensic Decision’) lays down the requirements for the exchange of DNA and fingerprint data, in order to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within any other Member State. On 10 June 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Principality of Liechtenstein on the application of certain provisions of Council Decision 2008/615/JHA, of Council Decision 2008/616/JHA, and the Annex thereto, and of Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities. The negotiations have been successfully finalised with the both countries by the initialling of the Agreement on 24 May 2018. The possibility for all the Member States to have access to the national databases of the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Lichtenstein, regarding the DNA, dactyloscopic and vehicle registration data, and the other way around, is undoubtedly of central importance in order to foster and encourage the cross-border police cooperation. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Liechtenstein for the application of some of the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision that shall become applicable to the Principality of Liechtenstein after entry into force of the Agreement. This international agreement between the EU and Liechtenstein aims to improve and simplify the automated exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and this associated country, in order to stimulate international police cooperation. The Agreement lists the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision that shall become applicable to the Principality of Liechtenstein after entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement also sets the provisions for uniform application, dispute settlement, amendments, notifications and declarations. The contracting Parties agree to carry out common review of the agreement no later than five years after its entry into force. The Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period whilst one of the Contracting Parties can terminate the Agreement at any time.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union’s economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aims to amend: (i) Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles; (ii) Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators. It is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste; Directive 1994/62/EC on package and packaging waste; Directive 1999/31/EC on landfill waste. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets ‘fit for purpose’; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction – more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Directives 2000/53/EC, 2006/66/EC and 2012/19/EU in order to improve waste management in the Union, with a view to protecting, preserving and improving the quality of the environment, protecting human health, ensuring prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources and promoting a more circular economy. The proposed amendments aim to: simplify the permit and registration requirements for small establishments or undertakings; simplify reporting obligations : it is proposed to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce implementation reports every three years and use exclusively the statistical data which Member States report every year to the Commission; improve the reporting of statistics in order for the Commission to assess compliance with waste legislation across the Member States, by introducing a single entry point for all waste data, deleting obsolete reporting requirements, benchmarking national reporting methodologies and introducing a data quality check report. provide that, when preparing the reports on compliance with the targets set out in these Directives, Member States should be required to use the most recent methodology developed by the Commission and the national statistical offices of Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a single common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. CONTENT: this proposal lays down rules on the objectives to be pursued through Union support financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) under the CAP. It also defines the new working method covering direct payments to farmers, rural development support and sectoral support programmes. Objectives adapted to the new priorities : the CAP general objectives shall focus on the economic viability, the resilience and income of farms, on an enhanced environmental and climate performance, and on the strengthened socio-economic fabric of rural areas. The future CAP shall focus on nine specific objectives: support viable farm income and resilience across the EU territory to enhance food security; enhance market orientation and increase competitiveness including greater focus on research, technology and digitalisation; improve farmers' position in the value chain; contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as sustainable energy; foster sustainable development and efficient management of natural resources such as water, soil and air; contribute to the protection of biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services and preserve habitats and landscapes; attract young farmers and facilitate business development in rural areas; promote employment, growth, social inclusion and local development in rural areas, including bio-economy and sustainable forestry; improve the response of EU agriculture to societal demands on food and health, including safe, nutritious and sustainable food, as well as animal welfare. Moreover, fostering knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas is a cross-cutting objective. To deliver on these objectives Member States shall ensure simplification and performance of CAP support. Greater flexibility for Member States : Member States shall have a certain level of flexibility for transfers between allocations. The focus shall be less on rules and compliance and more on results and performance. This approach will give far greater freedom to Member States to decide how best to meet the common objectives at the same time as responding to the specific needs of their farmers, rural communities and society at large. Member States shall present their proposed interventions to achieve the EU specific objectives in a CAP strategic plan. In the plans, Member States shall set targets on what they want to achieve in the programming period using commonly defined result indicators. The Commission shall assess the proposed CAP strategic plans to ensure the consistency and coherence with the general principles of Union law and the protection of the internal market. Once the CAP strategic plans are established, Member States shall annually report on the progress made in the implementation. The Member States and Commission will monitor progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. Better targeting of aid : direct payments shall remain an essential part of the policy, as farmers' income needs to be supported to foster a smart and resilient agricultural sector. Priority shall be given to supporting small and medium-sized farms and young farmers. Income support should be targeted to genuine farmers. The proposal provides inter alia for: a reduction of payments as of EUR 60 000 and compulsory capping for payments above EUR 100 000 per farm, with the possibility for Member States to deduct labour costs from the amount of direct payments; the possibility of granting a higher level of support per hectare for small and medium-sized farms; the obligation for Member States to allocate at least 2% of their direct payment allocation to attract young farmers. Member States should be allowed to use part of their financial ceiling available for direct payments for coupled income support in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability, and/or quality in certain sectors and productions that are particularly important for social, economic or environmental reasons and undergo certain difficulties. More ambitious environmental and climate objectives : direct payments shall be conditional on increased environmental and climate requirements. A new system of so-called ‘eco-schemes’, funded from national direct payment allocations, will be mandatory for Member States, although farmers will not be obliged to join them. These eco-schemes will have to address the CAP environment and climate objectives in ways that complement the other relevant tools available and go beyond what is already requested under the conditionality requirements. Member States will be required to dedicate at least 30% of their rural development budget to environment and climate measures. 40% of the total CAP budget shall contribute to climate action. For rural development, it is proposed to rebalance the financing between the EU and Member States’ budgets. Less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain interventions such as LEADER and the payments for management commitments. Member States shall have the possibility to transfer up to 15% of respective direct payments to EAFRD allocation and vice versa. A higher percentage can be transferred from direct payments to EAFRD allocation for interventions addressing environmental and climate objectives and installation grants for young farmers. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy."
6778EP7,"""""Markets in financial instruments and repeal of Directive 2004/39/EC""""",0.877,0.821,0.912,0.484,0.303,0.795,0.8,0.029,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to adopt new rules for more sound, transparent and efficient EU financial markets (recast of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) (Directive 2004/39/EC), in force since November 2007, is a core pillar in EU financial market integration. It establishes a regulatory framework for the provision of investment services in financial instruments (such as brokerage, advice, dealing, portfolio management, underwriting etc.) by banks and investment firms and for the operation of regulated markets by market operators. It also establishes the powers and duties of national competent authorities in relation to these activities. The result after 3.5 years in force is more competition between venues in the trading of financial instruments, and more choice for investors in terms of service providers and available financial instruments, progress which has been compounded by technological advances. Overall, transaction costs have decreased and integration has increased. However, some problems have surfaced: the benefits from this increased competition have not flowed equally to all market participants and have not always been passed on to the end investors, retail or wholesale; the market fragmentation implied by competition has also made the trading environment more complex; market and technological developments have outpaced various provisions in MiFID; the financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the regulation of instruments other than shares, traded mostly between professional investors. In line with the recommendations from the de Larosière group and the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of June 2009, the revision of MiFID therefore constitutes an integral part of the reforms aimed at establishing a safer, sounder, more transparent and more responsible financial system. It is also an essential vehicle for delivering on the G20  commitment to tackle less regulated and more opaque parts of the financial system, and improve the organisation, transparency and oversight of various market segments, especially in those instruments traded mostly over the counter (OTC), complementing the legislative proposal on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. The review of MiFID will contribute to establishing a single rulebook for EU financial markets, help further develop a level playing field for Member States and market participants, improve supervision and enforcement, reduce costs for market participants, and improve conditions of access and enhance the global competitiveness of the EU financial industry. The proposal amending MiFID is divided in two: this proposed Directive on markets in financial instruments, repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council; the draft Regulation on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation [EMIR] on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were assessed against different criteria: transparency of market operations for regulators and market participants, investor protection and confidence, level playing field for market venues and trading systems in the EU, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the review of MiFID is estimated to generate one-off compliance costs of between EUR 512 and EUR 732 million and ongoing costs of between EUR 312 and EUR 586 million. This represents one-off and ongoing cost impacts of respectively 0.10% to 0.15% and 0.06% to 0.12% of total operating spending of the EU banking sector. This is far less than the costs imposed at the time of the introduction of MiFID. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive amends specific requirements regarding the provision of investment services, the scope of exemptions from the current Directive, organisational and conduct of business requirements for investment firms, organisational requirements for trading venues, the authorisation and ongoing obligations applicable to providers of data services, powers available to competent authorities, sanctions, and rules applicable to third-country firms operating via a branch. A central aim of the proposal is to ensure that all organised trading is conducted on regulated trading venues: regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and organised trading facilities (OTFs). Identical pre and post trade transparency requirements will apply to all of these venues. Likewise, the requirements in terms of organisational aspects and market surveillance applicable to all three venues are nearly identical. This will ensure a level playing field where there are functionally similar activities bringing together third-party trading interests. Importantly however, the transparency requirements will be calibrated for different types of instruments, notably equity, bonds, and derivatives, and for different types of trading, notably order book and quote driven systems. The main elements of the proposed Directive are as follows: Extension of MiFID rules to like products and services : the proposals extend MiFID requirements, and particularly conduct of business and conflicts of interest rules, to the advised and non-advised sale of structured deposits by credit institutions, specify that MiFID also applies to investment firms and credit institutions selling their own securities when not providing any advice, and require Member States to apply authorisation and conduct of business requirements analogous to MiFID in national legislation applicable to locally-based entities. Revision of exemptions from MiFID : the proposal therefore limits the exemptions more clearly to activities which are less central to MiFID and primarily proprietary or commercial in nature, or which do not constitute high-frequency trading. Upgrades to the market structure framework : the proposal creates a new category for organised trading facilities which do not correspond to any of the existing categories, underpinned by strong organisational requirements and identical transparency rules, and upgrade key requirements across all venues to account for the greater competition and cross-border trading generated together by technological advances and MiFID. Improvements to corporate governance : the proposals seek to ensure members of the management body possess the sufficient knowledge and skills and comprehend the risks associated with the activity of the firm in order to ensure the firm is managed in a sound and prudent way in the interests of investors and market integrity. Enhanced organisational requirements to safeguard the efficient functioning and integrity of markets : the proposals aim to bring all entities engaged in high-frequency trading into MiFID, require appropriate organisational safeguards from these firms and those offering market access to other high-frequency traders, and require venues to adopt appropriate risk controls to mitigate disorderly trading and ensure the resiliency of their platforms. Enhancement of the investor protection framework : the proposal strengthens the regulatory framework for the provision of investment advice and portfolio management and the possibility for investment firms to accept incentive by third parties (inducements) as well as it clarifies the conditions and arrangements under which investors are able to transact freely in the market in certain non-complex instruments with minimal duties or protections afforded on behalf of their investment firm. Furthermore, it reinforces the requirements concerning the handling of funds or instruments belonging to clients by investment firms and their agents and classifies as an investment service the safekeeping of financial instruments on behalf of clients. The proposal helps improving the information to clients in relation to the services provided to them and to the execution of their orders. Heightened protection in the provision of investment services to non-retail clients : the overarching high level principle to act honestly, fairly and professionally and the obligation to be fair, clear and not misleading should apply irrespective of client categorization. Finally, it is proposed that eligible counterparties benefit from better information and documentation for services provided. New requirements for trading venues : the proposal therefore introduces a requirement for trading venues to publish annual data on execution quality. Second, commodity derivative contracts traded on trading venues frequently attract the broadest participation by users and investors and can often serve as a benchmark price discovery venues feeding into, for example, retail energy and food prices. It is therefore proposed that all trading venues on which commodity derivative contracts are traded adopt appropriate limits or alternative arrangements to ensure the orderly functioning of the market. An improved regime for SME markets : it is proposed to create a new subcategory of markets known as SME growth markets. An operator of such a market (which are usually operated as MTFs) could elect to apply to have the MTF also registered as an SME growth market if it meets certain conditions. Third country regime : the proposal creates a harmonised framework for granting access to EU markets for firms and market operators based in third countries in order to overcome the current fragmentation into national third country regimes and to ensure a level playing field for all financial services actors in the EU territory. It introduces a regime based on a preliminary equivalence assessment of third country jurisdictions by the Commission. Third country firms from third countries for which an equivalence decision has been adopted would be able to request to provide services in the Union. Services provided to eligible counterparties would not require the establishment of a branch; third country firms could provide them subject to ESMA registration. They would be supervised in their country. Appropriate cooperation agreement between the supervisors in third countries and national competent authorities and ESMA would be necessary. Increased and more efficient data consolidation : the proposals improve the quality and consistency of data by requiring that all firms publish their trade reports through Approved Publication Arrangement (APA). The provisions set procedures for competent authority to authorise the APAs and set organisational requirements for the APAs. Heightened powers over derivative-positions for competent authorities : the regulators would be bestowed with explicit powers to demand information from any person regarding the positions held in the derivative instruments concerned as well as in emission allowances. The supervisory authorities would be able to intervene at any stage during the life of a derivative contract and take action that a position be reduced. This heightened position management would be complemented by the possibility to limit positions in an ex-ante, non-discriminatory fashion. All actions should be notified to ESMA. Effective sanctions : Member States should provide that appropriate administrative sanctions and measures can be applied to breaches of MiFID. To this end, the Directive will require them to comply with the following minimum rules. The maximum level of administrative pecuniary sanctions laid down in national legislation should exceed the benefits derived from the breach if they can be determined and, in any case, should not be lower than the level provided for by the Directive. Criminal sanctions are not covered by this proposal. Emission allowances : unlike trading in derivatives, spot secondary markets in EU emission allowances (EUAs) are largely unregulated. A range of fraudulent practices have occurred in spot markets which could undermine trust in the emissions trading scheme (ETS), set up by the EU ETS Directive. In parallel to measures within the EU ETS Directive to reinforce the system of EUA registries and conditions for opening an account to trade EUAs, the proposal would render the entire EUA market subject to financial market regulation. Both spot and derivative markets would be under a single supervisor. MiFID and the Directive 2003/6/EC on market abuse would apply, thereby comprehensively upgrading the security of the market without interfering with its purpose, which remains emissions reduction. Moreover, this will ensure coherence with the rules already applying to EUA derivatives and lead to greater security as banks and investment firms, entities obliged to monitor trading activity for fraud, abuse or money laundering, would assume a bigger role in vetting prospective spot traders. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to task allocated to ESMA. Total appropriations are estimated at EUR 1 744 million from 2013 to 2015. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In the absence of an agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom governing the matter, there would be no legal basis for the provision of air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States by the respective carriers after the end of the transition period under the withdrawal agreement. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The disruption of air transport connectivity would represent the loss of a strategic asset for the EU and the Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to ensure the provision of certain air services between the United Kingdom and the European Union for a limited period of 6 months (until 30 June 2021) if no agreement governing this area can be reached, provided that the United Kingdom does the same. The proposal provides for: - the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories; - the possibility for UK carriers to provide those services by means of code-sharing or blocked-space arrangements, and to enter into leasing arrangements under strict conditions; - a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by Union carriers in the United Kingdom stay equivalent to those granted to UK carriers under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts; - the establishment of a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union air carriers enjoy fair and equal conditions of competition with United Kingdom carriers once the United Kingdom is no longer bound by Union law; - the establishment of procedures to enable Member States to verify that air carriers, aircraft and crews entering their territory under the Regulation are licensed or certified by the United Kingdom in accordance with internationally recognised safety standards."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. CONTENT: the Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/352 which establishes a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports. It is proposed that the new transitional provision shall provide Member States with the option to allow managing bodies of a port or competent authorities to decide whether to:  waive (condone, i.e. not require the payment at all); or suspend (freeze or put on hold the payment for a certain time period); or reduce (decrease the payment); or defer (require the payment at a later point in time) the payment of the port infrastructure charges. As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. This new provision also stipulates that the managing body of a port or the competent authority shall ensure that port users and the representatives or associations of port users are informed accordingly. The time limit of two months referred to in Regulation (EU) 2017/352 shall not apply."
8768EP8,"""""European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)""""",0.343,0.882,0.98,0.708,0.173,0.687,0.911,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure the continuation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). BACKGROUND: the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) - initially established for the programming period 2007-2013 - is a concrete expression of EU solidarity with European workers who lost their jobs. It was set up to provide support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns caused by globalisation and whose redundancies have a significant adverse impact on the regional or local economy. Union involvement through the EGF complements national measures in order to re-integrate dismissed workers by offering them a unique combination of tailored measures that lead to more sustainable results, increase the self-esteem of beneficiaries, who finally have a more proactive approach to job seeking, and improve their employability. Experience achieved so far with the EGF indicates that the help offered would not have been available without the involvement of the EGF. For the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, the scope of the EGF has been extended by Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which has to be revised by the end of 2020. The prime objective of this proposal is to ensure that the EGF continues to operate beyond 31 December 2020, to enlarge its objective offer and to amend some technical details in order to have more coherence and synergies, flexibility, focus on performance, and simplification. IMPACT ANALYSIS: the most important finding regarding the EGF is that as an emergency assistance fund, the EGF should remain outside the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). It lays down the objectives of the EGF, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding, including applications by the Member States for financial contributions from the EGF for measures targeting the eligible beneficiaries. Mission and objectives of the EGF : it is proposed to explicitly include in the mission the role played by the EGF in contributing to the implementation of the principles defined under the European Pillar of Social Rights. In addition, the specific objective of the EGF is to offer assistance in case of unexpected major restructuring events, particularly those caused by globalisation-related challenges, such as: changes in world trade patterns; trade disputes; financial or economic crises; the transition to low-carbon economy; or as a consequence of digitisation or automation. Particular emphasis shall lie on measures that help the most disadvantaged groups. Intervention criteria : the Commission proposes to lower the threshold of displaced workers for a case to be eligible, from 500 to 250 within a reference period of four months (or 6 months in sectoral cases). This is because there is a general trend of fewer very large scale redundancies and because the dismissal of 250 workers usually has a significant impact in most regions. This is also to acknowledge the fact that in many Member States, most workers are employed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A new provision has been added allowing Member States to apply for EGF assistance if redundancies occur in the same region but in different economic sectors. Eligible measures : as a change to the current Regulation, the inclusion of the dissemination of skills required in the digital age shall be a mandatory horizontal element of any coordinated package of personalised services offered. The proposed measures shall be based on the personal needs and qualifications of the beneficiary. Technical assistance from the Commission : this assistance shall support any measures necessary to implement the proposed Regulation. This amount could reach up to 0.5 % of the annual maximum amount of the EGF. This is higher than in the current programming period. This shall also include additional measures to increase networking and the exchange of good practice between Member States. Amount of financial contribution : the Fund's co-financing rate which currently stands at 60%, will be aligned with the highest ESF+ co-financing rates for a given Member State. In several cases this would mean that the EU co-finances a higher share of the total cost. Eligibility period : the standard period for the implementation of EGF measures shall remain at 24 months. However, the proposal stipulates that the 24-month period shall be counted from the time the decision to mobilise the EGF is adopted and not from the date of application for EGF support. Funding allocated to the EGF : the EGF is not included in the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. The maximum amount that can be used by the EGF for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 1.57 billion (in current prices), or an average of EUR 225 million per year."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 94/9/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The proposal does not change the scope of Directive and the essential health and safety requirements. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the products are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the products bear the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 94/9/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 94/9/EC on the placing on the market of products has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their products comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant article is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No 29) of the ILO is one of the ILO’s eight fundamental Conventions that make up the core international labour standards, and it is considered a human rights instrument. Yet, more than 80 years later, despite almost universal ratification of the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different forms to those that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century. The ILO estimates that at least 20.9 million people globally are victims of forced labour. In 2014, the International Labour Conference adopted the Protocol on the forced labour convention seeks to address gaps in implementation and to make progress on preventing trafficking for labour exploitation and protecting and compensating victims of forced labour. The European Union (EU) is committed to promoting human rights and decent work and to eradicating trafficking in human beings, both internally and in its external relations. In ratifying ILO Conventions and related Protocols, EU Member States send an important signal on the coherence of the EU’s policy in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work and improving working conditions worldwide. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to authorise the Member States to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation. The Protocol is a binding international agreement, subject to ratification, and is linked to the Convention. It creates legal obligations applicable to ratifying States and can only be ratified by States that have ratified the Convention. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), and more specifically on concluding and ratifying an ILO Convention, Member States are not able to decide to ratify the Protocol outside the framework of the EU’s institutions, as parts of the Protocol fall into areas of EU competence. However, the EU as such cannot ratify an ILO Protocol, because under the ILO rules only States can be parties to such Protocols. The Protocol’s provisions strengthen the international legal framework by establishing obligations to prevent forced labour and to provide victims with protection and access to remedies, such as compensation. The Protocol sets out the measures that ILO Member States must take to prevent forced labour, namely: The Protocol addresses areas of EU law that are already subject to an advanced degree of regulation: (i) certain aspects covered by EU social policy, in respect of which EU law sets minimum rules on working conditions; (ii) certain aspects relating to the freedom of movement for workers. The Commission proposes that the Decision should be based on the one hand on Article 153(2) TFEU, second subparagraph TFEU, in conjunction with Article 218(6) TFEU, which provides the main legal basis for EU legislation on protecting and improving working conditions, relevant to preventing forced labour. The provisions of the draft Protocol other than the provisions related to social policy will be subject to a Decision adopted in parallel to this Decision. The Decision recommends that Member States should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Protocol with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably by 31 December 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. At the end of the transition period, and in the absence of any special provision, all rights and obligations ensuing from Union law in respect of market access would be ended, insofar as the relationship between the United Kingdom and the Union and its Member States is concerned. In such a situation, the international transport of goods and passengers by road between the Union and the United Kingdom would be severely disrupted. PURPOSE: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down temporary measures to govern the carriage of goods by road as well as the provision of regular and special regular passenger transport services between, on the one side, the Union and, on the other side, the United Kingdom following the end of the transition period referred to in the withdrawal agreement. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a strictly time-limited period of 6 months (until 30 June 2021) provided that the UK provides the same guarantees to EU carriers. The proposal provides for: - the unilateral granting of rights for bilateral carriage to road haulage operators established in United Kingdom so that they can continue to carry goods between their territory and the Union; - the unilateral granting of rights for the bilateral carriage of passengers by coach and bus as part of regular or special regular services to bus and coach operators established in the United Kingdom so that they can continue to carry passengers between their territory and the Union; - the unilateral granting of rights to pick up and set down passengers in the border region of Ireland in the course of international regular and special regular services between Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland. In addition, the proposal: - makes rights granted to United Kingdom road operators subject to conformity with the relevant Union law applicable to road freight and road passenger transport operators and equivalent rights being granted by the United Kingdom to Union road operators; - lays down a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by EU road operators in the United Kingdom are equivalent to those granted to United Kingdom road operators under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of delegated acts; - lays down a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union road haulage operators and coach and bus service operators enjoy fair and equal opportunities to compete with United Kingdom road haulage operators and coach and bus service operators."

BACKGROUND: at its meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council stated that Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkan entities should be preceded by asymmetrical trade liberalisation. By introducing exceptional trade measures in favour of the countries and territories participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process, Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, which applies until 31 December 2020, has allowed such liberalisation. Stabilisation and Association Agreements have now been concluded with all six relevant entities of the Western Balkans, namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Even though most of the trade preferences initially granted to the Western Balkans through the autonomous trade regime have now been integrated in their respective Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union, the limited preferences granted through this Regulation still provide a valuable support to the regional economy. These preferences allow for the suspension of the specific duties normally applied to fruits and vegetables and for the inclusion of a global wine quota available after exhaustion of the countries’ respective national wine quotas. The ATMs system contributed to the expansion of the total trade between the EU and the Western Balkans which exceeded EUR 54 billion in 2018. The EU is the leading trade partner accounting for over 72% of the region's total trade. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to extend the period of application of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 until 31 December 2025. The proposed measures have been in place for almost 20 years, but are now considerably reduced, as most of the preferences have been gradually integrated into the various Stabilisation and Association Agreements concluded between the EU and the beneficiaries. While the estimated impact is considered minimal in terms of loss of customs duties for the EU - around EUR 23.5 million for all six beneficiaries, based on the import value in 2018 - the extension of the measures is considered the best guarantee of the EU's commitment to the trade integration of the Western Balkans. It would also help to ensure stable market access conditions for economic operators both in the region and in the EU. The unilateral preferences to Kosovo were included in the EU-Kosovo Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which entered into force on 1 April 2016. The autonomous trade preferences do no longer concern any fishery or beef trade concessions. It is therefore proposed to remove any references to these two categories of products. This proposal is consistent with the political guidelines of the new Commission, which has reaffirmed the European perspective of the Western Balkans and its important role in the continued reform process across the region. The European Union aims to promote peace, stability and economic development in the region and open up the prospect of EU integration. Budgetary implications The proposed Regulation does not incur additional costs in the EU budget. For the years 2020 to 2025 there will be no additional tariff revenue foregone in respect of products produced by the current beneficiaries. Hypothetical revenue that could have been collected from additional new imports is not considered as a loss of tariff revenue."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC. The EU signed the FCTC Protocol on 20 December 2013. Illicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than €10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries. Since the illicit products mostly originate from countries outside the EU, international cooperation, in particular also based on clear legislative procedures, is key to addressing the problem of illicit trade. The FCTC Protocol currently constitutes the only multilateral regulatory initiative in the area. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The Protocol contains a complex set of measures, rules and policy in the field of fighting illicit trade in tobacco products. This Decision applies to the provisions of the Protocol which fall within the scope of Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Freedom, Security and Justice). The Protocol contains: The United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark shall not take part in the adoption of the Decision. In parallel to this proposal, the Commission presented a separate proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol, on behalf of the European Union, as regards provisions which do not fall under Title V of Part III of the TFEU."
4535EP7,"""""Right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and right to communicate upon arrest""""",0.947,0.938,0.93,0.355,0.394,0.904,0.882,0.771,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to set common minimum standards on the rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings throughout the EU to have access to a lawyer and to communicate upon arrest with a third person, such as a relative, employer or consular authority. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union stipulates the right to a fair trial. The right of access to a lawyer is enshrined in Article 6 of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and in Article 14(2) of the ICCPR. The right to communicate with a third party is one of the important safeguards against ill treatment prohibited by Article 3 ECHR and the right to have one’s consulate informed of detention builds upon the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The European Court of Human Rights has consistently held that the suspect or accused person should have access to a lawyer at the initial stages of police questioning, and in any event from the start of detention, to protect the right to a fair trial, and in particular the privilege against self-incrimination and to avoid ill treatment. Derogations from the right of access to a lawyer and the right to communicate upon arrest should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. The Council recognised that to date, not enough had been done at European level to safeguard the fundamental rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The proposal is the next step in the series of measures laid down in the Resolution of the Council of 30 November 2009 on a Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings, appended to the Stockholm Programme approved by the European Council of 10-11 December 2010. The Roadmap invites the Commission to put forward proposals on a ‘step-by-step’ basis. The proposal is the next step in the series of measures laid down in a Resolution of the Council of 30 November 2009 on a Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings, appended to the Stockholm Programme approved by the European Council of 10-11 December 2010. The Roadmap invites the Commission to put forward proposals on a ‘step-by-step’ basis. This proposal should therefore be considered as part of a comprehensive package of legislation to be presented over the next few years, which will provide a minimum set of procedural rights in criminal proceedings in the European Union. The issue of legal aid, which was conflated with that of access to a lawyer in the Roadmap, warrants a separate proposal owing to the specificity and complexity of the subject. the first step is Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation; the second step will be a Directive, currently under negotiation on the basis of a Commission proposal, on the right to information, which will set out minimum rules on the right to receive information on one’s rights, and on the charges, as well as on the right of access to the case file. Having common minimum standards governing these rights should boost mutual trust between judicial authorities and thus facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the Directive is to lay down rules governing the rights of suspected and accused persons and persons subject to an European Arrest warrant to have access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings against them, and rules governing the right of suspects and accused persons who are deprived of their liberty to communicate upon arrest with a third party, such as a relative, employer or consular authority. The Directive applies from the time that a person is made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State, by official notification or otherwise, that he is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings (including any appeal). The main elements of this proposal are the following: The right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings : the proposal lays down the general principle that all suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings should have access to a lawyer as soon as possible, in time and in a manner that allows them to exercise their defence rights. Access to a lawyer must be granted at the latest upon deprivation of liberty, as soon as possible in the light of the circumstances of each case. Irrespective of any deprivation of liberty, access to a lawyer must be granted upon questioning. Content of the right of access to a lawyer : the proposal sets out the activities that a lawyer representing an accused or suspected person must be entitled to carry out to ensure effective exercise of defence rights, including meeting with the suspect or accused person for an adequate duration and frequency to ensure the effective exercise of the rights of defence; attending any questioning or hearing. The right to communicate upon arrest : the proposal provides for the right of persons deprived of their liberty in criminal proceedings to communicate as soon as possible upon arrest with one person nominated by them, which is most likely to be a relative or employer, so as to inform him of the detention. Legal representatives of children deprived of their liberty should be notified as soon as possible of the child’s custody and the reasons pertaining thereto, unless it is against the best interests of the child. Where it is not possible to communicate with or notify the person designated by the detained person despite best endeavours to do so, the detained person is to be informed of the fact that the notification did not occur. Any consequences are left to national law. The right to communicate with consular or diplomatic authorities : this provision confirms the right to communicate with consular authorities. It places a duty on Member States to ensure that all foreign detainees are able to have the consular authorities of their State of nationality informed of the detention if they so wish. Confidentiality : d efence rights are protected by the obligation to ensure that all communications, in whatever form they take, between a suspected and accused person and his lawyer are entirely confidential, with no scope for derogations. Derogations : given the paramount importance of the rights enshrined in this Directive suggests that derogations for Member States should not be possible, in principle. Limited scope for derogations, however, is admitted by the ECtHR jurisprudence as concerns the initial stages of criminal proceedings. Member States may be allowed to derogate from the right of access to a lawyer only in exceptional circumstances, subject to necessity and to procedural safeguards. Any derogation must be justified by compelling reasons pertaining to the urgent need to avert danger for the life or physical integrity of one or more people. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 18 March 2014 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations, on behalf of the European Union, with the Faroe Islands on an Agreement between the European Union and the Faroe Islands associating the Faroe Islands to Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020). Negotiations were concluded and resulted in the attached draft agreement text. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the European Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the common and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds. The general budget of the Union for the financial year 2019 amended the total amount of resources for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI in 2019 by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices and bringing the total amount of commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI for the entire programming period to EUR 4 527 882 072 in current prices. For 2019, the additional resources of EUR 99 573 877 in 2011 prices are funded by the Global Margin for Commitments within the margin of the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020. It is appropriate to provide for specific measures facilitating the implementation of the YEI, due to the advanced stage of the implementation of operational programmes for the 2014-2020 programming period. CONTENT: the proposal aims to adapt the amounts of resources available for economic, social and territorial cohesion, the amount of resources for the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations reflected in Annex VI of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to reflect the increase of the resources of the YEI, in line with the adopted budget for 2019. More specifically, commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI should be increased by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices, bringing the overall amount for 2019 up to EUR 350 million. The proposal also introduces provisions to respond to the co-legislators' request for facilitating measures to ensure the swift programming of the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2019, so as not to hamper the overall implementation progress of the 2014-2020 operational programmes. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposed amendment should not result in additional payment appropriations needs in 2019. For 2020 the budgetary implication should be limited only to additional payment appropriations to cover the annual pre-financing due on the increased YEI resources."
932EP7,"""""Placing on the market and use of biocidal products""""",0.789,0.89,0.0,0.645,0.303,0.843,0.821,0.057,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve the safety of biocidal products used and placed on the market in the European Union and to simplify authorisation procedures. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 98/8/EC establishes a harmonised regulatory framework for the authorisation and the placing on the market of biocidal products, the mutual recognition of these authorisations within the Community and the establishment at Community level of a positive list of active substances that may be used in biocidal products. The review of the implementation of the Directive has indicated that for the evaluation of active substances, the simplified procedures provided for in the Directive, notably for low-risk products (Annex IA to the Directive), have no real effect. It has also indicated that the data requirements and data waiving provisions may be unclear or inconsistently applied. In addition, although product authorisation has not yet started, simplification of the procedures concerning the authorisation of biocidal products in Member States may be beneficial in reducing costs and administrative burden for companies and public authorities alike. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers five main issues requiring action: Scope : including treated materials in the scope of the Directive would significantly increase the costs to industry. However, although the equal treatment of industry and environmental and human health benefits are difficult to quantify, they are likely to be significant; Product authorisation : a combination of the Community authorisation for certain products with the strengthening of the mutual recognition process for other products appears to be the most realistic solution; Data sharing : mandatory data sharing at product authorisation and active substance approval stage implies the highest total cost savings to applicants, possibly the highest number of safer products remaining on the market and the highest number of animals saved; Data requirements : the best option seems to be a combination of data waiving with the use of existing information and a new approach to low risk biocidal products; Fees charged by Member States : a partially harmonised fee structure may encourage the development of more new active substances and the retention of more existing active substances. Another option - specific provisions for SMEs - would make the procedure less costly for SMEs. CONTENT: on 8 October 2008, the Commission submitted a report on the implementation of Directive 98/8/EC and the functioning of the simplified procedures (see COD/1993/0465 under follow-up documents). Based on the conclusions of the report, the present proposal for a revision of Directive 98/8/EC aims to tackle the identified weaknesses of the regulatory framework during the first eight years of its implementation, to improve and update certain elements of the system and to avoid problems anticipated in the future. The main elements of the revision are as follows: Legal form: the Directive is turned into a Regulation. As a result, there will be no need for national transposition measures, which is also expected to ensure more harmonised implementation of the regulatory framework in the Member States. Scope: the scope is extended to biocides in materials that might come into contact with food. With regard to materials containing biocidal products, under the current situation, if an article is treated in the EU, then only a biocidal product that is authorised for that purpose may be used. However, if the article is treated with a biocidal product outside the EU and then imported, there is no control over the substance it may incorporate. This could represent risks for human health or for the environment. In addition, this situation is discriminatory to the EU industry, and could lead to the production of treated articles or materials being moved out of the EU in order to circumvent restrictions on certain substances. As part of the revision of the Biocides Directive, it is proposed that all articles or materials must be treated only with biocidal products authorised for that purpose in at least one Member State . Labelling requirements : these have two objectives: (i) to inform consumers that the article was treated with a biocidal product; and (ii) to alert competent authorities in the Member States and trigger any existing inspection provisions aimed at ensuring compliance. The labelling provisions apply equally to EU and non EU manufacturers. Authorisation: the proposal provides for harmonised procedures for the authorisation of biocidal products. The provisions regarding mutual recognition of authorisations are reworked and clarified, in particular the resolution of disputes between Member States, or between Member States and applicants. Apart from authorisations granted by Member States, a centralised authorisation system is proposed. This will be available for products identified as low-risk - without having to go through a separate evaluation of the active substance first- and for products containing new active substances. The technical and scientific tasks relevant to this centralised system will be carried out by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). In addition, ECHA will undertake the coordination of organisational and technical tasks for the evaluation of all applications for inclusion of active substances in Annex I (the Community positive list for active substances) which were until now attributed to the Commission Joint Research Centre. The simplified procedures involving the current Annex IA and IB are repealed, as very little use has been made of them so far. The simplified procedure involving frame formulations is modified so as to allow, within a group of products belonging to the same frame formulation, the replacement of any non-active ingredient by other non-active ingredients (currently, this is restricted to pigments, dyes, and perfumes). The rules on comparative assessment are also modified: the proposed system comprises a first stage where active substances that still give rise to concern and are listed in Annex I, but are also flagged for substitution. Biocidal products containing these active substances may be compared with others that are available on the market for the same or similar use pattern, and if they present significantly higher risk than the latter, their authorisations are refused or cancelled at national level. Research on animals : the new proposal will also reduce the number of tests on animals. In line with recent policy developments, animal testing may only be carried out once. Following the example of REACH (Community legislation on chemicals), the proposed Regulation shall force undertakings, that make a request for an authorisation, to share the results of their studies on animals, in exchange for equitable compensation. Moreover, tests proving the safety and effectiveness of a biocidal product shall only be required when there is a real need. Data protection : the data protection system is significantly simplified, without cutting back on any acquired rights under the current system. It also grants protection to data submitted after the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I (mainly during product authorisation): these studies are not protected by the current legislation. The proposed data protection system also covers the case of newly generated studies. Data requirements : these are modified: (i) the principle of proposing adaptations to the data requirements is formalised and Member States have to inform and assist the applicants with their adaptation requests; (ii) the grounds for waiving of data provided for in REACH will apply also for the proposed Regulation; (iii) the core data requirements are modified and certain long-term animal studies are only required when necessary. Lastly, the confidentiality provisions are slightly modified and aligned with those of REACH. This is to facilitate their application by ECHA. Specific parallel trade rules : for the purpose of facilitating the movement of biocidal products in the EU territory, the proposal provides for specific parallel trade rules: authorised biocidal products that have the same use, contain the same active substance and have essentially identical composition to products authorised in another Member State may be placed on the market of that other Member State via a simplified administrative procedure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal will have budgetary implications as there is a need to support the European Chemicals Agency (the Agency) in taking up the additional tasks related to the assessment and inclusion of active substances used in biocidal products in Annex I of the Regulation and the centralised authorisation of certain biocidal products. The Agency will receive specific fees from applicants for certain of these activities as well as an annual fee on products centrally authorised by the Community. The revenue from the fees will have to be supplemented by a subsidy from the Community."
4321EP7,"""""Port State control""""",0.86,0.96,0.982,0.387,0.606,0.88,0.908,0.857,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"BACKGROUND: on 23 February 2006, the International Labour Organisation adopted the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), desiring to create a single, coherent instrument embodying as far as possible all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour Conventions and Recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions. The MLC, adopted in 2006, provides comprehensive rights and protection at work for all seafarers regardless of their nationality and the flag of the ship. It aims to both achieve decent working conditions for seafarers and secure fair competition for quality shipowners. It sets out seafarers' rights to decent conditions of work on a wide range of subjects, and has been designed to be globally applicable, easily understandable, updatable and uniformly enforced. Council Decision 2007/431/EC has authorised the Member States to ratify the Convention. Member States should ratify it as soon as possible. Port State control is regulated at EU level by Directive 2009/16/EC, which aims at helping to drastically reduce substandard shipping. In addition, Directive 2009/13/EC implements certain standards of the MLC within Union law. While Directive 2009/16/EC already refers to the MLC and to ILO standards, it needs to be updated to take into account the new documents and arrangements brought in by the MLC. This initiative is part of the EU policy on the maritime professions. It follows from the Communication entitled “Strategic goals and recommendations for the EU's maritime transport policy until 2018”, and the White Paper on the Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system, which highlights the importance of a social agenda for the maritime transport. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal for a directive concerning the flag State responsibilities for the enforcement of Directive 2009/13/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a full public consultation offered an opportunity for Member States and stakeholders to express their views in June 2011. There was a general consensus on the need for updating the legislation related to flag State and port State in order to enforce the MLC requirements. The specific positive effects which were underlined consisted of reinforcing maritime safety, improving quality shipping, making the conditions of competition fairer between EU and non EU operators and between EU and non EU flags. Stakeholders also mentioned the better job quality for all seafarers. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) TFEU. CONTENT : the proposal aims to amend the port State control Directive in order to: include the maritime labour certificate and the declaration of maritime labour compliance among the documents to be checked by inspectors; extend the scope of inspections to new items (for ex, the existence of an adequate labour contract signed by both parties for each seafarer with the required clauses in the contract); extend the scope of investigation in case of complaints and provide the adequate procedure. Further to Joint Political Declarations, the Commission is now considering the need for explanatory documents on a case by case basis. By virtue of the principle of proportionality, explanatory documents have not been deemed justified in the present proposal since it modifies only a limited number of legal obligations of an existing directive. Thus, the proposal does not include the recital on explanatory documents. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
3631EP7,"""""European Refugee Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals""""",0.702,0.828,0.965,0.323,0.273,0.867,0.836,0.771,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to increase the co-financing rate of the European Refugee Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals for certain Member States experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, and amending Decision No 573/2007/EC, Decision No 575/2007/EC and Council Decision 2007/435/EC. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision No 573/2007/EC established the European Refugee Fund , Decision No 575/2007/EC established the European Return Fund and Council Decision 2007/435/EC established the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals , as part of the General programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’. These Funds provide for different Union co-financing rates for actions supported by the Funds. The unprecedented global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability, provoking a marked deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several Member States. Some Member States are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, particularly with respect to their financial and economic stability, leading to deterioration in their deficit and debt positions and threatening economic growth heightened by the international economic and financial environment. Ensuring the smooth implementation of programmes adopted under the four Funds established as part of the General Programme on ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ (‘the Funds’), is of particular importance as a means of injecting funds into the economy. To make European Union funding easier to manage in the area of migration, asylum and external borders and to improve the availability of funding for the Member States to implement their annual programmes under the Funds, it is necessary, on a temporary basis and without prejudice to the 2014-2020 programming period, to arrange for an increase in the Union co-financing rate under the Funds, by an amount corresponding to twenty percentage points above the co-financing rates currently applicable, for Member States experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal regarding a similar amendment of the External Borders Fund (please see COD/2012/0253 ). LEGAL BASIS: Articles 78(2) and Article 79(2) and (4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no consultation of external stakeholders. The proposal will allow the Commission to apply higher co-financing rates for the countries benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. CONTENT: in order to ensure that Member States benefiting from a financial support mechanism continue to implement the programmes adopted under the Funds on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the proposal contains provisions that would allow the Commission to increase the Union co-financing rate for these countries, for the period during which they benefit from financial assistance provided by one of the support mechanisms under any funding instruments. This will provide additional financial resources to the Member States and will make it easier to continue implementing the programmes on the ground. The Funds’ annual national allocation pursuant to the basic acts will remain unchanged while national co-financing will be reduced accordingly. Ongoing annual programmes will need to be revised to reflect the changes resulting from the application of the increased Union co-financing rate. The proposal makes provision for the following amendments: Amendment of Article 14 and Article 21(3) of Decision No 573/2007/EC: Article 14 currently provides that the Union co-financing rate for supported actions does not in principle exceed 50% (and that this Union co-financing rate may be increased to 75% if the Member State in question is covered by the Cohesion Fund). Under this proposal, it is proposed that the Union contribution could to be increased by 20 percentage points, if the Member State satisfies one of the following conditions at the time at which they submit their draft annual programme: i) Article 21(3) of Decision No 573/2007/EC provides that financial assistance from the European Refugee Fund for emergency measures shall not exceed 80% of the cost of each measure. The Commission proposes to allow the Union co-financing rate applicable to the European Refugee Fund programmes of the Member States concerned to be increased by 20 percentage points, provided they are benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. Amendment of Article 15 of Decision No 575/2007/EC establishing the European Return Fund and amendment of Article 13 of Council Decision 2007/435/EC establishing the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007 to 2013 have identical content to Article 14 of Decision No 573/2007/EC. The proposal contains a similar provision increasing the Union co-financing rate by 20 percentage points. Annual programme : once a decision granting financial assistance to a Member State under one of the support mechanisms has been taken, the Member State may submit to the Commission either a draft annual programme or a draft revised annual programme applying the increased Union co-financing rate. However, once an action of a specific annual programme has been co-financed at the increased Union co-financing rate, it remains so until the end of the eligibility period of the related annual programme whether or not the Member State still benefits from one of the support mechanisms. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modifications are proposed to the maximum amounts of the Funds' financing provided for in the annual programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. The proposal states that it shows the Commission's willingness to assist Member States in their efforts to deal with the financial crisis. The amendments will provide the Member States concerned with the necessary funds to support projects and economic recovery."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were opened on 5 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 20 November 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andthe United Arab Emirates on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the United Arab Emirates when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of the United Arab Emirates to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that the United Arab Emirates may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also the United Arab Emirates remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and the United Arab Emirates reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of the United Arab Emirates to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, was signed in Luxemburg on 29 April 2008. It will enter into force when the Parties notify each other that their respective ratification procedures have been completed. The Interim Agreement (IA) between the same parties, signed on the same date to allow the early application of trade and trade-related provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), entered into force on 1 February 2010. With the aim of the correct and smooth application of the IA, an Implementing Regulation is proposed, to lay down rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of these Agreements, as has been done for previous SAAs and Interim Agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to lay down rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Interim Agreement, as well as the procedures for the adoption of detailed rules of implementation. Since the trade and trade-related provisions of these instruments are to a very large extent identical, this Regulation should also apply to the implementation of the SAA after its entry into force. Scope of the application measures : the SAA and the IA stipulate that certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Serbia may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. This proposal lays down provisions regulating the management of these tariff quotas. Implementation powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Interim Agreement and the SAA, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Given that the implementing measures form part of the common commercial policy, the examination procedure should be used for their adoption. In certain circumstances defined in the proposal, the Commission should adopt immediately such implementing acts. Other technical provisions relating to the implementation of trade defence measures : Where trade defence measures become necessary, they should be adopted in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 on the common rules for imports, Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 establishing common rules for exports, Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community. Notification of fraud and failure to provide administrative cooperation : where a Member State provides information to the Commission on a possible fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant community legislation shall apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries This Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: f or the past 50 years the EU has simultaneously pursued integration and enlargement, increasing from 6 to the present 27 Member States and from a population of less than 200 million to more than 500 million people. A review, five years after the fifth enlargement of the EU in 2004, concluded that: the latest enlargements had brought greater prosperity for all EU citizens and made Europe a stronger player in the world economy. Currently, the EU is dealing with 5 candidate countries (Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey) and 4 potential candidates (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia as well as Kosovo). By 2014, only Croatia is foreseen to become a Member State. Socio-economic indicators show that, with the exception of Iceland, enlargement countries are still well below the EU average and even below the level of the weakest Member States. This low level of socio-economic development calls for substantial investments to bring these countries closer to EU standards and allow them to take on board the obligations of membership and to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market. In addition, the countries in the Western Balkans are still relatively young states where political stability and the full establishment of the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and good governance — all fundamental values of the EU — still need to be strengthened. These countries cannot sustain alone all the efforts and cost of meeting the criteria for joining the EU. Technical and financial assistance to the Enlargement countries is currently provided through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) which will expire at the end of 2013. With a view to future accessions, the EU should continue to offer candidate countries and potential candidates technical and financial assistance to overcome their difficult situation and develop sustainably by concentrating on the following elements: promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe; continue to pursue the general policy objective of supporting candidate countries and potential candidates in their preparations for EU membership and the progressive alignment of their institutions and economies with the standards and policies of the European Union; strengthen the coherence between the financial assistance and the overall progress made in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy; operate more flexibly and to leverage more funds from other donors or the private sector by using innovative financing instruments, pursue simplification and reduction of the administrative burden linked to managing the financial assistance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined three options: Sub-option 2.1 : ‘Reduce scope and keep implementation arrangements’, focusing on the necessary legal and institutional changes needed to comply with the accession criteria, without committing any significant funds for co-financing public investment for socio-economic development. Sub-option 2.2 : ‘Keep the component structure and add more focus on investments’ in order to increase the socio-economic impact in the beneficiary countries and to speed up their preparation for managing structural, cohesion and rural development funds. Sub-option 2.3 : ‘Maintain the scope and adjust implementation arrangements’, covering both compliance with the accession criteria and support for socio-economic development. In addition, adjust aspects of the current IPA set-up and implementation modalities. The improved modalities for delivering assistance under option 2.3, by increasing its focus, efficiency, effectiveness, leverage and impact, were assessed as likely to have overall a more positive impact than the increased investments in socio-economic development under option 2.2. Option 2.3 is therefore the preferred option. CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, the Commission proposes to establish an Instrument for Pre–accession Assistance (‘IPA’) aims to support candidate countries and potential candidates listed in the Annex in implementing the political, institutional, legal, administrative, social and economic reforms required to bring the countries closer to Union values and to progressively align to Union rules, standards, policies and practices with a view to Union membership. Specific objectives : assistance under this Regulation shall pursue the following specific objectives according to the needs of each beneficiary country and their individual enlargement agenda: Support for political reforms , inter alia: (i). strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law, including its implementation; (ii). promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, enhanced respect for minority rights, promotion of gender equality, non-discrimination and freedom of the press, and promotion of good neighbourly relations; (iii). the fight against corruption and organised crime; (iv). public administration reform and good governance; (v). the development of civil society and social dialogue; (vi). reconciliation, peace building and confidence building measures; Support for economic, social and territorial development , with a view to a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, inter alia through: (i). the achievement of Union standards in the economy and economic governance; (ii) economic reforms necessary to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union, while pursuing economic, social and environmental goals; (iii). fostering employment and developing human capital; (iv). social and economic inclusion, in particular of minorities and vulnerable groups; (v). development of physical capital, the improvement of connections with Union and regional networks; Strengthening of the ability of beneficiary countries to fulfil the obligations stemming from membership by supporting progressive alignment with and adoption, implementation and enforcement of the acquis communautaire, structural, cohesion, agricultural and rural development funds and policies of the Union. Regional integration and territorial cooperation involving beneficiary countries, Member States and, where appropriate, third countries within the scope of Regulation establishing a European Neighbourhood Instrument. Progress towards achievement of the specific objectives set out above shall be assessed through indicators laid down in the proposal. The indicators shall be used for monitoring, evaluation and review of performance, as appropriate. Countries concerned: Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Iceland Kosovo Montenegro Serbia Turkey The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Strategic planning T he delivery of assistance will be made more coherent, strategic and result-oriented , by: Addressing policy areas through comprehensive multi-annual country (and multi-beneficiary) strategy papers reflecting the political priorities of the Enlargement Strategy and covering, for each policy area, all necessary institution building, acquis compliance and investment actions. The scope will be based on a needs assessment and will be adapted to the country context. Reinforcing (co-)financing of agreed sector strategies contributing to the policy objectives, as opposed to individual projects, thus moving away from purely grantfinanced projects and increasing the share of assistance funded through support at sector level (including sector budget support for selected policy areas based on effectively targeted conditionalities). Nevertheless, support for acquis compliance will remain available through project support or other implementation modalities such as dedicated facilities, when not covered by overarching sector strategies. More systematic multi-annual programming also for policy objectives pursued by transition and institution-building assistance (e.g. public administration reform; reform of justice systems, etc.), supporting effective implementation of the related sector strategies and ultimately attainment of the related objectives. Making financial assistance more directly conditional on improved governance and growing ownership by the beneficiary countries. Elements of flexibility will be introduced to cater for emerging needs and give incentives to improve performance. The delivery of assistance will be made more flexible and tailored to address needs, by : Allowing un-differentiated access to assistance (irrespective of candidate or potential candidate status), albeit with a different scope or intensity, on the basis of needs and technical and administrative capacity. The needs of the beneficiary countries would be the starting point for determining the sectors/policy areas for assistance. Envisaging a more progressive, phased approach to the management of financial assistance, whereby management would be by the Commission or by the beneficiary country, with or without ex-ante controls by the Commission, depending on accession status/perspective, sector/policy area of assistance, and administrative, technical and management capacity. The creation of management structures and procedures mirroring those that need to be in place post-accession would continue to be the aim in relevant sectors in preparation for accession. Linking progress along different management phases to political priorities , as reflected in progress reports, the achievement of negotiation benchmarks or the track record in implementing the Association Agreements. Increasing flexibility between priorities for a more result-oriented delivery of the assistance , allowing allocations to be transferred between policy areas, with the possibility to carry over funds from one year to another, where allowed by the new Financial Regulation. Indicative programming : the proposal also envisages that strategic decisions on the allocation of assistance are made through comprehensive country and multi-country strategy papers covering the full period of the new financial framework (2014-2020) and reviewed once at mid-term, replacing the current system of three-year rolling indicative planning documents revised each year. This will reduce, for all stakeholders involved, the administrative burden related to the yearly review of each document and possible ensuing revisions. Similarly, less administration for all and quicker delivery of assistance will follow from introducing multi-annual programming for transition and capacity-building assistance as well. Simplified implementation : a priority for the Commission in this new Regulation, as in other programmes under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate Union assistance to beneficiary countries and regions, civil society organisations, SMEs, etc. This proposal pursues simplification primarily by streamlining the component structure around principal policy areas. This translates into simplification of the legislative framework for the instrument and the future implementing rules, with streamlined provisions. Simplification and flexible procedures in the implementation of the new Regulation, will allow swifter adoption of implementing measures and delivery of EU assistance. In implementing this Regulation, the Commission will use the simplified procedures provided for in the new Financial Regulation. Different Commission services will remain responsible for managing and implementing the assistance in the different policy areas. However, coordination, communication and implementation on the ground will be further improved through simplification of a number of aspects, including closer joint monitoring of the progress of implementation in the beneficiary countries and fewer processes for accreditation and conferral of management powers. Beneficiary’s change of status : it will no longer be necessary to go through a cumbersome procedure to reflect a beneficiary’s change of status, thus reducing the gap between the political decisions on financial assistance and implementation on the ground. Similarly, should a new country become a potential candidate for EU accession, the procedural requirements for including that country among the beneficiaries of assistance would be considerably simplified. Coherence and complementarity : increasing the coherence of action by the Commission should also substantially reduce the cost and burden of coordination incurred by beneficiary countries, on account of the different communication channels and procedures used by the Commission. Follow-up and evaluation : detailed provisions on joint monitoring and the accreditation processes will be set out in separate implementing rules. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in its Communication on ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’, the European Commission proposed to allocate an amount of EUR 14 110 100 000 (current prices) to the new Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: considering that the discretionary policy decisions on the status of applicant countries should be taken at another level, it is proposed that amendments made to the list of beneficiary countries in Annex to the proposed Regulation to reflect such decisions should be adopted by way of a delegated act in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, since such amendments will not actually affect an essential element of the Regulation. It is also proposed that the Commission should be conferred delegated powers to adopt detailed rules establishing uniform conditions for implementing the proposed Regulation, in particular as regards management structures and procedures. Such rules are needed to complement the common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union's instruments for external action established by the Common Implementing Regulation. They should take into account the lessons learnt from the management and implementation of past pre-accession assistance and be adapted to the evolution of the situation in the beneficiary countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in principle, the details of the implementation of the landing obligation are to be defined in regional multi-annual management plans adopted through codecision. Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, in the absence of multiannual plans or management plans, the Commission may adopt discard plans on a temporary basis and for a period of no more than three years. Experience has demonstrated that the preparation and adoption of multiannual or management plans that include discard plans takes longer than was envisaged at the time of the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The first Commission delegated regulations establishing discard plans entered into force on the 1 January 2015 and are expiring at the end of 2017. To date, only the Baltic multiannual plan is in place, whereas two Commission proposals for a multiannual plan for demersals in the North Sea and for small pelagics in the Adriatic are currently under negotiation between the co-legislators. It is therefore appropriate to set the period for which the Commission may adopt discard plans in the absence of multiannual or management plans. CONTENT: the proposal contains only one substantive provision, which amends Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 in order to temporarily extend the Commission's power to adopt discard plans by means of delegated acts for an additional period of three years, provided that there are no multi-annual plans in place for the sea basins concerned."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lays down the list of third countries whose national must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (“negative list”) and those whose national are exempt from that requirement (“positive list”). The determination of those third countries or territories whose citizens are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating, among other things, to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the European Union's external relations with third countries or territories. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity, and particular attention is paid to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries or territories concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries or territories, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed regularly. The present review of the Regulation aims at: ensure that the composition of the lists of third countries and territories complies with the criteria set out in recital 5 of the Regulation, in particular as regards the illegal immigration and public policy criteria and the external relations criterion, and transferring countries from one annex to another as appropriate; ensure that, in accordance with Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU, the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country or territory citizen is to be subject to or exempt from the visa requirement. As a result, a new modified version of Regulation (EC) No 239/2001 is proposed in order to include a certain number of states in the Regulation’s positive and negative lists. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU. CONTENT: in accordance with the approach followed in the context of previous amendments to Regulation (EC) No. 539/2001, it is proposed to: transfer Taiwan to the positive list: despite the fact that the EU does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state and has no diplomatic or formal relations with Taiwan, the EU has developed regular contacts and cooperation in a number of areas with the Taiwanese authorities. As a result, the EU is the largest foreign investor in Taiwan. Upon analysis, it became apparent that transferring Taiwan to the positive list would reinforce regional coherence as the EU grants visa free regime to other countries and entities of the region. As regards migration, the risk of illegal immigration from Taiwan is very low On that basis, imposing a visa requirement on the nationals of Taiwan is no longer justified; transfer of the Northern Mariana Islands to the positive list : the Northern Mariana Islands are a commonwealth in political union with the United States of America, and the head of the state of Northern Mariana is the president of the United States. The citizens of the Islands have US passports. Following from the above information, the reference to the Northern Mariana Islands should be deleted from Annex I. This will entail that the citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands, as US nationals, enjoy visa-free travel. Lastly, it should be noted that the draft Regulation proposes a new Part 4 under Annex II : this is entitled “Entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as States by at least one Member State,” and the list is comprised of Taiwan. BUDGETARY IMPACT : the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 on general food law (the GFL Regulation) established the principle of risk analysis as a general principle in EU food law. Risk assessment at EU level is carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), independently of the risk management function, which is entrusted to the EU institutions, and more particularly to the Commission. The GFL Fitness Check and recent public debates have shown that certain aspects of the current legislative framework need to be addressed. Citizens demand that the risk assessment process in the area of food law (and the decision-making based on it) be more transparent. Transparency and confidentiality rules currently vary depending on the sub-area of regulation concerned. Many stakeholders and citizens complain that the EFSA’s evaluations of authorisation applications are essentially based on studies, data and information generated (and paid for) by the applicant for authorisation. Risk communication was also found not to be effective enough. As announced in the Communication replying to the European Citizens’ Initiative “Ban glyphosate and protect people and the environment from toxic pesticides”, this proposal is a targeted revision of the GFL Regulation (and other measures adopted in that framework) in order to improve transparency in risk assessment, reliability, objectivity and independence of studies used by EFSA in its risk assessment, risk communication, and governance of EFSA. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend not only the GFL Regulation but also eight additional sectoral legislative acts relating to the food chain. The main objectives of the proposed amendments are: ensure greater transparency by ensuring that scientists and citizens have access to key safety related information being assessed by EFSA at an early stage in the risk assessment. All supporting data and information relating to applications for authorisation are to be made public by EFSA upon receipt, including additional information, with the exception of information for which confidentiality is duly justified; improve citizens’ confidence in the credibility of scientific studies by: i. establishing a Union register of commissioned studies on substances subject to a food law authorisation system, to be managed by EFSA; the register of commissioned studies will have a positive impact on the objectivity of the evidence submitted by industry since it will provide additional guarantee that applicants submit all studies they have performed on a substance whatever their results; ii. providing a pre-submission procedure, by which EFSA may provide advice to an applicant, such advice being made public; iii. providing that at the stage of submission of authorisation application, when all studies are made public according to the new provisions on transparency, a consultation of third parties will be launched with the aim to identify whether other relevant scientific data or studies are available; iv. providing for controls and audits by Commission inspectors in relation to studies; v. introducing the possibility for the Commission to request EFSA to commission studies in exceptional circumstances (e.g. controversies) for the purpose of verification. better involving Members States in EFSA’s governance structure and scientific panels without touching on its independence : the proposal aligns the composition of EFSA’s Management Board with the Common Approach on decentralised agencies by including representatives of all Member States. It will also increase the involvement of Member States in the nomination process of Panels’ members. The existing strict criteria on independence are maintained and specific provisions require Member States to set up specific measures ensuring that the experts have concrete means to act independently as required by the proposal. strengthen risk communication : the proposal ensures a develop a comprehensive and effective risk communication strategy, involving the Commission, Member States and the EFSA throughout the risk analysis process, combined with open dialogue amongst all interested parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission considers that by strengthening the EFSA’s governance and making risk assessment more sustainable, EFSA will continue to play a fundamental role in the Union food safety system and to contribute to the health and well-being of Union citizens and to an innovative and competitive Union agri-food industry. To address these issues, the Commission has come up with a wide ranging and ambitious proposal requiring a significant increase in the resources available to the EFSA to enable it to discharge its existing and proposed new responsibilities. Member States that provide the EFSA with expertise also need to receive more compensation. The impact on EFSA's expenditure is estimated at EUR 256.270 million for the period 2020-2024 (staff costs: EUR 56.276 million; operational expenditure: EUR 199.994 million)."

The evaluation confirmed that the Directive is the relevant tool to ensure the high quality of the water consumed in the EU, because its basic purpose is to enforce drinking water monitoring and ensure that Member States restore required water quality levels in case of issues. However, the evaluation identified four areas with room for improvement: the list of parameters; the use of the risk-based approach; increased transparency on water-related issues and giving consumers access to up-to date information; and materials in contact with drinking water. The revision is part of the plan to transition to a circular economy. It will help Member States manage drinking water in a resource-efficient and sustainable manner, thereby helping to reduce energy use and unnecessary water loss. It will also help reduce the number of plastic bottles used by improving people’s confidence in tap water. The proposal is fully in line with the Agenda 2030, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 6 and the aims of the Paris Agreement on climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a combination of the preferred options will ensure: high quality drinking water for everyone in the EU ; a more modern approach to monitoring, by using the risk-based approach for both large and small water suppliers; the modernisation, and hence simplification, of reporting provisions; up-to-date and relevant information for consumers; improved access to water, and the provision of access to water for vulnerable and marginalised groups. The costs and the impacts of the proposal will be between EUR 5.9 billion and EUR 7.3 billion. These costs will mainly be borne by water operators. Consumers would see a very marginal increase in their household costs. However, this does not risk making drinking water unaffordable and could be offset by people drinking tap water rather than bottled water. CONTENT: the proposal is a recast of Directive 98/83/EC, which was amended in 2003, 2009 and 2015. Its objective is to improve the quality of and access to drinking water as well as to provide more comprehensive information to citizens. The main elements are: List of parameters set out in Annex : the proposal incorporates the vast majority of parameters and values ​​recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), while suggesting a different approach for a small number of parameters. The Commission proposes, for example to: (i) retain benzene, cyanide, 1,2-dichloroethane, mercury, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ; (ii) retain the initial values for antimony, boron and selenium ;(iii) set the value for chlorate and chlorite at the stricter level of 0.25 mg/l; (iv) to place three endocrine disrupting compounds (beta-estradiol; nonylphenol; and bisphenol A) into the Directive on the basis of the precautionary principle; (v) reducing the value of chromium by 50 % to 25 µg/l after a transition period of 10 years after the entry into force of the Directive. Risk-based approach : with the new risk-based approach to safety, compliance checks would focus more on those cases where risks are higher. The proposal introduces obligations related to hazard assessment related to bodies of water used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption, introduces obligations related to carrying out a supply risk assessment by the water supplier, and introduces obligations related to carrying out risk assessments of domestic distribution. Access to drinking water for all citizens, especially for vulnerable and marginalised groups : concretely, this means: (i) informing people who do not have access to drinking water about the possibilities of connection,( ii) encouraging the use of tap water in public buildings and restaurants, (iii) ensuring the availability of equipment allowing free access to tap water in most cities, (iv) quickly informing vulnerable people about the quality of available water and give them the necessary sanitary advice on it. Public information : the proposal aims to: (i) ensure the availability of specified online information on the quality and supply of drinking water and (ii) provide additional specific information directly to consumers (for example on invoices), such as the volumes consumed as well as the detail of the tariff(s) and the cost structure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal should be implemented under the existing allocations for the Commission and the European Environmental Agency and no additional resources are needed. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 for the conservation of fishery through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound confers powers upon the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: in the context of the alignment of Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 to the new rules of the TFEU, powers currently conferred on the Commission by that Regulation have been reclassified into delegated measures and implementing measures. Delegated acts: the Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend the technical specifications of two parts of the fishing gears improving selectivity: namely the Bacoma type exit window and the netting in the cod-end and extension piece being turned 90° (T90 trawl). Implementing acts: implementing powers will be conferred on the Commission in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 as regards measures taken by Member States which apply only to fishing vessels flying their flag. Lastly, powers to adopt detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 are no longer required. The provision conferring those powers should therefore be deleted. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."
5529EP7,"""""Procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors""""",0.754,0.857,0.912,0.419,0.273,0.94,0.903,0.371,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to modernise existing public procurement legislation in order to make it better suited to deal with the evolving political, social and economic context. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: p ublic procurement plays an important role in the overall economic performance of the European Union. In Europe, public authorities spend around 18 % of GDP on supplies, works and services. Given the volume of purchases, public procurement can be used as a powerful lever for achieving a Single Market fostering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. A comprehensive economic evaluation has shown that the public procurement Directives have achieved their objectives to a considerable extent. They have resulted in greater transparency and higher levels of competition while achieving measurable savings through lower prices. The Commission published on 27 January 2011 a Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy — Towards a more efficient European Procurement Market launching a broad public consultation on options for legislative changes to make the award of contracts easier and more flexible and enable public contracts to be put to better use in support of other policies. A very large majority of stakeholders appreciated the initiative of the Commission to review the current public procurement policy. They voiced demand for a review of the public procurement directives to simplify the rules, increase their efficiency and effectiveness and make them better suited to deal with the evolving political, social and economic context. This proposal has two complementary objectives: Increase the efficiency of public spending to ensure the best possible procurement outcomes in terms of value for money. This implies in particular a simplification and flexibilisation of the existing public procurement rules. Streamlined, more efficient procedures will benefit all economic operators and facilitate the participation of SMEs and cross-border bidders. Allow procurers to make better use of public procurement in support of common societal goals such as protection of the environment, higher resource and energy efficiency, combating climate change, promoting innovation, employment and social inclusion and ensuring the best possible conditions for the provision of high quality social services. This initiative implements the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiatives on a Digital Agenda for Europe, the Innovation Union, an Integrated Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, Energy 2020 and a Resource Efficient Europe. It also implements the Single Market Act, in particular its twelfth key action ‘Revised and Modernised Public Procurement Legislative Framework’. Together with the proposed new utilities Directive, the proposal will replace Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC as the core elements of the European Union public procurement legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment and its executive summary give an overview of the different options for each of the five groups of basic problems (administrative organisation, scope, procedures, strategic procurement and access to procurement markets). Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the different options, a package of preferred options was identified that should optimise the synergies between the different solutions allowing savings due to one type of action to neutralise related costs caused by another (e.g. possible increased procedural requirements caused by strategic procurement actions could partially be neutralised by savings related to the improved design of procurement procedures). These preferred options form the basis of the present proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1), Article 62 and Article 114 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the main axes of the proposal are as follows: (1) Simplification and flexibilisation of procurement procedures Clarification of scope : the basic concept of “procurement” which appears also in the title of the proposed Directive has been newly introduced in order to better determine the scope and purpose of procurement law and to facilitate the application of the thresholds. The definitions of certain key notions determining the scope of the Directive (such as body governed by public law, public works and service contracts, mixed contracts) have been revised in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice; the notion of special or exclusive rights is central to the definition of the scope of this Directive, since entities which are neither contracting authorities not public undertakings within the meaning of this Directive are subject to this Directive only to the extent that they exercise one of the activities covered on the basis of such rights. It is therefore appropriate to clarify that rights which have been granted by means of a procedure in which adequate publicity has been ensured and where the granting of those rights was based on objective criteria, notably pursuant to Union legislation, do not constitute special or exclusive rights for the purposes of this Directive; the traditional distinction between so-called priority and non-priority services (“A” and “B” services) will be abolished. The results of the evaluation have shown that it is no longer justified to restrict the full application of procurement law to a limited group of services. However, it became also clear that the regular procurement regime is not adapted to social services which need a specific set of rules; the scope in terms of sectors covered remains largely unchanged. However, procurement made for the purpose of exploring oil and gas has been withdrawn from the scope as that sector has been found to be subject to such competitive pressure that the procurement discipline brought about by the Directive is no longer needed. Toolbox approach : Member State systems will provide the three basic forms of procedure which already exist under current Directives: open and restricted procedures as well as negotiated procedures with prior call for competition. They may, in addition, foresee either as standard procedure or subject to certain conditions the innovation partnership, a new form of procedure for innovative procurement; contracting entities will furthermore have at their disposal a set of six specific procurement techniques and tools intended for aggregated and electronic procurement: framework agreements, dynamic purchasing systems, electronic auctions, electronic catalogues, central purchasing bodies and joint procurement. Compared to the existing Directive, those tools have been improved and clarified with a view to facilitating e-procurement. Promotion of e-procurement: the proposal provides for the mandatory transmission of notices in electronic form, the mandatory electronic availability of the procurement documents and imposes the switch to fully electronic communication, in particular e-submission, in all procurement procedures within a transition period of two years. Modernisation of procedures : time-limits for participations and submission of offers have been shortened . The distinction between selection of tenderers and award of the contract which is often a source of errors and misunderstandings has been made more flexible, allowing contracting entities to decide on the most practical sequencing by examining award criteria before selection criteria and to take into account the organisation and quality of the staff assigned to performing the contract as an award criterion; the procedure for exemption of contracts awarded in sufficiently competitive markets (the current “Article 30 decisions”) has been simplified and streamlined. A number of exemptions, in particular the intra-group and joint venture exemptions which are important in practice have also been reviewed and clarified; the modification of contracts during their term has become an increasingly relevant and problematic issue for practitioners. A specific provision on modification of contracts takes up the basic solutions developed by case-law and provides a pragmatic solution for dealing with unforeseen circumstances requiring an adaption of a public contract during its term. (2) Strategic use of public procurement in response to new challenges: the proposed Directive is based on enabling approach providing contracting authorities with the instruments needed to contribute to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategic goals by using their purchasing power to procure goods and services that foster innovation, respect the environment and combat climate change while improving employment, public health and social conditions. Life-cycle costing : the proposal gives purchasers the possibility to base their award decisions on life-cycle costs of the products, services or works to be purchased. Production process : contracting entities may refer to all factors directly linked to the production process in the technical specifications and in the award criteria, as long as they refer to aspects of the production process which are closely related to the specific production or provision of the good or service purchased. This excludes requirements that are not related to the process of producing the products, works or services covered by the procurement, such as a general corporate social responsibility requirement covering the whole operation of the contractor. Labels: contracting entities may require that works, supplies or services bear specific labels certifying environmental, social or other characteristics, provided that they accept also equivalent labels. Sanctioning violations of mandatory social, labour or environmental law : under the proposed Directive, a contracting authority can exclude economic operators from the procedure, if it identifies infringements of obligations established by Union legislation in the field of social, labour or environmental law or of international labour law provisions. Social services : the services have, by their very nature, only a very limited cross-border dimension. Member States should therefore have large discretion to organise the choice of service providers. The proposal takes account of this by providing a specific regime for public contracts for these services, with a higher threshold of EUR 1 000 000 and imposing only the respect of basic principles of transparency and equal treatment. Innovation : the proposal provides for this purpose the innovation partnership, a new special procedure for the development and subsequent purchase of new, innovative products, works and services, provided they can be delivered to agreed performance levels and costs. (3) Better access to the market for SMEs and Start-ups Simplification of information obligations : it is foreseen that contracting entities may apply the selection criteria provided for in the proposed Directive on public procurement and that, where they do, they are then obliged to apply the provisions concerning notably the ceiling to requirements on minimum turnover as well as the provisions on in particular self-certification. Better access to framework agreements : under the current Directives, there is no limitation to the duration of framework agreements concluded in the utilities sectors. This can lead to market foreclosure. The proposal limits the duration to four years (except in duly justified circumstances). Direct payment of subcontractors : Member State can provide that subcontractors may request for direct payment by the contracting authority of supplies, works and services provided to the main contractor in the context of the contract performance. (4) Sound procedures Conflicts of interest : the proposal contains a specific provision on conflicts of interest covering actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest situations affecting staff members of the contracting authority or of procurement service providers intervening in the procedure and members of the contracting authority’s management who may influence the outcome of a procurement procedure even if they are not formally involved in it. Illicit conduct : the proposal contains a specific provision against illicit behaviour by candidates and tenderers, such as attempts to improperly influence the decision-making process or entering into agreements with other participants to manipulate the outcome of the procedure have to be excluded from the procedure. Unfair advantages : the proposal contains a specific provision on safeguards against undue preference in favour of participants who have advised the contracting authority or been involved in the preparation of the procedure. (5) Governance National oversight bodies : the proposal provides that Member States designate a single national authority in charge of monitoring, implementation and control of public procurement. Knowledge centres : the proposal obliges therefore Member States to provide support structures offering legal and economic advice, guidance, training and assistance in preparing and conducting procurement procedures. To reinforce the fight against corruption and favouritism, contracting authorities will be obliged to transmit the text of concluded contracts to the oversight body, which will thus be able to scrutinize these contracts for suspicious patterns, and give access to these documents to interested persons to the extent that legitimate public or private interests are not jeopardized. Administrative cooperation : the proposal provides also for effective cooperation allowing national oversight bodies to share information and best practices and to cooperate through the Internal Market Information System (IMI). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: during the refugee crisis of 2015 and 2016, the EU budget has played a decisive role in managing flows of asylum seekers and migrants. The European migration agenda adopted in May 2015 stressed the need for a consistent common policy to restore confidence in the Union’s ability to combine European and national efforts to address migration issues. In October 2017, the European Council reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive approach to managing migration flows, aimed at restoring control of external borders and reducing irregular arrivals and deaths at sea. Drawing on the lessons from the past, the Commission, in its proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, proposed to significantly increase the share of the overall EU budget devoted to migration and external border management by more than 2.6 times, including an increase in the funding allocated to decentralised bodies in this policy area. The renewed Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF) shall build on the results and investments made with the support of previous funds: the European Refugee Fund, the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals, the European Return Fund, and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for the period 2014-2020. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the asylum and migration fund for the period 2021-2027. Its scope is largely inspired by the current AMIF Regulation, while taking into account new strategic developments and the mandates of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the future European Union Agency for Asylum. The Fund shall continue to support the EU's overall policies in the field of migration, integration and return, such as support to: strengthen and develop the Common European Asylum System (including its external dimension); promote solidarity and shared responsibility between Member States, in particular towards those States most affected by flows of migrants and asylum seekers; support legal migration to Member States and encourage the development of immigration strategies that respect the integration process of third-country nationals; support capacity building in Member States and promote fair and effective return strategies as well as the development of partnerships and cooperation with third countries. Support to Member States : in addition to a basic amount of EUR 5 million allocated to Member States at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of Member States shall be allocated based on a distribution key reflecting the needs and pressures experienced by Member States in the area of integration. It is proposed to give 30% weighting to the area of asylum, 30% to the area of legal migration and integration and 40% to the area of countering irregular migration including returns. The Commission shall carry out a mid-term and a retrospective evaluation of this Regulation, including the actions implemented under the fund. A mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. The remaining 40 % should be managed through a thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for the support for specific actions, providing additional funding for dedicated actions of high EU added value. Specific attention shall be put on promoting effective returns; support for resettlement and the solidarity and responsibility efforts between the Member States. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the fund for the period 2021-2027 shall be EUR 10.41 billion in current prices. The financial resources shall be used as follows: EUR 4.16 billion for the thematic mechanism for specific actions to Member States, projects with a European dimension, and to address urgent needs. It should be noted that the Commission proposal concerning the multiannual financial framework provides for EUR 865 million (in current prices) to the relevant decentralised agencies for the period 2021-2027."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation This Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal for a Partnership Instrument replaces the financing Instrument for Cooperation with Industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI), which came into force in 2007, and which has been the EU’s main vehicle for collaboration with developed countries. The ICI has proved an effective toolbox for providing a differentiated and appropriate response to widen and deepen the cooperation with 17 countries (industrialised countries and high-income territories in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and the Gulf region). It has been recently extended to developing countries with the adoption of the ICI+ proposal. However, as it is due to expire by the end of 2013; a new financial instrument is needed for the period 2014-2020. Moreover, since the ICI Regulation entered into force, the EU has seen in particular the emergence of economies such as India, China and Brazil which are playing an increasingly prominent role in the international economy and trade, in multilateral fora (UN and G20) and in addressing challenges of global concern. While development and poverty alleviation remain a key concern, these countries are o developed broad based agreements with key partners and emerging economies to address bilateral issues and matters of global concern. Implementation of these instruments (i.e.: as agreements, declarations, action plans etc) requires a dedicated financing instrument so that the EU has the means to promote its interests effectively worldwide and to deal with global issues wherever the need arises. The EU does not currently possess a genuine instrument that would allow it to co-operate with new emerging economies on issues related to advancing core EU interests and on common challenges of global concern (such as climate change for instance or the need to promote sustainable development at all levels). The proposed Partnership Instrument is designed to overcome this limitation of the EU’s ability to engage internationally in the most effective way. It would fill the gap described above and, in particular, allow the EU to pursue agendas beyond development cooperation with global players, but also to defend core EU interests with any other partner country as the need arises. It could also underpin new relationships with countries graduating from bilateral development assistance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission examined 4 policy options: Option 0 : “Zero Option”: this implies that assistance under the current ICI instrument would be phased out as of 31 December 2013. Option 1 : “No change”: maintaining the status quo, the ICI Regulation would cover only traditional industrialised and high- income countries (.i.e. 17 countries) and the DCI Regulation would remain the only financial instrument, focused on development cooperation, to cover cooperation with some countries of great importance in terms of economics, demographics, and politics. Option 2 : “Maintain ICI as such and amend DCI”: this option would maintain the ICI in its current form and insert a window for economic, financial and technical cooperation of a non developmental nature with third countries within the DCI. Option 3 : “Table a new Instrument building on ICI/ICI+”: this option would build on the ICI and ICI+ proposal to provide a new Instrument with a global reach. After careful evaluation, neither discontinuing the ICI nor maintaining the status quo were deemed to be politically viable solutions. Limiting expenditure exclusively to action linked to poverty alleviation or maintaining this sole focus for cooperation with emerging economies would artificially limit the EU’s external action and neglect core EU interests. The option of amending the Development Cooperation Instrument to allow expenditure not related to official development assistance would have the advantage of geographical coherence (one instrument per country), but the difficulties of managing an instrument with two very different objectives were considered a serious handicap. By process of elimination, the preferred option is that of creating a new Instrument with a global reach (option 3) as this would allow for a clear distinction with Development Cooperation money and respect the Commission’s intention to increase coherence and consistency through a major simplification of the Instruments. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 207(2), 209(1) and 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed R egulation aims to establish a Partnership Instrument for cooperation with third countries to advance and promote EU and mutual interests. The Partnership Instrument shall support measures that respond in an effective and flexible manner to objectives arising from the Union's bilateral, regional or multilateral relationships with third countries and address challenges of global concern. Specific objectives : the measures to be financed under this Instrument shall reflect the following specific Union objectives: implementing the international dimension of the “Europe 2020” strategy by supporting Union’s bilateral, regional and inter-regional cooperation partnership strategies, by promoting policy dialogues and by developing collective approaches and responses to challenges of global concern such as energy security, climate change and environment. This objective shall be measured by the uptake of the “Europe 2020” policies and objectives by key partner countries; improving market access and developing trade, investment and business opportunities for European companies by means of economic partnerships and business and regulatory cooperation. This objective shall be measured by the Union’s share in foreign trade with key partner countries and by trade and investments flows to partner countries specifically targeted by actions, programmes and measures under this Regulation; enhancing widespread understanding and visibility of the Union and its role on the world scene by means of public diplomacy, education/academic cooperation and outreach activities to promote Union’s values and interests. General principles : to promote, develop and consolidate the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which it is founded by means of dialogue and cooperation with third countries; to enhance the impact of the Union’s assistance, a differentiated and flexible approach shall be pursued, where appropriate, in designing cooperation with partner countries to take account of their economic, social and political contexts as and also of the Union’s specific interests, policy priorities and strategies; to promote a multilateral approach to global challenges and shall foster cooperation with international or regional organisations and bodies, including international financial institutions, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, OECD, and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G20) and other bilateral donors; to ensure coherence and consistency with other areas of its external action, in particular the Development Cooperation Instrument for developing countries, and with other relevant Union’s policies when formulating policy, strategic planning and programming and implementing measures; to defend the Union’s specific interests, policy priorities and strategies. Third countries concerned : a ll third countries, regions and territories may be eligible for cooperation under this Regulation. However, this Regulation shall primarily support cooperation measures with developed and developing countries which play an increasingly prominent role in the international economy and trade, in multilateral fora, in global governance and in addressing challenges of global concern and where the Union has significant interests. Areas of cooperation : detailed areas of cooperation to be pursued by the Union’s assistance under this Regulation are listed in the Annex. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend or supplement the Annex. Programming and Indicative allocation of funds : the multi-annual indicative programmes shall set out the Union’s strategic and/or mutual interests and priorities, the specific objectives and expected results. For countries or regions for which a Joint Framework Document, laying down a comprehensive Union strategy has been established, the multi-annual indicative programmes shall be based on this document. The multiannual indicative programmes shall also set out the priority areas selected for financing by the Union and shall outline the indicative financial allocation of funds. Coherence and complementarity : coherence and complementarity with other external action geographical instruments, in particular the Development Cooperation Instrument, will be taken into account throughout the programming stage while integrating the principles of differentiation and concentration. Implementation : the implementation has been greatly simplified as an Article stipulates that the decision shall be implemented in accordance with the future Regulation establishing common implementation rules for external relations financing instruments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Commission in its Communication of 29 June 2011 entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” proposed allocating to the Partnership Instrument a total amount of EUR 1 131 million, at current prices, over the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to adapt the scope of this Regulation to the rapidly evolving reality in third countries, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the detailed areas of cooperation defined in the Annex. It is of particular importance that the Commission should carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council."

LEGAL BASIS: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Switzerland of the other, on the free movement of persons to take account of the accession of Croatia to the European Union. Principles: the Protocol seeks to revise the 2002 Agreement in order to take into account the accession of Croatia as regards the free movement of persons. It is provided that for a period of 7 years from the entry into force of the Protocol, Switzerland may limit the access of Croatian citizens into the labour market (quotas, priority to local workers, control of working conditions and wages). During the last two years of this transition period, the restrictions must be accepted by a mixed Switzerland-EU committee. Labour market restrictions: Switzerland may maintain quantitative limits in respect of access by workers employed in Switzerland and for self-employed persons who are nationals of Croatia for the following two categories of residence: N.B.: the draft Protocol does not provide any restrictions on residence of less than four months. The quantitative limits are set for each year of the Protocol’s seven year implementation. The quotas for each year are progressive so that Switzerland may open gradually, year by year, its labour market to Croatian workers. Regular labour market and controls: further provisions are laid down to enable Switzerland and Croatia to maintain the controls on the priority of workers integrated into the regular labour market and the wage and working conditions applicable to nationals of the other Contracting Party concerned. The same controls may be maintained for persons providing services in the following sectors: Review of the Protocol: before the end of the transitional period, the Joint Committee shall review the functioning of the transitional period applied to nationals of Croatia on the basis of a report from Switzerland. Upon completion of the review, Switzerland shall notify the Joint Committee whether it will continue applying quantitative limits to workers employed in Switzerland. Switzerland may continue to apply such measures for five years after the entry into force of the aforementioned Protocol. Croatia should be entitled to introduce the same quantitative limits for Swiss nationals for the same periods. Safeguard clause: at the end of the 7-year period of the Protocol, Switzerland shall have the opportunity for a further three years, to unilaterally activate the safeguard clause against Croatian citizens with a view to limiting the number of residence permits to allow them to work. Specific provisions are laid down to this effect. Duration of the transitional period: the total transition period with safeguard clause – if applicable – is 10 years from the date of entry into force of the Protocol. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the CLP Regulation entered into force in 2009 in order for the EU to implement the United Nations Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). The aim is to protect workers, consumers and the environment by means of labelling and indicating any potential hazardous effects of chemicals. The CLP Regulation is expected to facilitate global trade and harmonised communication of information on hazards posed by chemicals and to promote regulatory efficiency. It will complement the REACH Regulation. Directives 92/58/EEC, 92/85/EEC, 94/33/EC, 98/24/EC6 and 2004/37/EC contain references to EU chemical classification and labelling legislation. If these Directives are to remain effective, they need to be aligned to the CLP Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the proposed amendments to the five Directives maintain the current level of worker protection without additional requirements of significant impact, a formal impact assessment was not carried out. A full impact assessment for the CLP Regulation was presented during 2007. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the aim of the Directive is to update references and terminology of the five above-mentioned Directives in order to bring them into line with the applicable EU chemical classification and labelling legislation. In doing so, no changes to the scope or level of protection provided by these Directives are required. Regarding the non-exhaustive list of agents mentioned in the Annex, Part I, Section 3 of Directive 94/33/EC, an exact correlation between the pre-existing and new chemical classification systems cannot be achieved. The proposal therefore presents an alignment that may result in a limited number of additional substances coming within the scope of the Annex. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU-Moldova Association Agreement was signed on 24 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied from 1 September 2014. This Agreement includes: a bilateral safeguard clause which allows for the temporary suspension of preferences in case their application would result in an unexpected and significant increase of imports causing economic damage to the domestic industry of the importing party. In concrete terms, this instrument makes it possible to either suspend the further tariff liberalization or reintroduce the most favoured nation (MFN) customs duty rate; a so-called anti-circumvention mechanism, which provides for the possibility to reintroduce the MFN customs duty rate when imports of certain agricultural goods from Moldova exceed a given threshold without due justification of their exact origin. The Commission considered it necessary to lay down the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism. An implementing regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council is necessary to put in place in the EU’s internal legislation the necessary instrument to be able to apply the bilateral safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism of the Agreement already concluded with the Republic of Moldova. Safeguard measures : safeguard measures may be considered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products. The maximum duration of safeguard measures is determined and specific provisions regarding extension and review of such measures are laid down. Initiating an investigation : the tasks of following up and reviewing the Agreement, carrying out investigations and, if necessary, imposing safeguard measures should be carried out in the most transparent manner possible. The Commission should receive information including available evidence from the Member States of any trends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures. If there is sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of proceedings, the Commission should publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. Investigations : the proposal provides that there should be detailed provisions on the initiation of investigations, access to and inspections by interested parties of the information gathered, hearings for the interested parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views. It also sets time limits for the initiation of an investigation and for determinations as to whether or not safeguard measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. An investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure. Anti-circumvention mechanism : the proposed Regulation provides for the possibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of six months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed agricultural products reach the annual import volumes defined in the Association Agreement. Implementation : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the adoption of provisional and definitive safeguard measures, for the imposition of prior surveillance measures and for the termination of an investigation without measures provided for in the Agreement, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases a delay in the imposition of provisional safeguard measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair or in order to prevent a negative impact on the Union market as a result of an increase in imports."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to it. BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes and agencies to ENP partner countries is one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union’s neighbourhood. The Commission has expanded on this in its Communication “on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes”. The Council endorsed this approach in conclusions on 5 March 2007. The Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. To date, Protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. In December 2013, Lebanon expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the Protocol negotiated with Lebanon is attached and the subject of this proposal. It is now appropriate for the European Union to conclude the protocol. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and Article 218(7) thereof.

This Protocol contains a Framework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Lebanon in Union programmes. It contains standard conditions that should be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with whom such protocols are to be concluded. Objectives: the protocol seeks to define the financial and technical rules permitting Lebanon to participate in certain EU programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol sets out principles for economic, financial and technical cooperation measure and allows Lebanon to receive technical assistance, in particular financial assistance, from the European Union pursuant to the European Union programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 1990, programmes under the 'European territorial cooperation' objective, better known as 'Interreg', have supported cross-border cooperation programmes in EU border regions, including those with EFTA countries. Thousands of projects and initiatives that have helped to improve European integration have been funded. In recent decades, the European integration process has helped internal border regions to transform themselves from mainly peripheral areas into areas of growth and opportunities. However, the evidence gathered by the Commission shows that, in general, border regions generally perform less well economically than other regions within a Member State. Access to public services such as hospitals and universities is generally lower in border regions. Navigating between different administrative and legal systems is often still complex and costly. These programmes alone can hardly compensate for these differences. In its Communication of 20 September 2017 on EU border regions, the Commission highlighted ways in which the EU and its Member States can reduce the complexity, length and costs of cross-border interaction and promoted the pooling of services along internal borders. In 2015, the Luxembourg Presidency and several Member States studied the possibility of creating a new instrument to simplify cross-border projects by making it possible, on a voluntary basis and agreed by the competent authorities in charge, for the rules of one Member State to apply in the neighbouring Member State. This would apply to a specific project or action limited in time, located within a border region and initiated by local and/or regional public authorities. The Commission supports this idea and therefore proposes a voluntary mechanism to address legal obstacles in border regions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers that a voluntary mechanism to remove legal and administrative obstacles in all border regions would provide a cost-free legal framework in order to reduce the costs and time to complete certain cross-border projects. If 20% of existing legal and administrative obstacles found along internal borders were addressed, border regions would increase their GDP by 2%. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation sets up a mechanism to allow for the application in one Member State, with regard to a cross-border region, of the legal provisions from another Member State, where the application of the legal provisions of the former would constitute a legal obstacle hampering the implementation of a joint project. Characteristics of the mechanism : the mechanism shall consist of the conclusion of a European Cross-border Commitment, which is self-executing, or a European Cross-border Statement which requires a further legislative procedure in the Member State. The mechanism shall: remain voluntary : Member States may opt for the mechanism or use other effective mechanisms to resolve legal border barriers; focus on intra-EU land borders , while allowing Member States to also apply the mechanism to maritime and external borders; cover joint projects for any item of infrastructure with impact in a cross-border region or any service of general economic interest provided in a cross-border region. Member States opting for the Mechanism set up under the proposed Regulation are obliged to establish a national or, in the case of federal states, regional Cross-border Coordination Points. Procedure : the procedure for concluding a commitment or statement consists in: the preparation and submission of the initiative document, to be drafted by the ‘initiator’ (for example, the public or private body responsible for initiating or both initiating and implementing a joint project or one or more local or regional authority located in a given cross-border region or exercising public power in that cross-border region; a preliminary analysis by the Member State which is requested to ‘pull over the border’ the legal provisions of the neighbouring Member State; the drafting of the Commitment or Statement to be concluded; and finally the conclusion of the Commitment or Statement and its signing by the competent authorities of both Member States. Implementation : the Commitment is implemented by, where relevant, amending existing administrative acts based on the ‘normally’ applicable law or adopting new administrative acts based on the law ‘pulled over the border’. The Statement must be implemented by one or more submissions of proposals to the competent legislative body in order to amend the national law to cover the necessary derogations. In both cases, once all steps planned are implemented, the Cross-border Coordination Point must inform its counterpart in the other Member State and the EU coordination point."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Investment Fund (EIF) was founded in 1994 to stimulate sustained and balanced growth within the Community. Its statutory goal to support EU policies has been reflected in the exceptional growth of both equity investments and guarantees during the recent crisis. Following the capital increase of the EIF in 2007, the subscribed capital amounts to EUR 3 billion divided into 3 000 shares each with a nominal value of EUR 1 million. The paid-in capital of the EIF is currently EUR 600 million (i.e. 20 % of subscribed capital). Consequently, the Union, represented by the Commission, is currently subscribed to in total 900 shares of the Fund for a nominal value of EUR 900 million, of which EUR 180 million are paid-in. As of October 2013, the EIF is owned by the EIB (62.1 %), the European Union (30 %) and 24 public and private financial institutions (7.9 %). Recalling that restoring normal lending to the economy, in particular to SMEs, remains a priority, the European Council of December 2013 called on the Commission and the EIB to further enhance the capacity of the Fund through an increase in its capital with a view to reaching final agreement by May 2014. The current size of Fund's own funds does not allow for a substantial increase in the Fund's activity, as the guarantee and venture capital operations of the Fund may not exceed the ceilings set by the Statutes of the Fund or by the General Meeting of the Fund. Furthermore, the credit enhancement capacity of the Fund is limited by the size of its available own funds. Accordingly, on 26 November 2013, the EIF Board of Directors approved the increase in the EIF subscribed capital by up to EUR 1,500 million, of which 20 % will be paid-in. This would imply the subscription of 450 additional shares by the EU. CONTENT: the draft decision provides that in addition to its current shareholding in the EIF, the Union shall subscribe for up to 450 shares each of a nominal value of EUR 1 million in the Fund. The subscription of shares and the annual payments shall be carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions that shall be approved by the General Meeting of the Fund. In addition: · the Union shall purchase the new shares in the Fund over a four-year period starting in 2014; · during 2014 to 2017, the dividends received for the participation of the Union in the Fund shall be considered as external assigned revenue, in accordance with Regulation No 966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, to cover part of the cost of subscription; · a total amount of up to EUR 170 million for the whole period shall be available within the general budget of the European Union to cover the remaining cost, making use of appropriations already programmed within Heading 1a of the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020 in order to leave unchanged the total expenditure allocated. The budgetary commitment may be broken down into annual instalments over four years in accordance with Regulation No 966/2012. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the resources needed for the purchase of 450 shares are estimated at approximately EUR 175 million. The Commission proposes that the dividends which will be paid by the EIF during the years 2014-2017 will be used to cover part of the cost of the new shares. Assuming the 2013 level of the dividend pay-out ratio of 20 % to remain constant for the next four years, the dividends to be received during this period are estimated at around EUR 11.5 million. However, it needs to be stressed that the EIF uses a dividend pay-out ratio of 33% as a working assumption for their calculations in the document proposing EIF's capital increase to its Board of Directors. If this level of dividends was assumed, the purchase of 450 shares would require approx. EUR 172 million and the estimated dividends received during 2014-2017 would reach approx. EUR 19 million. The dividends are decided annually by the General Meeting of the EIF. Consequently, at this stage both the share issue price and the level of dividends cannot be calculated exactly for the whole period of subscription. In any case, the price to be paid by the EU for its part of the increase is not expected to exceed the sum of indicative budget appropriation for EUR 170 million plus the dividends received during 2014-2017. The Commission proposes to make use of appropriations already programmed for financial instruments under COSME and Horizon 2020 programmes to enhance access to financing for SMEs. Since both the COSME Regulation and the Horizon 2020 Regulation aim to assist SMEs, it is proposed to use part of the appropriations available for COSME and Horizon 2020 for the proposed EIF capital increase. The necessary adjustment to the 2014 budget will be proposed separately in a draft amending budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (at the request of the Court of Justice of the EU.) LEGAL BASIS : Article 257 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 106(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community; Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and in particular Article 62c thereof and Article 2(2) of Annex I thereto. BACKGROUND: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature a proposal for amendments to the Statute of the Court and Annex I thereto. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. The European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. In accordance with Article 62c of the Statute, as thus amended, the actual attachment of temporary Judges to the Civil Service Tribunal requires an amendment to Annex I [1] to the Statute. CONTENT: at the Court of Justice’s request, this proposal aims to lay down the rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges of the Tribunal, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties. This draft Regulation is linked to the draft amendments to the Statute of the Court and Annex I thereto. on a proposal from the President of the Court of Justice, the Council of the European Union shall draw up a list of three persons to be temporary Judges. Temporary Judges shall be chosen from among former Members of the Court of Justice of the European Union who are able to place themselves at the disposal of the Civil Service Tribunal. Temporary Judges shall be appointed for a period of four years and may be reappointed; the Civil Service Tribunal may decide to avail itself of the assistance of a temporary Judge if it determines that a Judge is or will be prevented, on medical grounds, from participating in judicial business and that the situation will be or is likely to be of at least three months’ duration, and if it takes the view that that Judge is nevertheless not suffering from disablement deemed to be total. In this case, the President of the Tribunal shall call upon a temporary Judge to undertake judicial duties; temporary Judges who are called upon to take up their duties shall exercise the prerogatives of a Judge solely in the context of dealing with cases to which they are assigned. This implies that temporary Judges would be able to perform only strictly judicial duties and would not be entitled to participate in the administration of the Civil Service Tribunal or in the election of the President of the Tribunal or Presidents of Chambers; with regard to emoluments, the proposal provides that temporary Judges shall receive remuneration of an amount equal to 1/30th of the basic monthly salary allocated to Judges under Article 21c(2) of Regulation No 422/67/EEC and No 5/67/Euratom for each day. Temporary Judges would also be entitled to reimbursement of their travel and hotel expenses, as well as to payment of a daily subsistence allowance, in respect of journeys to Luxembourg in the course of their duties. The amount by which the remuneration together with the pension provided for in Article 8 of Regulation No 422/67/EEC and No 5/67/Euratom exceeds the remuneration, before deduction of taxes, which the temporary Judge was receiving as a member of the Court of Justice of the European Union shall be deducted from that pension; lastly, the draft regulation sets out the circumstances under which the duties of temporary judges will cease. This will take place on his death or resignation, or by decision to deprive him of his office as provided by the Statute. The duties of a temporary Judge shall also end when the Judge whom he has replaced is no longer prevented from acting."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings. In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. This draft Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should also be noted that in order to provide urgent financing, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. This period refers to elapse of time between a draft legislative act being made available to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a provisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a position under a legislative procedure. CONTENT: the Council proposes that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (MFF Regulation) should therefore be amended to stipulate that the commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the Global Margin for Commitments. Margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global Margin for Commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 established a European framework for cross-border insolvency proceedings. It determines which Member State has jurisdiction for opening insolvency proceedings, establishes uniform rules on applicable law and provides for the recognition and enforcement of insolvency-related decisions as well as for the coordination of main and secondary insolvency proceedings. Adopted in May 2000, the Insolvency Regulation has applied since 31 May 2002. Ten years after its entry into force, the Commission's December 2012 report on the application of the Regulation concludes that the Regulation is functioning well in general but that it is desirable to improve the application of certain of its provisions. The evaluation of the Insolvency Regulation identified five main shortcomings: the Regulation's scope does not cover national procedures which provide for the restructuring of a company at a pre-insolvency stage (“pre-insolvency proceedings”) or proceedings which leave the existing management in place (“hybrid proceedings”); there are difficulties in determining which Member State is competent to open insolvency proceedings; problems have also been identified with respect to secondary proceedings; there are problems relating to the rules on publicity of insolvency proceedings and the lodging of claims; the Regulation does not contain specific rules dealing with the insolvency of a multi-national enterprise group although a large number of cross-border insolvencies involve groups of companies. According to the Commission, the revision of the Regulation will contribute to ensuring a smooth development and the survival of businesses, as stated in the Small Business Act . The revision is also one of the key actions listed in the Single Market Act II . IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed the costs and benefits of the main aspects of the proposed reform in its Impact Assessment which accompanies this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main elements of the proposed reform of the Insolvency Regulation may be summarised as follows: Scope : the proposal extends the scope of the Regulation by revising the definition of insolvency proceedings to include hybrid and pre-insolvency proceedings, as well as debt discharge proceedings and other insolvency proceedings for natural persons which currently do not fit the definition. It is proposed to: amend the current definition of ""insolvency proceedings"" to open the scope to proceedings which do not involve a liquidator but in which the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a court; make an express reference to proceedings for the adjustment of debts and to the purpose of rescue in order to include also those proceedings which enable the debtor to find an arrangement with his creditors at a preinsolvency stage. Jurisdiction : the proposal clarifies the jurisdiction rules and improves the procedural framework for determining jurisdiction. The proposal retains the concept of the centre of main interest (COMI) but complements the definition of it. It also introduces a provision determining the COMI of natural persons. In addition, a new recital clarifies the circumstances in which the presumption that the COMI of a legal person is located at the place of its registered office can be rebutted. Furthermore, the proposal grants all foreign creditors a right to challenge the opening decision and ensures that these creditors are informed of the opening decision in order to be able to effectively exercise their rights. Secondary proceedings : several modifications are proposed with the aim of improving the efficient administration of the debtor's estate in situations where the debtor has an establishment in another Member State . The proposal provides for a more efficient administration of insolvency proceedings by: enabling the court to refuse the opening of secondary proceedings if this is not necessary to protect the interests of local creditors, abolishing the requirement that secondary proceedings must be winding-up proceedings and improving the cooperation between main and secondary proceedings, in particular by extending the cooperation requirements to the courts involved. Publicity of insolvency proceedings and lodging of claims : the proposal requires Member States to publish the relevant court decisions in cross-border insolvency cases in a publicly accessible electronic register and provides for the interconnection of national insolvency registers. The proposal facilitates the lodging of claims for foreign creditors, particularly small creditors and SMEs, in three ways: (i) it introduces standard forms for the lodging of claims which will be available in all official languages of the European Union; (ii) it gives foreign creditors at least 45 days following publication of the notice of opening of proceedings in the insolvency register to lodge their claims; (iii) legal representation will not be mandatory for lodging a claim in a foreign jurisdiction, thereby reducing costs for creditors. Groups of companies : the proposal creates a specific legal framework to deal with the insolvency of members of a group of companies while maintaining the entity-by-entity approach which underlies the current Insolvency Regulation. introduces an obligation to coordinate insolvency proceedings relating to different members of the same group of companies by obliging the liquidators and the courts involved to cooperate with each other in a similar way as this is proposed in the context of main and secondary proceedings; gives each liquidator standing in the proceedings concerning another member of the same group. In particular, the liquidator has a right to be heard in these other proceedings, to request a stay of the other proceedings and to propose a reorganisation plan in a way which would enable the respective creditors' committee or court to take a decision on it. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal would have limited impact on the EU budget. The IT application for the interconnection of the insolvency registers has already been developed and will be hosted on the e-Justice Portal. The implication for the EU budget over 2014-2020 will comprise only of hosting and maintenance costs of the IT application. In total, these costs would amount to EUR 1 500 000 for the period 2014-2020 and would be covered by the financial envelope of the future Justice programme . DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: information society services and especially intermediary services have become an important part of the EU’s economy and daily life of Union citizens. Twenty years after the adoption of the existing legal framework applicable to such services laid down in e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, new and innovative business models and services, such as online social networks and marketplaces, have allowed business users and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. A majority of EU citizens now use those services on a daily basis. However, the digital transformation and increased use of those services has also resulted in new risks and challenges, both for individual users and for society as a whole. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more specifically, intermediary services). It aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the EU, by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member States have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. The proposed regulation lays down harmonised rules on the provision of intermediary services in the internal market. In particular, it establishes: - a framework for the conditional exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services; - rules on specific due diligence obligations tailored to certain specific categories of providers of intermediary services; - rules on the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, including as regards the cooperation of and coordination between the competent authorities. This proposal should apply to intermediary services provided to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or residence in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment of the providers of those services. Specific provisions The proposal lays down: - measures to counter illegal goods, services or content online, such as a mechanism for users to flag such content and for platforms to cooperate with ‘trusted flaggers’; - new obligations on traceability of business users in online marketplaces, to help identify sellers of illegal goods; - effective safeguards for users, including the possibility to challenge platforms’ content moderation decisions; - transparency measures for online platforms on a variety of issues, including on the algorithms used for recommendations; - obligations for very large platforms to prevent the misuse of their systems by taking risk-based action and by independent audits of their risk management systems; - access for researchers to key data of the largest platforms, in order to understand how online risks evolve; - oversight structures to address the complexity of the online space: EU countries will have the primary role, supported by a new European Board for Digital Services; for very large platforms, enhanced supervision and enforcement by the Commission. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact of the proposal should be covered by the allocations foreseen in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 under the financial envelopes of the Single Market Programme and the Digital Europe Programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in June 2008, the Commission made a proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures. The proposal was intended to replace Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms and certain transitional technical measures as laid down in Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 establishing for 2009 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks. The proposed Council Regulation was not adopted before the date on which the measures provided for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 ceased to apply. For reasons of legal certainty and in order to maintain the proper conservation and management of marine resources, Council Regulation (EC) No 1288/2009 establishing transitional technical measures from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011 was adopted, providing for the continuation of temporary technical measures catered for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 for a transitional period of 18 months. In view of the new requirements of the Lisbon Treaty, the Commission withdrew in 2010 the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures. Basic principles on technical measures will be considered by the new basic regulation for the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy, for which a proposal is envisaged during the third quarter of 2011. Regulation (EC) No 1288/2009 will expire on 30 June 2011 . Given the fact that there is no current legal act that could provide for permanent technical measures, and in order to ensure legal certainty and the conservation of marine resources, it is appropriate to extend the validity of the regulation for another 18 months, until 1 January 2013. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no financial implications for the budget of the European Union."
343EP8,"""""Cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences""""",0.871,0.946,0.98,0.562,0.192,0.925,0.916,0.904,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to facilitate the cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: improving road safety is a prime objective of the Union's transport policy. An important element of that policy is the consistent enforcement of sanctions for road traffic offences committed in the Union which considerably jeopardise road safety. However, due to a lack of appropriate procedures and notwithstanding existing possibilities under Council Decision 2008/615/JHA and Council Decision 2008/616/JHA (the 'Prüm Decisions'), sanctions in the form of financial penalties for certain road traffic offences are often not enforced if those offences are committed with a vehicle, which is registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place. On 19 March 2008, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety on the basis of Article 71(1)(c) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Article 91 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFUE')). Directive 2011/82/EU was adopted on 25 October 2011. The European Parliament and the Council chose Article 87(2) TFEU on police cooperation as its legal basis. The Commission fully supported the contents of the adopted Directive but decided to challenge its legal basis before the Court of Justice of the European Union. In its judgement of 6 May 2014, case C-43/12, the Court annulled Directive 2011/82/EU, but maintained its effects until the entry into force of a new Directive on the basis of the transport article of the Treaty within a reasonable period of time. Following the Commission Communication of 20 July 2010 entitled 'Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020', the Council invited the Commission to examine the possibilities of harmonising traffic rules at Union level where appropriate and adopting further measures on facilitating cross-border enforcement with regard to road traffic offences, in particular those related to serious traffic accidents. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given that the proposal does not contain any new elements as compared to the annulled Directive, the impact assessment of the initial Commission proposal remains valid. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to ensure a high level of protection for all road users in the Union by facilitating the cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences and thereby the enforcement of sanctions, where those offences are committed with a vehicle registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place. Road safety related traffic offences comprise: speeding; failing to stop at a red traffic light; driving under the influence of drink, drugs; failing to wear a safety helmet; illegally using a mobile telephone or any other communication devices while driving. The proposal is almost identical to the text of the annulled Directive. The main objective of that Directive was to put an end to the anonymity of non-resident drivers and to make sure that their road traffic offences would not go unpunished. For this reason the Directive provided the Member States with the mutual access to each other's vehicle registration data via an electronic data exchange network. This would allow them to identify drivers when they commit traffic offences abroad, thus ensuring equal treatment of non-resident and resident drivers. Once the vehicle owner's name and address are known, a letter to the presumed offender may be sent, on the basis of a model established by the Directive. The Member State of offence will have kept their right to decide on the follow up of the traffic offence. The Commission proposes to introduce minor amendments in order to comply with the Court of Justice case: Legal basis : the legal basis for the adoption of measures at EU level in the field of road safety is Article 91(1)(c) TFEU. UK, Ireland and Denmark : in recitals 22 and 23 of the annulled Directive, UK, Ireland and Denmark had, in accordance with Protocols no 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaties, the possibility not to take part in adoption of, be bound by or subject to the application of that Directive. However, where those Protocols do not apply since they only apply to Title V of the TFEU, those recitals should be deleted. Data protection : taking account of the new legal basis, the general rules on data protection provided for in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data should therefore apply. Consequently, the proposal should refer to Directive 95/46/EC, both in general and for the provisions on rectification, erasure, blocking and maximum storage time. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no other budgetary implications than those already mentioned in the annulled Directive. DELEAGTED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
2595EP8,"""""Establishment of a European Platform to enhance cooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work""""",0.914,0.923,0.96,0.438,0.154,0.91,0.911,0.75,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a Platform to enhance EU cooperation in the prevention of undeclared work. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the draft decision notes that undeclared work has serious budgetary implications through decreased tax and social security revenues. It has negative impacts on employment, productivity and working conditions, skills development and life-long learning. It results in lower pension rights and less access to health care and causes unfair competition between undertakings. A closely related phenomenon is falsely declared work, or bogus self-employment, which also has negative consequences in terms of health and safety and social security coverage of the workers concerned. The European Parliament in its resolution of 14 January 2014 called for stronger cooperation and reinforcement of labour inspectorates to fight undeclared work. The main responsibility for tackling undeclared work lies with Member States and relies mostly on three types of enforcement bodies: labour inspectorates, social security inspectorates fighting fraud on social insurance contributions, and tax authorities. In some Member States, social partners, customs authorities, migration bodies, the police and the public prosecutor's office are involved. It has, however, been noticed that, in some cases, cooperation between these different bodies at national level is not as structured or effective as necessary. As the challenges are common to Member States, and as undeclared work often has a cross-border dimension, EU level action can play an important role by reinforcing cooperation between enforcement authorities within and between different Member States in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work. At the moment, there is no formal mechanism in place for all relevant authorities from Member States to address issues related to cross-border aspects of undeclared work. The Communication of 2012 ""Towards a job-rich recovery"" highlighted the need for improved cooperation among Member States and announced the launch of consultations on setting up an EU-level platform between labour inspectorates and other enforcement bodies to combat undeclared work, aimed at improving cooperation, sharing best practices and identifying common principles for inspections. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this included several options for enhancing EU cooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work, and concluded that the preferred option would be the establishment of a European Platform with mandatory membership. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft decision establishes a Platform to enhance EU cooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work, composed of national enforcement authorities as nominated by all the Member States and the Commission. Observers: representatives of the social partners at cross-industry level, as well as from sectors with high incidence of undeclared work may attend meetings of the Platform as observers. Other observers include Eurofound, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the ILO. Objectives : the Platform will contribute to better enforcement of EU and national law, to the reduction of undeclared work and the emergence of formal jobs, by: improving cooperation between Member States' different enforcement authorities at EU level to prevent and deter undeclared work, including bogus self-employment, more efficiently and effectively ; improving Member States' different enforcement authorities' technical capacity to tackle cross-border aspects of undeclared work, increasing public awareness on the urgency of action and encouraging Member States to step up their efforts in dealing with undeclared work. To achieve these objectives, the Platform will: (i) exchange best practices and information, (ii) develop expertise and analysis, (iii) coordinate cross-border operational actions. Tasks: the draft decision sets out a list of tasks that the Platform should carry out for the execution of its mission. These include : establishing a knowledge bank of different practices/measures, including bilateral agreements used in Member States to deter undeclared work ; adopting non-binding guidelines for inspectors, handbooks of good practice and common principles of inspections ; developing permanent training capacity for enforcement authorities and adopting a common framework for carrying out joint trainings ; and organising peer reviews to follow Member States progress, including support for the implementation of country-specific recommendations. Single Pint of Contact : to achieve its objectives, the Platform will be supported by a 'Single point of contact' in each Member State who should have the necessary authority to liaise with national authorities dealing with the multifaceted aspects of undeclared work. Operation : the Commission will coordinate the work of the Platform and chair its meetings. The Platform shall adopt by majority decision, the rules of procedure, a two-year work programme, and the establishment of working groups to examine issues specified in work Programmes. Review: four years after its entry into force, the Commission must submit a report on the application of the decision and assess to what extent the Platform has contributed to the achievement of its objectives. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: Regulation (EU) No 1296/2013 establishes an EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (""EaSI"") for the period 2014-2020. Funding for the Platform will come from the PROGRESS axis. An indicative amount of 2.1 million EUR per year is provided for carrying out the tasks, such as the establishment of practical tools, support by service providers, publishing of common guidelines and principles, and handbooks, developing a permanent training capacity and a common framework for carrying out joint trainings, organising peer reviews and European Campaigns. In addition, grants to finance projects supporting the achievement of the objectives of the Platform will be covered. Up to 224 000 EUR per year will be used to reimburse the costs related to participation in the Platform meetings. It is also recalled that the European Social Fund (ESF) supports Member States' efforts to improve the quality of public administration. Financing is envisaged within the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. The legislative proposal is budget-neutral and does not require additional staff resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: BACKGROUND : Directive 2009/142/EC setting out the conditions for the placing on the market and putting into service of appliance burning gaseous fuels is based on the “New Approach” principles regarding technical harmonisation and standards. It sets out only the essential requirements applying to appliances burning gaseous fuels, whereas technical details are adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 on European Standardisation. Experience from the implementation of Directive 2009/142/EC has shown the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty as regards the definitions relating to its scope, the content of the Member States' communications of their gas types and supply pressures and certain essential requirements. The Commission proposes to replace Directive 2009/142/EC with a Regulation, so as to impose clear and detailed rules which do not give room for divergent transposition by Member States and ensure a uniform implementation throughout the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option of modifying Directive 2009/142/EC was found to be the preferred option because: (i) it is considered more effective since it will be enforceable in law ; (ii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iii) no significant economic or social impacts could be identified. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation does not change the current scope of Directive 2009/142/EC. However, it modifies some of its provisions in order to clarify and update their content. The proposed Regulation is also aligned to the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). · the removal of the outdated temperature limit of 105°C from the definition of the scope; · the introduction of currently missing definitions for the sector specific terminology under Directive 2009/142/EC; · the introduction of a harmonised content and form of the communications of Member States on the types of gas and corresponding supply pressures used on their territory; · the clarification of the relationship between Directive 2009/142/EC and other EU harmonisation legislation, including Ecodesign implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC and other Union energy policy instruments; · the improvement of the readability of some of the provisions of Directive 2009/142/EC. The modification also includes the following points: Making available on the market of gas appliances and fittings, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement : the proposal contains the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision. The proposed Regulation keeps the existing provision according to which fittings do not bear the CE marking. However, in order to improve clarity, the certificate accompanying fittings under Directive 2009/142/EC has been qualified as “Fitting conformity certificate”, in order to better define its content and clarify its relationship with the EU declaration of conformity requirement under other possibly applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Notified bodies: in line with the NLF Decision, the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and introduces specific requirements for notifying authorities. Conformity assessment: the proposal keeps the conformity assessment procedures provided for under Directive 2009/142/EC. However, it updates the corresponding modules in line with the NLF Decision. In particular, it keeps the requirement for a notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all appliances and fittings. Furthermore, it keeps the current approach for the design phase, according to which the type examination of the product by the notified body takes the form of examination of the complete appliance or fitting. Therefore, in accordance with the NLF Decision, it provides only for the EU-type examination – production type. ENTRY INRO FORCE: the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies, Member States and European Standardisation Bodies, time to adapt to the new requirements. A transitional provision is envisaged for the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2009/142/EC so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called “Open Skies” cases, on 5 June 2003 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral air services agreements with an agreement at Union level (the “horizontal authorisation”). The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. CONTENT: in accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the ”horizontal authorisation”, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the Republic of Korea that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of Korea. The objective of the Agreement is to bring bilateral air services agreements between 22 Member States and the Republic of Korea in line with Union law: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. - Article 4 safeguards the right of Member States under EU law to impose, on a non-discriminatory basis, taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on fuel supplied in its territory for use in an aircraft of a designated air carrier of the Republic of Korea that operates between a point in the territory of that Member State and another point in the territory of that Member State or in the territory of another Member State. - Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union.

5897EP7,"""""European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps""""",0.351,0.894,0.947,0.484,0.424,0.904,0.903,0.057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: the establishment of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the face of the increasing number and magnitude of humanitarian crises (natural catastrophes and man-made crises), the Union has to ensure adequate humanitarian aid. As envisaged in Article 214(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this proposal establishes the framework for the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, which should enable joint contributions from European volunteers in humanitarian aid operations. Its objective is to express the Union's humanitarian values and solidarity with people in need whether within or beyond the Union’s borders. Improving the mobilisation of the volunteering capacity of European citizens can also project a positive image of the Union in the world and foster interest for pan-European projects in support of humanitarian aid activities. The proposal builds on the 2010 Communication ""How to express EU citizens’ solidarity through volunteering: First reflections on a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps"". The Communication presents the guiding principles, gaps and necessary conditions to make a positive contribution to Union humanitarian aid. The Council and the European Parliament have expressed strong support for the initiative, reaffirming the key role of the Union in promoting volunteering and identifying some of the key components of the Corps. This proposal will, moreover, contribute to: the objectives of the Union's external policy and, in particular, the Union's humanitarian aid objectives; and reinforcing the benefits delivered to the hosting communities in third countries and the impact that the volunteer activities have on the volunteers themselves. Furthermore, the training and informal learning experience volunteers will acquire is a strong investment in human capital which would improve their employability in global economy and thus contribute to the Europe's 2020 objectives for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: interested stakeholders, including the main humanitarian aid organisations (NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Family, UN agencies), mainstream volunteer organisations, individual volunteers, Member States' representatives and other relevant actors were specifically consulted at two dedicated conferences 5 and through a public on-line consultation. An impact assessment report was prepared to examine policy options and their potential impacts. The main problems identified are: (1) lack of a structured EU approach towards volunteering; (2) poor visibility of EU humanitarian action and solidarity with people in need; (3) lack of consistent identification and selection mechanisms across Member States; (4) insufficient availability of qualified volunteers for humanitarian aid; (5) shortcomings in the surge capacity of humanitarian aid; and vi) weak capacity of hosting organisations. The impact assessment examined a number of policy options resulting from the combination of different modules and mode of management: Policy Option 1 , including: (1) Development of standards for identification, selection and training of volunteers and (2) Development of certification mechanism for sending organisations; Policy Option 2 , including the modules under Option 1 plus (3) Support to training for EU volunteers in humanitarian aid, (4) Creation of an EU Register of trained volunteers, (5) Development of standards and a certification mechanism for volunteer management in hosting organisations; Policy Option 3 , including all modules under Option 2 plus (6) Support to deployment of EU volunteers, (7) Building capacity in third country hosting organisations, (8) Establishment of an EU Network of humanitarian volunteers. This Option would be implemented in partnership with humanitarian aid organisations which should identify, select and deploy the volunteers. Policy Option 4 , including all modules under Option 3 implemented in a direct management mode by the European Commission. Based on this assessment of the potential economic, social and environmental impacts, Policy Option 3 was recommended as the most efficient and effective option for addressing the problems identified. LEGAL BASIS: Article 214(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal lays down the procedures and the rules for the operation of the EU Aid Volunteers. It follows an enabling approach and is limited to the essential elements necessary for the implementation of the Regulation, including specifying its general and operational objectives, the principles and the actions of which it consists, the provisions for financial assistance and the general provisions for its implementation. General objective and operational objectives: the objective of the EU Aid Volunteers shall be to express the Union's humanitarian values and solidarity with people in need, through the promotion of an effective and visible EU Aid Volunteers' initiative, which contributes to strengthening the Union's capacity to respond to humanitarian crises and to building the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster affected communities in third countries. The EU Aid Volunteers shall pursue the following operational objectives: Increase in and improvement of the capacity of the Union to provide humanitarian aid; Improvement of the skills and competences of volunteers in the field of humanitarian aid and the conditions under which they are working; Building the capacity of hosting organisations and foster volunteering in third countries; Promotion of the visibility of the Union's humanitarian aid values; Enhancement of coherence and consistency of volunteering across Member States in order to improve opportunities for Union citizens to participate in humanitarian aid activities and operations. Progress towards the achievement of this operational objective shall be assessed on the basis of key indicators, which shall be used for monitoring, evaluation and review of performance as appropriate. They are indicative and may be amended in order to take into account experience from the progress measurement. General principles: EU Aid Volunteers’ actions: shall be conducted in compliance with the humanitarian aid principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence; shall respond to the need of local communities and hosting organisations and should contribute to the professionalization of the provision of humanitarian aid. In this context, the safety and security of volunteers shall be a priority. The EU Aid Volunteers shall promote common activities and participation of volunteers from different countries and foster joint projects and transnational partnerships between implementing organisations. Types of actions undertaken by the volunteers: the EU Aid Volunteers shall pursue the above-mentioned objectives through the following types of actions: development and maintenance of standards regarding candidate and EU Aid Volunteers; development and maintenance of a certification mechanism for sending and hosting organisations; identification and selection of candidate volunteers; establishment of a training programme and support for training and apprenticeship placements; establishment, maintenance and updating of a Register of EU Aid Volunteers; deployment of EU Aid Volunteers in third countries for humanitarian aid activities and operations; capacity building of hosting organisations; establishment and management of an EU Aid Volunteers' Network; communication, awareness raising and visibility; ancillary activity that furthers the accountability, transparency and effectiveness of the EU Aid Volunteers. These different actions can be supported with financial assistance and implemented by different beneficiaries based on a Commission annual work programme. As regards certain specific actions, the proposal specifies the following types of actions: Standards regarding candidate and EU Aid Volunteers: the Commission will develop standards which will set the policy framework and minimum requirements to ensure effective, efficient and coherent recruitment and preparation of candidate volunteers and deployment and management of EU Aid Volunteers which are the main actions of this initiative. The standards will ensure duty of care and cover notably responsibilities of the sending and hosting organisations, minimum requirements on the coverage of subsistence, accommodation and other relevant expenses, insurance coverage and other relevant elements. Certification: sending organisations that would like to select, prepare and deploy EU Aid Volunteers will have to be certified for compliance with these standards. They should meet different eligibility requirements and follow a differentiated certification procedure (to be defined in implementing acts), taking into account their nature and capacity (e.g. Member States' public bodies, NGOs). Civil protection and development cooperation actors acting in the field of humanitarian aid shall also be considered eligible. A differentiated certification mechanism will be established for eligible hosting organisations. Although private companies are not eligible as sending or hosting organisations, they can be associated with projects and co-finance part of the costs of the volunteer to encourage corporate volunteering. Identification and selection of candidate volunteers: the EU Aid Volunteers are open for participation to Union citizens as well as nationals legally residing in the EU on a long term basis. Subject to agreements as referred to in the proposal, citizens from candidate and potential candidate countries and from partner countries from the European Neighbourhood Policy may apply to become EU Aid Volunteers. On the basis of an annual work programme, the Commission will publish calls for proposals for the identification and selection of candidate volunteers by certified sending organisations. Sending organisations that have been awarded the contracts in response to these calls will identify and select candidate volunteers for training after prior assessment of the needs in third countries by sending or hosting organisations or other relevant actors. Training and pre-deployment preparation: the selected candidate volunteers will undergo tailor-made training, taking into account their prior experience. The training programme will be organised by the Commission and will be implemented by organisations with specific training expertise. In addition, as part of their training and depending on their training needs, candidate volunteers will be able to gain practical experience through apprenticeship placements or other forms of short term predeployment preparation given by certified sending organisations. Register of EU Aid Volunteers: candidate volunteers should be assessed for their preparedness to be deployed in third countries. If successful, they should be included in a Register of EU Aid Volunteers eligible for deployment which will be managed by the Commission. The Register will also include volunteers who have already been deployed, if they are willing to be considered for future deployment. Deployment of EU Aid Volunteers in third countries: on the basis of its annual work programme, the Commission will publish calls for proposals for the deployment of EU Aid Volunteers by certified sending organisations. Sending organisations that have been awarded the contracts in response to these calls can select volunteers from the Register and deploy them to hosting organisations. The Commission may also deploy volunteers from the Register to the Commission’s humanitarian aid field offices or in response operations in third countries through the Emergency Response Centre that facilitates the Union response to disasters. The specific terms of deployment will be set-out in a contract between the sending organisation and the volunteer. Capacity building of hosting organisations: through this action, the Commission can support capacity building actions of the hosting organisations so as to ensure effective management of the EU Aid Volunteers and sustainable impact of their work, including the promotion of local volunteering. EU Aid Volunteers' Network: this action envisages the establishment of an EU Aid Volunteers' Network which will be managed by the Commission. It will consist of and facilitate interaction between the EU Aid Volunteers and will also carry out specific activities, notably through knowledge sharing and dissemination of information. It shall also support activities such as seminars, workshops and alumni activities. Communication, awareness raising and visibility: this action will support public information, communication and awareness raising actions to promote the EU Aid Volunteers and to encourage volunteering in humanitarian aid. The Commission will develop an information and communication action plan, which will be implemented by all beneficiaries, in particular sending and hosting organisations. Financial provisions: provisions are envisaged for laying down the framework for actions that are eligible for financial assistance and the potential beneficiaries of financial assistance. In this context, the Commission may consider the added-value and management advantages of creating an EU Trust Fund. Work programme: in order to implement this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt an annual work programme which will set out the objectives pursued, the expected results, the method of implementation and their total amount. It shall also contain the description of actions to be financed, an indication of the amount allocated to each action and an indicative implementation timetable. For grants, they shall include the priorities, the essential evaluation criteria and the maximum rate of co-financing. Coherence and complementarity: in implementing the Regulation, coherence shall be ensured with other areas of Union's external action and with other relevant Union policies (in particular, development policy) and with the actions undertaken in the Member States and/or with relevant international organisations. Report and evaluation: the Regulation shall be regularly evaluated, in particular in an interim report in 2017 and in the context of a final report preparing the ground for a communication on the continued of the implementation of the Regulation (by no later than 31 December 2018).. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Commission communication entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” provides, for the creation of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, with budgetary commitments amounting to EUR 239.1 million (current prices). DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission is empowered to adopt modalities of some of the actions through delegated acts on standards and amending indicators for operational objectives, or through implementing acts regarding the certification mechanism and modalities of the training programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that affect normal activity of the competent authorities in the Member States and the work of transport undertakings as regards the administrative formalities to be completed in different transport sectors that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of the relevant measures. Those extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on various areas covered by Union transport law. In particular, transport operators and other persons concerned may not be able to complete the necessary formalities or procedures to comply with certain provisions of Union law related to the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations or to complete other steps necessary to maintain their validity. This is the case, for instance, with driving licences, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers, Community licences and driver attestations for the provisions of road haulage services, rail single safety certificates or authorisations, boatmasters’ certificates or port security assessments etc. It is most likely that those certificates, licences, authorisations which, in accordance with Union law, would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 could not be renewed in due time. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt temporary provisions extending the validity of those certificates, licences or authorisations that would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and ensure that they remain valid during a reasonable period of time during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down specific and temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in response to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the area of road, rail and inland waterways transport and maritime security. This proposal concerns specific provisions that affect the application of several Directives and Regulations:  Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which (lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses with the objective to ensure safety on European roads). Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (provides for the mutual recognition of the driving licences issued by Member States based on a Union model driving licence). Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (defines the harmonised minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness testing). Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator). Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lay down common rules for access to the international road haulage market and the international market for coach and bus services, respectively). Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/798 (regulate safety certification and authorisation in the Union). Directive 2007/59/EC of the European Parliament (lays down rules on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union). Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (establishes a single European railway area). Directive 96/50/EC (lays down conditions for obtaining boatmasters’ certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union).

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council is an element to progress towards the Energy Union, under which energy efficiency should be treated as an energy source in its own right. The 'energy efficiency first' principle should be taken into account when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. The European Council of October 2014 set a 27 % energy efficiency target for 2030, to be reviewed by 2020 'having in mind a Union level of 30%. In December 2015, the European Parliament called upon the Commission to also assess the viability of a 40 % energy efficiency target for the same timeframe. The Commission proposed to review and consequently amend the Directive to adapt it to the 2030 perspective. Energy efficiency is one of the most cost effective ways to support the transition to a low carbon economy and to create growth, employment and investment opportunities. Moderation of energy demand is one of the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy adopted on 25 February 2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment showed that a level higher than 27 % energy efficiency in 2030 would bring higher benefits with regard to jobs and economic growth, security of supply, greenhouse gas emission reductions, health and environment. Based on this multidimensional analysis a political decision of a binding 30 % energy efficiency target was taken. Underpinned by dedicated policies at the EU, national and regional level, this target will bring substantial multiple benefits for Europe. Such a target represents a drop in final energy consumption of 17% compared to 2005. It will increase economic growth, leading to an increase in GDP of around 0.4% (EUR 70 billion). In terms of social impacts, the preferred option would have a positive effect on employment: a review of more than 20 studies concluded that for every EUR 1.2 million spent on energy efficiency approximately 23 jobs are directly supported in the energy efficiency industry. CONTENT: the proposal for an amending Directive presented by the Commission aims to improve the current Directive (Directive 2012/27/EU) on energy efficiency. set a 30% binding energy efficiency target for 2030 at EU level which will give Member States and investors a long term perspective to plan their policies and investments and to adapt their strategies towards energy efficiency; extend beyond 2020 the energy saving obligation while retaining the rate of 1.5% of annual energy sales and the possibility to use both energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative measures while making it clear that Member States can achieve the required energy savings through an energy efficiency obligation scheme, alternative measures, or a combination of both approaches; improve the provision of consumer information on their heating and cooling consumption and their rights in metering and billing of thermal energy strengthened, in particular for people living in multi-apartment buildings. In order to improve frequency of information, an obligation for heat meters to be remotely readable is introduced; strengthen social aspects of energy efficiency by requiring that energy poverty must be taken into account in designing energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative measures; amending the article on delegated powers in order to delete the current time limit on the delegation, replacing it with the standard five year period; add a general review clause to the Directive, under which the Commission must evaluate the Directive and submit a report to the European Parliament and Council by 28 February 2024, and then every five years. amend the default primary energy factor (PEF) in Annex IV to take into account technological advances."

This Fund will take over from the External Borders Fund 2007-2013 which shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the policies related to the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. These policies are at the heart of the European project to create an area without internal borders where Union citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. In the field of Internal Security, key documents such as the Commission's Communication on the Internal Security Strategy have provided clear guidance on the direction of activities in the years to come. For border management and visa policy, the Communication on Migration outlined in more detail the challenges ahead in relation to border security and the development of an area without internal borders. The Communication on the Schengen governance presented proposals to strengthen the Schengen acquis by means of a governance system capable of responding effectively, and in a timely and coordinated Union-wide way, to exceptional circumstances and challenges which might put the overall functioning of Schengen at stake. The Communication on smart borders – options and the way ahead outlines how new IT systems such as an Entry/exit system and a Registered Traveller Programme can contribute to a better management of migration flows in the Union. A key component in the common integrated border management system has been the development of Union solidarity mechanisms, supporting a uniform and high-quality application of the Union standards on border management and the common visa policy. Enhancing the coordination of operational co-operation by the Member States on border control through the Frontex Agency constitutes an important step towards the development of the system. Moreover, with the External Borders Fund, the Union expresses solidarity through financial assistance to those Member States that apply the Schengen provisions on external borders and visa. It is against this background that the Commission, in its proposal on the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020, suggested to set up an Internal Security Fund, as part of a simplified two-Fund structure for future expenditure in the home affairs area which also includes the creation of an Asylum and Migration Fund. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. Work on the preparation of the future financial instruments for home affairs started in 2010 and continued into 2011. It was completed in July 2011 and brought together available evaluation results for the existing financial instruments and informed the problems, objectives and policy options, including their likely impact, examined in the impact assessment. On the basis of this study, the Commission drafted an impact assessment report. The main conclusion may be summarised as follows: to broaden the scope of action for Union funding in the field of asylum and migration, including as regards its external dimension, to work towards more simplification of delivery mechanisms and greater flexibility, notably to respond to emergencies. In the area of internal security, stakeholders considered that the broad thematic priorities have already been fixed by the 2009 Stockholm Programme and the 2010 Internal Security Strategy. A future funding mechanism should therefore be defined comprehensively, comprising law enforcement, border guards and customs communities. The need to make greater use of relevant Union agencies, such as Europol and Frontex was also considered important. There was broad support to reduce the number of financial instruments to a two-Fund structure on the condition that this leads to simplification. Stakeholders also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The creation of the Internal Security Fund requires the adoption of two legislative instruments which jointly constitute the Fund. This overall structure was chosen in light of the Treaty obligations. It is not legally possible to draw up one single comprehensive legislative proposal for an Internal Security Fund, despite the coherence of the policy objectives to be addressed. The Internal Security Fund is therefore created as a comprehensive financial framework which is composed of two separate acts, setting up the different components of the Fund and laying down the objectives, the eligible actions and the envelopes of each component: - A Regulation setting up, as part of the Fund, the component for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management; - This Regulation setting up, as part of the Fund, the border management and common visa policy component. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission proposes to establish the instrument for financial support for the management of external borders and the common visa policy as part of the Internal Security Fund. Jointly with the future Regulation establishing as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management, this Regulation establishes for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 the Internal Security Fund. Main objectives : the general objective of the Instrument shall be to contribute to ensuring a high level of security in the European Union. Within the general objective, the Instrument shall contribute - in line with the priorities identified in relevant EU Strategies, programmes, threat and risk assessments - to the following specific objectives: supporting a common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel, ensure equal treatment of third country nationals and tackle irregular migration; supporting borders management , to ensure, on one hand, a high level of protection of external borders and, on the other hand, the smooth crossing of the external borders in conformity with the Schengen acquis. To achieve these objectives, the instrument shall contribute to the following operational objectives: support and reinforce the national capabilities in the area of border control and visa policy and thus expressing financial solidarity with the tasks entrusted to individual Member States at external borders and in consulates in the interest of the border-free area as a public service provided to the Union (national programmes, including ""operating support""); finance the development of the smart border package , i.e. the setting up of an EU Entry Exit System (EES) and an EU Registered Traveller Programme (RTP); finance the introduction and operation of the European Border Surveillance System, EUROSUR , notably through the purchase of equipment, infrastructure and systems in Member States; reinforce the Schengen governance and the evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis by (a) funding the operation of that mechanism under direct management; (b) introducing conditionalities based on compliance with the Schengen acquis for the disbursement of operating support to Member States and (c) requiring Member States to (re)allocate resources received for programmes under this instrument with priority to remedy weaknesses if these have been identified under the mechanism; boost the operational potential of the Frontex Agency by inviting Member States to earmark additional resources under their programmes for specialised equipment which can be put at the disposal of the Agency for its joint operations; support the development and implementation of the relevant Union policies in the EU, in and with third countries under ""Union actions"", thus improving the overall management of migration flows to the Union (projects managed either directly, such as studies or pilot projects to reinforce co-operation with third countries, or indirectly, in accordance with the Financial Regulation; have readily available adequate resources to provide emergency assistance in case of situations of urgent or exceptional migratory pressure; continue support for the functioning of the Specific Transit Scheme for Lithuania , in accordance with the obligations of the EU10, providing support to compensate for foregone fees from transit visas and additional costs incurred by Lithuania in implementing the Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) scheme, such as replacing and upgrading equipment, IT systems, training and operational costs. For each of these objectives, key indicators are defined. It should be noted that actions related to the temporary and exceptional reintroduction of border control at internal borders as referred to in the Schengen Borders Code are not eligible. Implementation : the Commission envisages to give the implementation tasks of this programme to the Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT-Systems in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice (IT Agency). This Regulation would in this case be amended at the appropriate time to include the tasks specifically in the mission of the Agency. Allocation of Funds : in view of the above, the allocation of funding under shared management is based on a combination of: a basic amount allocated to the Member States at the start of the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF); a flexible amount to be added to the basic amount, allocated in two phases. (1) The basic amount is allocated to the Member States at the start of the next MFF and calculated on the basis of objective criteria and needs. It is 60% of the overall envelope for national programmes and the allocations are laid down per Member State in Annex I of this Regulation. They are based on the 2010-2012 calculations under the External Borders Fund, whilst incorporating a minimum amount for each Member State. This will ensure some continuity with the current MFF and give the Member States financial stability to plan their national multiannual programmes. (2) The flexible amount will be added to the basic amount depending on the willingness of each Member State to finance under its national programme actions that respond to specific Union priorities. These specific actions are defined in Annex II and can be amended. In principle, it would be allocated in two phases: at the start of the MFF, as part of the policy dialogue and negotiations on the national programmes of the relevant Member States, and during a mid-term review in 2017. This mid-term review would be the occasion to re-examine the situation in Member States and to allocate new resources for the remaining years of the MFF (2018-2020). Mid-term review : this mid-term review would be the occasion to re-examine the situation in Member States and to allocate new resources for the remaining years of the MFF (2018-2020). These risk/needs assessments could be produced with the help of the Frontex Agency. Member States who, on the basis of these assessments, have more needs or face increased risks will receive an additional amount, thereby giving tangible expression to the principle of solidarity and responsibility-sharing. Union agencies : to use more effectively the competences and expertise of relevant Union agencies in the home affairs field, the Commission also envisages to make use of the possibility offered by the Financial Regulation to entrust, with the resources available under this Regulation, the implementation of specific tasks to such agencies, in the framework of their missions and in complementarity to their work programmes. For the tasks covered under this Instrument this concerns in particular: (i) the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex Agency), for activities in and outside the Union requiring operational expertise on border control;(ii) the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), for activities such as training on asylum addressed to border guards; (iii) the European Police Office (Europol) and the European Police College (CEPOL) in the light of interagency co-operation of law enforcement authorites with border guards; (iv) the Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT-Systems in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (IT Agency) insofar as the development of new IT systems is concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the Commission's proposal for the next multi-annual framework includes a proposal of EUR 4 648 million (in current prices) for the Internal Security Fund for the period 2014-2020. Within this global envelope, the resources available for the implementation of this specific Regulation amount to EUR 3,520 million. Indicatively: about 61% of this amount (EUR 2 150 million) should be used for national programmes of Member States and the support to the Special Transit Scheme implemented by Lithuania; 31% (EUR 1 100 million) should be dedicated to the development of the smart border package and the remainder should then be available to fund Union actions, emergency actions and technical assistance, whilst taking into account also the contributions expected from the Schengen associated countries, which would be added to the total envelope. Moreover, outside the scope of the Internal Security Fund, a separate envelope of EUR 822 million (current prices) is set aside for the management of existing large scale-IT systems (Schengen Information System II, Visa Information System and Eurodac). The management of these systems will gradually be transferred from the Commission to the future Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT-Systems in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (IT Agency) after it begins operations in late 2012. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to supplement or amend provisions in this instrument regarding the definition of specific actions under the national programmes the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council."

The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the 143 EU agricultural, fish and industrial WTO tariff-rate quotas. The aim is to maintain the full existing volume of each tariff quota in the future, but to divide it between two separate customs territories: the EU-27 and the UK. The principle behind the applied methodology is based on trade flows to the EU-27 and the UK during a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. The negotiations with Norway resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 7-8 July 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a comprehensive EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, was established by Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. This framework aims at facilitating the free movement of motor vehicles and trailers in the internal market by laying down harmonised requirements designed to achieve common environmental and safety objectives. Directive 2007/46/EC covers motor vehicles for the carriage of passengers (category M) and of goods (category N), and their trailers (category O), as well as their systems and components. As part of the commitments the Commission made in its CARS2020 Action Plan for a strong, competitive and sustainable European car industry, the EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles has been the subject of a comprehensive fitness check in 2013. Although the fitness check confirmed that the existing regulatory framework has its merits in meeting policy objectives, it has come under harsh criticism after the discovery that a German manufacturer (VW) had for several years used software to manipulate the emission performance of its cars. Within a week of the outbreak of the scandal, the Commission announced that it would reinforce the type-approval system, in particular by ensuring adequate supervisory mechanisms to ensure a correct and harmonised application of the type-approval procedures. Triggered by the outburst of the VW emissions scandal, the European Parliament adopted on 27 October 2015 a Resolution on emission measurements in the automotive sector, calling on the Commission for significantly strengthening the current EU type approval regime including more EU oversight, in particular with regard to market surveillance, coordination and follow up regime for vehicles sold in the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment of the VW emissions crisis on the review of the type-approval framework for motor vehicle. Already before the outburst of the VW crisis, the Commission was working on proposals to improve the type-approval legislation for motor vehicles, and identified main areas with a significant potential for improvement to better address the problems of unsafe and non-compliant automotive products. The assessment of the possible policy options resulted in the conclusion that regulatory action in these areas would be the most effective. The re-assessment of these policy options in the light of the VW crisis has highlighted the need to further increase their effectiveness in terms of detecting and preventing non-compliance problems. There is a warranted need for EU wide supervision to achieve a harmonised and co-ordinated enforcement based on commonly applicable criteria and uniformly applied by Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to replace Directive 2007/46/EC. It sets out the harmonised rules and principles for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and the individual vehicle approval. The proposal aims to strengthen the existing type-approval framework, by introducing market surveillance provisions. It also contains a wide range of measures relating to: the traceability of products and role and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain; responsibilities of and co-operation between the different national authorities involved in the enforcement of the technical harmonisation legislation for motor vehicles; the quality of the type-approval and conformity assessment tasks carried out by technical services; the post-market safeguard procedures and the provisions for the recall of vehicles, procedures for ensuring conformity of production. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary implication of this proposal is estimated at EUR 40.104 million (including administrative expenditure) for the period 2017-2020. In view of the constraints of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, the implementation of the legislative proposal will have to be built on existing resources and to be designed in such a manner that additional financial resources under the EU budget are not needed. For the period following 31 December 2020, the amount shall be subject to the multiannual financial framework in force for the period commencing in 2021. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in a single market in which products circulate freely through 27 Member States, market surveillance needs to be highly coordinated and capable of reacting rapidly over a huge area. However, market surveillance has not kept pace with developments in the Union regulatory framework. Whilst advances have been made over the last decade, in particular with the implementation of Directive 2001/95/EC (General Product Safety Directive) and Regulation (EC) 765/2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance, the overlap of market surveillance rules and the obligations of economic operators laid down in various pieces of Union legislation has led to confusion on the part of both economic operators and national authorities and has seriously hampered the effectiveness of market surveillance activity in the Union. Different product evaluation requirements and procedures apply depending on the category of product involved. The proposal aims to simplify the rules. It should be noted that in response to calls from the European Parliament, the proposal was added to the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package, which also includes a proposal for a regulation on consumer product safety (replacing the GPSD) and a proposal on multi-annual action plan for market surveillance covering the period 2013-2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an impact assessment and a favourable opinion was delivered by the Impact Assessment Board in 2012. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 33, 114 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims at clarifying the regulatory framework for market surveillance in the field of non-food products. It merges the rules on market surveillance of the GPSD, Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and many sector-specific pieces of Union harmonisation legislation into a single legal instrument that applies horizontally across all sectors. The main aims are as follows: · to reduce the number of pieces of legislation containing market surveillance rules : the 3 tier system spread across the GPSD, Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and a range of sector-specific legislation will be reduced to a one tier system in which all those rules are brought together in a single instrument; · to eliminate overlaps in the current system: the new regulation will (a) dispense with the distinction between consumer and professional products for market surveillance purposes; (b) avoid making a distinction between harmonised products and non-harmonised products except where this is unavoidable in applying certain specific provisions. To the greatest extent possible the applicable rules will be the same for all products; · to dovetail the RAPEX and Union evaluation procedures : at present, there are two separate procedures operating, sometimes in parallel, which require Member States to notify to the Commission and to other Member States certain market surveillance action taken at national level. This is an especially problematic aspect of the overlapping categories of products mentioned above. Under the new Regulation the two procedures become a single procedural flow with certain events triggering a single notification to the other Member States and the Commission (made using either the proven RAPEX rapid alert system or the Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance in accordance with the distinction made in the Regulation). In urgent situations the Commission is empowered to adopt measures requiring consistent action across the EU against products presenting a serious risk; · to make the legislation more accessible: current market surveillance provisions are not based around a chronological flow of events. The new Regulation sets out the whole process of a market surveillance exercise in a chronological, sequential manner. It presents a chain of events, incorporating relevant provisions on publication of information, notification etc. at each stage of the procedure. This approach substantially improves the accessibility and user-friendliness of the legislation, and hence its effectiveness. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications are already envisaged in existing or proposed programmes and the initiative will be financed through redeployment of existing resources. According to the financial statement, the total appropriations (operational appropriations, human resources and administrative expenditure) amount to EUR 39 276 million in commitments for 2015-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: medium combustion plants are used for a wide variety of applications (including electricity generation, domestic/residential heating and cooling and providing heat/steam for industrial processes, etc.) and are an important source of emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The approximate number of medium combustion plants in the EU is 142 986. Emissions of air pollutants from medium combustion plants are generally not regulated at EU level. The Commission considers it appropriate to complement the existing legislation relating to combustion plants with provisions for this category. The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ""A Clean Air Programme for Europe"" calls for action to control emissions of air polluting substances from combustion plants with a rated thermal input between 1 and 50 MW, thereby completing the regulatory framework for the combustion sector also with a view of increasing the synergies between air pollution and climate change policies. The present proposal is part of the new framework of action in the field of air quality in the EU, as set out in the revised EU Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution, and is consistent with and reinforces the Europe 2020 objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the analysis concluded that there is a need to propose a legislative instrument for controlling emission from such plants at EU-level. Out of the five policy options considered and in depth analysed to control emissions from medium combustion plants, the preferred option would set emission limit values in line with those set in Directive 2010/75/EU for plants between 50-100 MW and in a number of Member States, and complemented with a number of emission limit values set out for new plants in the amended Gothenburg Protocol. CONTENT: the proposed Directive seeks to lay down emission limit values to control emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter into the air from medium combustion plants as minimum standards of protection for the environment and for all citizens of the EU. It introduces minimum requirements, keeping the administrative burden at the lowest possible level and taking special account of the situation of SMEs. In concrete terms, the proposal: sets out the obligation of the competent authority to register medium combustion plants, based on notification by the operator; sets out the emission limit values apply to existing combustion plants after a fixed period (from 1 January 2025 emissions into air of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from an existing medium combustion plant with a rated thermal input above 5 MW shall not exceed the emission limit values; from 1 January 2030 emissions into air of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from an existing medium combustion plant with a rated thermal input of 5 MW or less shall not exceed the emission limit values); requires Member States to apply more stringent emission limit values to individual plants in zones not complying with air quality limit values; lays down a provision to require operators to immediately report on non-compliance to the competent authority; obliges Member States: (i) to ensure that the operator and the competent authority take necessary measures in case of non-compliance with this Directive; (ii) introduces requirements for Member States to provide for a system of environmental inspections of medium combustion plants covered by this Directive, or implement other measures to check compliance thereof; provides for the obligations of the operator and the competent authority in case of changes to a medium combustion plant; is concerned with the right of access to information and refers to Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on public access to environmental information; requires Member States to designate the competent authorities responsible for carrying out the obligations arising from this Directive; establishes a reporting mechanism. While Member States' first report to the Commission, due by 30 June 2019, shall contain a summary of data of key importance in implementing this Directive, the following reports shall contain qualitative and quantitative information on the implementation of this Directive; lays down the provisions on penalties applicable to breaches of the national provisions enacted pursuant to the proposal.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels establishes a general prohibition to the practice of 'shark finning', whereby the fins are removed from sharks, with the remainder of the shark being discarded at sea. In recent years, some shark populations have been severely targeted and put under serious threat as a result of a dramatic increase in demand for shark products, fins in particular. The EU has made several international commitments to protect sharks, in line with the Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and in particular under the International Plan of Action on Sharks (IPOA-Sharks)adopted by the FAO in 1999. The FAO IPOA was the basis for the 2009 Commission Communication on a European Community Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, whereby the Union committed itself to adopt all necessary measures for the conservation of sharks and to minimize waste and discards from shark catches. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the European Commission held a public consultation of stakeholders and the general public, between 2010 and 2011, in order to gather information on the most appropriate manner in which Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 should be amended. The results of the consultation show that the 'fins-remain-attached' approach is regarded as the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 allows Member States to issue special fishing permits allowing processing on board, whereby shark fins can be removed from the bodies. In order to ensure the correspondence between the weight of fins and bodies, a 'fin-to-carcass' weight ratio is established. However, given that such processing takes place on board vessels, fins and bodies can be landed in different ports. Inspectors must rely on logbook records to determine whether or not the fin allowance has been respected. In such cases, and given the varying levels of control and enforcement in ports around the world where such landings take place, 'shark finning' can and does occur, and is often difficult to detect, let alone prove in legal proceedings. Under these circumstances, the collection of data (e.g. species identification, population structure) underpinning scientific advice for the establishment of fisheries management and conservation measures is hampered. The Scientific, Technical, and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) acknowledges the problem of shark finning and calls for its eradication without exemption, and advises that all elasmobranch species should be landed with fins /wings attached. Regional Fisheries Management Organisations are increasingly addressing the issue of shark finning and their scientific bodies are showing preference for the landing of sharks with their fins naturally attached to the body. Therefore, in order to ensure proper management and conservation of shark stocks, it is appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: as part of the reform of external action financial instruments for 2007‑2013, Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 established the Instrument for Stability (IfS) to enable the Community to give a consistent and integrated response to crises and impending crises, by means of a single legal instrument with simplified decision-making procedures. The review of the implementation of the Regulation concluded that certain amendments to the Regulation are necessary, which may be summarised as follows: (1) taking account of a judgment of the Court of Justice : when the IfS Regulation was adopted, the Council and the Commission issued a joint statement in which they agreed that nothing in this Regulation shall be construed as prejudging positions taken in Case 91/05 (Commission vs Council on measures to combat the proliferation, illicit use of and access to small arms and light weapons and which may be implemented by the Community under its development policy). Only in the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice did the Commission decide to amend the disputed article (Article 3(2)(i)) to clarify it as part of the revision of the instrument. It is therefore necessary to propose a revision of the IfS Regulation in order to bring it in line with the case law of the Court which considers that measures against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons may be implemented by the Community under its development policy. For the same reason, Article 4(1)(a) on action in support of the fight against the illicit trafficking needs to be revised in order to refer explicitly to “small arms and light weapons”. (2) extend the participation of partners from developed countries for certain actions : Article 17 of the Regulation excludes partners from developed countries outside the EU and the EEA from participating in actions in support of pre- and post-crisis capacity building (crisis preparedness) under the Regulation. Thus such partners are precluded from participating in these actions, which is inconsistent and poses a serious setback to the attainment of objectives of Article 4(3). It is therefore proposed to open up participation in the award of procurement or grant contracts under Article 4(3) to participation on a global basis. (3) amend the allocation of the IfS financial envelope : Article 24 of the Regulation specifies that no more than 7% of the overall reference amount shall be allocated to measures falling under Article 4(1), namely threats to law and order, to the security and safety of individuals, to critical infrastructure and to public health. The share of the financial envelope intended for such measures has proven to be inadequate and needs to be increased, as the areas covered by this Article are numerous and, even with multi-purpose programmes, only a few can be handled effectively with the scarce resources available. Developing effective actions in the area of critical infrastructure, public health risks and global responses to trans-regional threats requires more substantial measures to allow real impact, visibility and credibility. It is therefore proposed to increase the maximum share for measures under Article 4(1) from 7% to 10%. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

In its Communication of 3 July 2009 , it examined the role played by derivatives in the financial crisis and, in its 20 October 2009 Communication , it set out the future policy actions the Commission intended to propose to increase transparency of the derivatives market, reduce counterparty and operational risk in trading and enhance market integrity and oversight. In September 2009, G-20 Leaders agreed in Pittsburgh that all standardised OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by end-2012 at the latest and that OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories. In June 2010, G20 Leaders in Toronto reaffirmed their commitment and also committed to accelerate the implementation of strong measures to improve transparency and regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way. This initiative is part of a larger international effort to increase the stability of the financial system in general, and the OTC derivatives market in particular. Given the global nature of the OTC derivatives market an internationally coordinated approach is crucial. This proposal for a Regulation delivers the Commission's commitments to proceed rapidly and with determination. It takes also into account the strong support and the many of the measures suggested in Parliament’s Resolution of 15 June 2010 , on ""Derivatives markets: future policy actions"". It is also consistent with the recently adopted US legislation on OTC derivatives, the so-called Frank-Dodd Act. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that the largest net benefits would be achieved through the adoption of measures that would: require the use of Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing for OTC derivatives that meet predefined eligibility criteria; set specific targets for legal and process standardisation; set specific targets for the bilateral clearing of OTC derivatives transactions; require market participants to report all the necessary information on their OTC derivatives portfolios to a trade repository or, if that would not be possible, directly to regulators; and require the publication of aggregate position information. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). A uniform process at EU level is needed to determine which OTC Derivatives are eligible for mandatory clearing through CCPs. CONTENT: the scope of the Regulation is wide and lays down uniform requirements covering financial counterparties, non-financial counterparties (exceeding certain thresholds) and all categories of OTC derivative contracts. Its prudential parts apply to central counterparties as a result of the clearing obligation and, for the reporting requirement, to trade repositories. The authorisation and supervision requirements for CCPs apply irrespective of the financial instrument the CCPs clear - whether OTC or other. Exemptions are explicitly foreseen for the members of the European System of Central Banks, public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt and to multilateral development banks. The main features of the proposal are as follows: Clearing, reporting and risk mitigation of OTC Derivatives: 'standardised' contracts will mean those contracts that are eligible for clearing by CCPs. In order to apply this, the Regulation establishes a process that will take into account the risk aspects connected to mandatory clearing. In order to establish a process that ensures that as many OTC contracts as possible will be cleared, the Regulation introduces two approaches to determine which contracts must be cleared: a 'bottom-up' approach, according to which a CCP decides to clear certain contracts and is authorised to do so by its competent authority, who is then obliged to inform the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) once it approves the CCP to clear those contracts. ESMA will then have the powers to decide whether a clearing obligation should apply to all of those contracts in the EU. ESMA will need to base that decision on certain objective criteria; a 'top-down' approach according to which ESMA, together with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), will determine which contracts should potentially be subject to the clearing obligation. This process is important to identify and capture those contracts in the market that are not yet being cleared by a CCP. Counterparties that are subjected to the clearing obligation cannot simply avoid the requirement by deciding not to participate in a CCP. If those counterparties do not meet the participation requirements or are not interested in becoming clearing members, they must enter into the necessary arrangements with clearing members to access the CCP as clients. Furthermore, CCPs should not be allowed to accept only those transactions concluded on execution venues with which they have a privileged relationship or which are part of the same group. As regards non-financial (corporate) counterparties, they will in principle not be subject to the rules of this Regulation, unless their OTC derivatives positions reach a threshold and are considered to be systemically important. The Regulation sets out a process that helps to identify the non-financial institutions with systemically important positions in OTC derivatives and subjects them to certain obligations specified under the Regulation. The process is based on the definition of two thresholds: a) an information threshold and b) a clearing threshold. These thresholds will be specified by the European Commission on the basis of draft regulatory standards proposed by ESMA, in consultation with the ESRB and other relevant authorities. Moreover, as not all OTC derivatives will be considered eligible for central clearing, there remains a need to improve arrangements and the safety of those contracts that will continue to be managed on a so-called 'bilateral' basis. The Regulation therefore requires the use of electronic means and the existence of risk management procedures with timely, accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral, and an appropriate and proportionate holding of capital. Lastly, financial counterparties and non-financial counterparty above the clearing threshold must report the details of any derivative contract they have entered into and any modification thereof (including novation and termination) to a registered trade repository. In the exceptional case that a trade repository is not capable of recoding the details of a particular OTC derivatives contract, the Regulation requires that this information should be provided directly to the relevant competent authority. The Commission will need to be empowered to determine the details, type, format and frequency of the reports for the different classes of derivatives, following draft technical standards to be developed by ESMA. Requirements applicable to CCPs: given that CCPs have to assume additional risks, the Regulation requires that, for security reasons, they are subjected to rigorous organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements (internal governance rules, increased capital requirements, etc.). To begin with, a CCP must have in place robust governance arrangements. These will respond to any potential conflicts of interest between owners, management, clearing members and indirect participants. The role of independent board members is particularly relevant. Secondly, to be authorised to exercise its activity, a CCP is required to have a minimum quantum of capital. The Regulation will require a CCP to have a mutualised default fund to which members of the CCP will have to contribute. Authorisation and supervision of trade repositories : the Regulation provides for a reporting requirement of OTC derivative transactions to increase the transparency of this market. The information must be reported to trade repositories. In view of the central role of trade repositories in the collection of regulatory information, the Regulation gives ESMA the powers to register trade repositories, withdraw the registration and to perform the surveillance of trade repositories. Requirements for trade repositories:  the Regulation also contains provisions for trade repositories to guarantee their compliance with a set of standards. These are designed to ensure that the information that trade repositories maintain for regulatory purposes is reliable, secured and protected. In particular, trade repositories will be subject to organisational and operational requirements and ensure appropriate safeguarding and transparency of data."
440EP7,"""""Movement of persons with a long-stay visa""""",0.439,0.799,0.86,0.194,0.152,0.94,0.8,0.714,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to facilitate the circulation within the Schengen area without internal borders of third-country nationals legally residing in one of the Member States on the basis of a long-stay ""D"" visa issued by that Member State. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with the current Schengen acquis, a third-country national holding a national long-stay visa (""D visa"") for stays exceeding three months is allowed to stay only in the territory of the Member State which issued the visa and, pursuant to Article 18 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement, as amended by Regulation 1091/2001, is allowed to transit through the territories of the other Member States only in order to reach the State which issued the visa. Thus, according to present Community law, D visa holders are not allowed to travel to the other Member States during their stay and nor are they allowed to transit through the other States when returning to their country of origin, as this is not provided for by the Schengen Convention. The wording of the above provision of the Schengen Convention stems from the procedure generally applied at the time by the Member States whereby D visas are converted into a residence permit after arrival on the territory. On the basis of such a residence permit, third country nationals can then circulate within the Schengen area. For this reason, at the time of the conclusion of the Schengen Convention, Member States did not consider it necessary to regulate either the circulation and the return journey on the basis of a D visa, or a second transit to the Member State that had issued the D visa. Therefore, the Schengen Convention only provides the principle of equivalence between Schengen residence permits and visas applicable in the Schengen area: a residence permit issued by a Member State allows a third country national, holding the residence permit and a valid travel document, to move freely for up to three months within the territories of the other Member States during his/her stay. Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 also provides for the possibility for third country nationals in possession of a valid residence permit issued by a Member State to cross the external borders of another Member State without a visa for stays not exceeding three months. However, in practice this situation caused serious problems. More and more Member States do not replace D visas by residence permits after the entry of third-country nationals into their territory, or replace them only with considerable delays. Therefore, the Commission proposes the introduction of the principle of equivalence between long-stay and short-stay visas issued by the Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis in order to overcome the present problems encountered by third-country nationals legally staying in a Member State with a long-stay visa. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: this proposal and the parallel draft Regulation extend the principle of equivalence between a residence permit and short-stay visas to long-stay D visas. Hence a long-stay visa would have the same effects as a residence permit as regards circulation in the Schengen area. Principle : a third-country national holding a long-stay D visa issued by a Member State could travel to the other Member States for three months in any half year, under the same conditions as the holder of a residence permit. The rules regarding the issuance of long-stay visas remain unchanged as it was the case with the rules on the issuance of residence permits when the principle of equivalence between a residence permit and a short-stay visa was introduced. This would restore the basic philosophy underlying the Schengen area without internal borders, i.e. that a person can travel around in the Schengen area for short stays for three months in any half year with the document on the basis of which he is legally present in a Member State. Legal aspects : due to the conflicting decision making procedures attached to the different legal basis, the Commission had to draw up two separate proposals. Technically, the proposed Regulations will amend: Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code), on the entry conditions for third-country nationals and Article 21 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement – present proposal for a Regulation based on Article 62 (2)(a) and (3) of the TEC and shall be adopted in accordance with the co-decision procedure; Articles 18 and 25 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 (between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their borders) – proposed parallel Regulation based on Articles 63 (3)(a) of the TEC and shall be adopted at unanimity in the Council after consulting the European Parliament. It should be noted that contrary to the proposed parallel Regulation, this proposed Regulation does not make any changes to important provisions of the Schengen Convention as regards the security aspects (obligation to consult the SIS and the other Member States in case of an alert would also apply when Member States consider the issuance of a long-stay visa to a third-country national or when Member States discover an alert which has been issued to a third-country national who holds a valid long-stay visa). Territorial provisions : Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein are associated with the implementation of this draft Regulation in accordance with bilateral agreements concluded with the EU on the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom and Ireland is not participating in the adoption and the implementation of this text in accordance with the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union. Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. However, it may decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement this Regulation in its national law. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine was signed in Brussels on 4 July 2002 and entered into force on 11 February 2003. The Agreement was renewed for additional periods of five years, with retroactive effect to 8 November 2009 and 8 November 2014 respectively. The Agreement expired on November 7, 2019. Ukraine has a long tradition of excellence in science and technology and despite the difficulties encountered in recent years, the country still has first-class scientists and remains an important player in science, technology and innovation (STI) in the European Union's neighbourhood. Cooperation between the EU and Ukraine is traditionally very active notably in the fields of advanced/new materials, IT-technology, physics and astronomy, engineering, agricultural technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology and their applications across various sectors such as aviation, energy, and biomedicine, in particular immunotherapies for cancer. At the meeting of the EU-Ukraine Joint Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee established by the agreement, held in Kiev on 29 January 2019, both parties noted their intention to renew the agreement for a further period of five years. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the renewal of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine for an additional period of five years with effect from 8 November 2019. The substance of the renewed Agreement shall be identical to the substance of the current Agreement. The renewed Agreement shall not create any new or additional rights or obligations for either Party, but shall extend over time the existing legal regime between the Parties in the field of scientific and technological cooperation. This Decision shall enable both Parties to strengthen cooperation and develop a more strategic partnership by increasing the scale and scope of existing cooperation, addressing global challenges and promoting reciprocal access to programmes and funding. The renewal of the Agreement shall allow both the Union and Ukraine to mutually benefit from the scientific and technological progress achieved through their ongoing cooperation activities. It shall also allow an exchange of specific knowledge and transfer of know-how to the benefit of the scientific community, enterprises and citizens of both parties. The Commission shall regularly monitor all activities carried out under the Agreement, including cooperative activities. The budgetary impact (appropriations of an administrative nature) is estimated at EUR 0.360 million for the period 2019-2024."

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration of 31 October 1958 created a special union within the framework of the Union for the Protection of Industrial Property which was established by the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property signed in Paris on 20 March 1883. The contracting parties undertake to protect on their territories the appellations of origin of products of the other countries within the Special Union which are recognised and protected as such in the country of origin and which are registered at the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), unless those parties declare, within a period of one year from the receipt of the notification of such a registration, that they cannot ensure such protection. Seven Member States are parties to the Lisbon Agreement, namely Bulgaria (since 1975), the Czech Republic (since 1993), France (since 1966), Italy (since 1968), Hungary (since 1967), Portugal (since 1966) and Slovakia (since 1993). Three other Member States have signed, but not ratified the Lisbon Agreement, namely Greece, Spain and Romania. The Union itself is not a party to the Lisbon Agreement as it provides that only countries can accede to it. On 20 May 2015, the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications was adopted which revised the Lisbon Agreement. In order for the Union to be able to properly exercise its exclusive competence for the areas covered by the Geneva Act and its functions in the context of its comprehensive protection systems for agricultural designations of origin and geographical indications, the Union should accede to the Geneva Act and become a contracting party thereto. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the accession of the European Union to the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on designations of origin and geographical indications (Geneva Act). The Geneva Act expands the scope of the Special Union in order to extend the protection of appellations of origin of products to all geographical indications. The revised Agreement:  outlines the terms, conditions and processes by which contracting parties may seek protection for registered appellations of origin and geographical indications, while allowing for appropriate safeguards and transitional periods for certain entities; allows contracting parties, with regard to procedures relating to applications and international registration, to request a declaration of intent to use, if necessary, the protection provided by their national legislation of the Geneva Act and the Common Regulations under the Lisbon Agreement and the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement; increases the registration fees from 500 CHF to 1000 CHF, future flexibility has been introduced to allow Members to further contribute to the budget as required. An individual fee can be required by Contracting Parties in order to covers the cost of substantive examination of the international registration; constitutes the obligation for each Contracting Party to protect registered appellations of origin and geographical indications on its territory, within its own legal system and practice but in accordance with the terms of this Act, subject to any refusal, renunciation, invalidation or cancellation that may become effective with respect to its territory; lays down the content of protection: each contracting party is required to provide the legal means to prevent use of the appellation of origin or geographical indication in respect of goods of the same kind but different origin and in respect of goods not of the same kind or services if such use would indicate or suggest a connection between those goods or services and the beneficiaries, and would be likely to damage their interests, or to impair or dilute or take unfair advantage of, the reputation of the AO/GI; effectively ensures that protected designations may not subsequently become generic; explicitly provides for coexistence of appellations of origin or geographical indications with prior trade mark rights; allows contracting parties to provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark; provides for the option of a phasing out period for prior uses; does not refer to invalidity grounds and hence allows any Contracting Party to invoke its domestic rules, in line with EU legislation, which does not have an enumerative list of invalidation grounds, either. The Geneva Act will enter into force three months after five parties have ratified it."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Vanuatu were opened on 19 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 4 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Vanuatu on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Vanuatu when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Vanuatu to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Vanuatu may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States Scope of the application: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Vanuatu remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Vanuatu reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Vanuatu to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the use of hired vehicles can reduce the costs of undertakings carrying goods on their own account or for hire and reward and at the same time increase their operational flexibility. Directive 2006/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for a minimum level of the market opening for the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road. However, this Directive: allows Member States to restrict the use of hired goods vehicles with a gross vehicle weight above six tonnes for own account operations; restricts the use of a vehicle which has been hired in a Member State different from the one where the undertaking hiring the vehicle is established. The Commission therefore proposes to remove these restrictions and establish a uniform regulatory framework across the EU to ensure equal access for transport operators across the EU to the market for hired vehicles. The proposal is part of a series of proposals in the field of road transport which the Commission intends to adopt in 2017. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option aims to: (i) allow the use of hired goods vehicles for own account operations throughout the EU; (ii) allow the use of goods vehicles which an operator established in one Member State has hired in another Member State for a certain period of time. Expected benefits include: a reduction in operating costs of EU hauliers by a total of EUR 158 million in 2030; a total annual economic benefit of around EUR 240 million in 2030 for the vehicle rental/leasing sector; the creation of almost 5 000 additional jobs (2 900 in the vehicle rental/leasing sector and 1 700 in the road haulage business). CONTENT: the proposal amending Directive 2006/1/EC seeks to: allow the use within its territory of vehicles hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State provided that the vehicle is registered or put into circulation in compliance with the laws of a Member State; allow the use of a vehicle hired in another Member State is to be allowed for at least four months in any given calendar year to enable undertakings to meet temporary or seasonal demand peaks and/or to replace defective or damaged vehicles. By 5 years after the deadline for transposition of the Directive, the Commission shall submit a report on the implementation and effects of this Directive. The report shall include information on the use of vehicles hired in a Member State other than the Member State of establishment of the undertaking hiring the vehicle. On the basis of this report, the Commission shall assess whether it is necessary to propose additional measures."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2008/9/EC (the Refund Directive) allows for non-established taxable persons to reclaim VAT on business expenses incurred in another Member State (the Member State of refund) via an electronic web portal set up in their own Member State (the Member State of establishment). The Refund Directive states that applications should be submitted to the Member State of establishment at the latest on 30 September of the calendar year following the refund period. As the Directive came into force on 1 January 2010, any applications concerning 2009 are to be submitted to the Member State of establishment by 30 September 2010 at the latest. Some Member States opened their web portals very late (up to the middle of May 2010) and there have been various technical problems with the operability and access to certain portals. Member States have also had divergent views of how the system should operate from a technical point of view, which have only come to light once the system has been operational. This has also contributed to a number of delays and problems in the submission and processing of applications. Following a number of problems incurred in the practical application of the procedure at the level of several Member States, it is proposed to amend the Refund Directive in order to: (i) give taxable persons more time to submit applications relating to refund periods in 2009; (ii) provide that the Commission can adopt the necessary implementing measures following the opinion of the Standing Committee on Administrative Co-operation. IMPACT ANALYSIS: as this measure does not significantly amend the existing measure, no impact assessment is necessary. LEGAL BASIS: Article 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal will extend the deadline for submission of a refund application under Directive 2008/9/EC to 31 March 2011 exceptionally for applications concerning refund periods in 2009, and provide for certain implementing measures to be adopted under the procedure provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax. This would allow the Member States and the Commission to agree on the necessary technical aspects of application of the Directive, and hence improve the running of the system. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no negative impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he EU has regulated the installation and use of tachographs since 1970.  The current legislation in place for recording equipment is Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85. Tachographs play a crucial role in checking compliance by professional road transport drivers with the rules on driving time and rest periods. They contribute to improving road safety, drivers’ working conditions and fair competition between road transport companies. A significant share of the vehicles checked by national police or enforcement officers are found to be breaching the social rules. Roughly one fourth of these are found to be breaching tachograph rules. Moreover, there is room to improve further the way in which the (digital) tachograph assists the drivers’ work and supports transport efficiency. Although the introduction of the digital tachograph in vehicles registered after 1 May 2006 has already substantially reduced the administrative burden on the various stakeholders, the annual cost of compliance, estimated to be approximately € 2.7 billion, is still too high. The proposal therefore aims at better enforcement of the social rules and at reducing unnecessary administrative burden, by developing the technical aspects of the tachograph and increasing efficiency. The proposal fits into the policy announced by the Commission in its White Paper on Transport of 28 March 2011. It also contributes to implementation of the Action Plan on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Directive 2010/40/EU on the framework for the deployment of ITS in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy packages were established offering viable policy alternatives for achieving the objectives: Policy Package 1 (PP1) is a technical package aiming simply at improvements of the current tachograph device; Policy Package 2 (PP2) is also a package of technical measures but which would substantially widen the functionalities of the digital tachograph, leading to a new type of digital tachographs; Policy Package 3 (PP3) includes only non-technical measures (such as more trustworthy workshops, making fraud with driver card more difficult, better training of control officers, minimum degree of harmonisation of sanctions, modernised rules on use); Policy Package 4 (PP4) is a combination of technical and system improvement measures (PP2+PP3). The analysis performed suggests that PP4 is the preferred option. T he administrative burden reduction potential of PP4 is €515.5 million, well above the total costs of its full implementation. Therefore the analysis performed suggests that Policy Package 4 should be the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims at amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 with a view to improve the tachograph system. The following main changes will be introduced through the proposed Regulation: Remote communication from the tachograph for control purposes : this measure will give control authorities some basic indications on compliance before stopping the vehicle for a roadside check. Compliant undertakings will avoid unnecessary roadside checks and could thereby benefit from a further reduction of administrative burden. Merge functionalities of driver cards with driving licence : this measure will increase the security of the system as drivers would be less inclined to use their driving licence under fraudulent circumstances. It will also significantly reduce administrative burden. This measure requires minor adaptations of Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on driving licences. Automated recording of precise location through GNSS : this provision will give control authorities more information for checking compliance with social legislation. By using automated recording, it will also help to reduce administrative burden. Integration of digital tachograph in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) : by providing for a harmonised and standardised interface of the tachograph, other ITS applications will have easier access to the data recorded and produced by the digital tachograph. Increase the trustworthiness of workshops : by strengthening the legal framework for the approval of workshops for example with a system of regular and unannounced audits and prevention of conflicts of interest, the trustworthiness of workshops will be increased and the risk of fraud and manipulation reduced. Minimum degree of harmonisation of sanctions : this minimum harmonisation ensures that infringements against the tachograph rules which are classified in EU legislation as ‘very serious infringements’ and as ‘most serious infringements’ will attract the highest category of penalties in national legislation. Training of control officers : the Regulation will require Member States to provide adequate training for their control officers in charge of checking the recording equipment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU’s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the rights and values programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the justice programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The general objective of the proposed rights and values programme is to protect and promote rights and values as enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by supporting civil society organisations, in order to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies. The programme has three specific objectives: (1) Promotion of equality and rights (equality and rights strand) : preventing and combating inequalities and discrimination on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and supporting comprehensive policies to promote gender equality and anti-discrimination and their mainstreaming as well policies to combat racism and all forms of intolerance; protecting and promoting the rights of the child, the rights of people with disabilities, Union citizenship rights and the right to the protection of personal data. (2) Promoting citizens' engagement and participation in the democratic life of the Union (citizens’s engagement and participation strand) : increasing citizens’ understanding of the Union, its history, cultural heritage and diversity; promoting exchange and cooperation between citizens of different countries and citizens’ civic and democratic participation. (3) Combating violence (Daphne strand) : preventing and combating all forms of violence against children, young people and women and violence against other groups at risk; and supporting and protecting the victims of such violence. The programme shall provide for and accelerate the synergies between its different specific objectives in order to increase their potential to reach citizens. To be effective, the programme shall take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. Proposed budget : the programme’s overall budget is set at EUR 641.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount shall be allocated as follows: EUR 408.7 million for the ‘equality and rights’ and ‘fight against violence’ strands; EUR 233 million for the citizen engagement and participation strand."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the conditions for making fertilisers available on the internal market have been partially harmonised through Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Virtually all product-types currently included in the existing Fertilisers Regulation are conventional, inorganic fertilisers, typically extracted from mines or chemically produced in line with a linear economy model. These processes are both energy consuming and CO2-intensive. Around 50 % of the fertilisers currently on the market are left out of the scope of the Regulation. This is true for a few inorganic fertilisers and for virtually all fertilisers produced from organic materials, such as animal or other agricultural by products, or recycled bio-waste from the food chain. As a result, fertilisers sourced in line with the circular economy remain non-harmonised. Their access to the single market is therefore dependent on mutual recognition between Member States, which is often difficult due to diverging national rules. Furthermore, the existing Fertilisers Regulation fails to address environmental concerns arising from contamination by EC-fertilisers of soil, inland waters, seawaters, and ultimately food. The ex-post evaluation of the existing Fertilisers Regulation conducted in 2010 concluded that the Regulation could be more effective in promoting innovative fertilisers, and that adjustments would also be needed to better protect the environment. The Commission proposes to establish harmonised conditions for making fertilisers made from recycled or organic materials available on the entire internal market in order to provide an important incentive for their further use. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment compared status quo (referred to as option 1) with four other policy options. Under the four options, the scope of harmonisation would be extended to fertilisers from organic raw materials and to other fertiliser-related products, and limit values would be introduced for contaminants. The final proposal corresponds with the option that would build on the 'New Legislative Framework' ('NLF'), with one conformity assessment procedure varying between material categories. This was considered to be the best policy choice because it would lead to administrative simplification, in particular for fertilising products from well identified, primary raw materials, and ensure flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that the use of harmonised fertilising products does not pose unacceptable risks to health or the environment. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal the existing Fertilisers Regulation and to address the problems identified in the evaluation conducted in 2010. It has also been identified as one of the key legislative proposals under the circular economy action plan. The main policy objective of the initiative is to incentivise large-scale fertiliser production in the EU from domestic organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model, by transforming waste into nutrients for crops. The draft regulation provides a regulatory framework radically easing access to the internal market for such fertilisers, thereby levelling their playing field with that of mined or chemical fertilisers produced in line with a linear economy model. This would contribute to the following circular economy objectives by: allowing valorisation of secondary raw materials, hence enabling improved use of raw materials and turning eutrophication and waste management problems into economic opportunities for public and private operators; increasing resource efficiency and decrease import dependency for raw materials essential to European agriculture, in particular phosphorus; boosting investment and innovation in the circular economy, hence creating jobs in the EU; contributing to relieving the fertilisers industry from its current pressure to reduce CO2-emissions under ETS, by allowing it to produce fertilisers from less carbon-intensive feedstock. A second policy objective is to address the issue of soil and food contamination and introduce harmonised cadmium limits for phosphate fertilisers . The Regulation introduces strict limits for cadmium in phosphate fertilisers. The limits will be tightened from 60 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg after three years and to 20 mg/kg after 12 years, reducing health and environmental risks. To achieve these objectives , the proposal: sets out the subject matter, scope and definitions, as well as the fundamental principles of free movement and marketability of CE marked fertilising products. The provision on product requirements are contained in the Annexes, which include the substantive requirements for the categories of end products in accordance with their intended function (Annex I), as well as for the categories of component materials that can be contained in CE marked fertilising products (Annex II). Annex III specifies the labelling requirements; lays down the obligations of economic operators involved in making CE marked fertilising products available on the market; sets out the general principle for conformity of CE marked fertilising products. It refers to Annex IV, which describes in detail the conformity assessment procedures applicable to CE marked fertilising products, depending on their component material categories and their product function categories. It also refers to Annex V, which sets out the model structure for the EU declaration of conformity. sets out the provisions on notified bodies, and on market surveillance. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment was adopted on 21 December 1989 and became fully applicable as from 1 July 1995. It sets out basic requirements that PPE must comply with in order to be made available on the EU market. The PPE Directive applies to PPE that is defined as “any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards”. While the directive has successfully achieved its objectives in creating a single market and ensuring a high level of protection for users of PPE, certain problems have been encountered in its implementation. These concern products on the market that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, diverging approaches of the notified bodies, the effectiveness of the market surveillance as well as risks related to protective equipment which is currently not covered by the PPE Directive. The proposal modifies and clarifies a number of the provisions of the existing Directive and aligns it with the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF implementation package adopted on 21 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option consists of amending the PPE Directive as it: (i) lead to an improved level of protection of the health and safety of the users; (ii) ensures a more effective work of the market surveillance authorities and consequently reduces the non-compliant products; (iii) does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies. CONTENT: this proposal intends to replace Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment by a Regulation. Its general objectives are to ensure a high level of protection of human health and safety whilst guaranteeing fair competition for economic operators on the Union market and simplifying the regulatory environment in this area. The proposal also clarifies a number of provisions of the existing Directive and aligns it with those of the Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (decision on the new legislative framework). Scope : the Commission proposes to enlarge the scope of the current PPE Directive by deleting the exclusions of PPE designed and manufactured for private use against heat, damp and water. The proposal keeps the other existing exclusions and clarifies that it does not apply to PPE for head, face or eye protection, subject to the relevant UNECE Regulation, of users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles. Two PPE specific definitions have been added in order to clarify the applicable conformity assessment procedures: “Individually adapted PPE” and “Made-to-measure PPE”. Making available on the market, free movement, obligations of economic operators, CE marking : the proposal: contains the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision; obliges the manufacturer of PPE to draw up a technical documentation and to ensure that the PPE is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity or a simplified EU declaration of conformity. Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for conformity assessment bodies (notified bodies). It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies with the individual Member State. Categories and Conformity assessment : the proposal simplifies the definition of the categories of PPE. The category only depends on the risk against which the PPE is intended to protect. Provisions are set out for made-to-measure PPE. PPE intended to protect the user against drowning, cuts by hand-held chain-saws, high-pressure cutting, bullet wounds or knife stabs, and harmful noise are subject to the most stringent conformity assessment procedure. Minor amendments have been made which change marginally three essential health and safety requirements (EHSR) in order to remove requirements shown to be impracticable or that create confusion. Application : the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies and Member States time to adapt to the new requirements. However, the designation of notified bodies pursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation. Transitional provisions are foreseen for products manufactured and the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 89/686/EEC so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

BACKGROUND: according to Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College (CEPOL), CEPOL has its seat in Bramshill, United Kingdom. By letters of 12 December 2012 and 8 February 2013, the United Kingdom informed CEPOL that it no longer wishes to host the seat on its territory. Apart from hosting CEPOL, Bramshill also hosts a national police training site of the National Policing Improvement Agency which the United Kingdom decided to replace by a new College of Policing to be located elsewhere. The United Kingdom has therefore decided to close the national police training site at Bramshill and to sell the site indicating that the related costs were high and no alternative business model to run the site had emerged. In view of this situation, on 8 October 2013, the Council agreed by common accord on arrangements to host CEPOL according to which CEPOL will be hosted in Budapest as soon as it moves from Bramshill. This agreement should be incorporated in Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment of locating CEPOL seat in Budapest demonstrates that the proposal complies with the pertinent criteria, allowing the European Parliament and the Council to assess the impact of the relocation and the functioning of CEPOL in Budapest. The assessment addresses those factors in detail that: have a financial impact on the general budget of the European Union and cover social aspects of the work of CEPOL staff members. Moreover, the headquarters offered by Hungary for the purposes of the seat of the CEPOL are situated in the city centre of Budapest. Due to the central location of Budapest, it is easily accessible from most European capitals by cost-effective flights. The building proposed satisfies the requirements laid down by Secretariat of CEPOL. Hungary also proposes to offer, free of charge, a number of services and installations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Article 4 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA and proposes the new seat of CEPOL to be established in Budapest, Hungary. The specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to estimated savings in CEPOL’s functioning costs per year due to the proposed relocation from Bramshill to Budapest as well as an estimated tentative budgetary calculation of the one-off expenditure of the relocation. The savings amount to EUR 203 500/year. The estimated tentative budgetary calculation of the one-off expenditure for relocating CEPOL from Bramshill to Budapest amounts to EUR 1 875 449."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Council agreed, in its conclusions of 9 March 2012, to propose a joint quantified emission reduction commitment of 20% for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for the Union. In December 2012, at the Doha Climate Change Conference, the 192 Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted an amendment to the Protocol. This ‘Doha Amendment’ establishes a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020, with legally binding emission reduction commitments for the Parties listed in its Annex B. The agreement on the Doha Amendment came as part of a broader package. Under the Doha Amendment, the European Union, its Member States and Iceland commit to limit their average annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the years 2013 to 2020 to 80 % of their base year emissions (mostly 1990). The Doha Amendment also makes further amendments to the text of the Protocol to be implemented in the second commitment period. these amendments concern: (i) the inclusion of a new gas - nitrogen trifluoride (NF3); (ii) an ‘ambition mechanism’ which provides for a simplified procedure which allows a Party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during a commitment period; (iii) a provision which automatically adjusts a Party’s target to prevent an increase in its emissions for the period 2013 to 2020 beyond its average emissions for the years 2008 to 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision provides the basis for the conclusion of the Doha Amendment by the European Union and sets out the terms of the joint fulfilment of the commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland. It is accompanied by a proposal for a regulation on technical issues related to implementation by the EU and Member States of the second commitment period. The ratification Decision enables the EU, as a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, to ratify the Doha amendment. It also sets out the terms according to which the EU, its Member States and Iceland will fulfil the 20% emissions reduction commitment jointly. The formal entry into force of the Doha Amendment is an important objective for the European Union. The Commission would like Member States to take the necessary steps to complete their domestic ratification processes not later than 16 February 2015. Once they have finalised their own ratification processes, Member States together with the EU, will simultaneously deposit their instruments of acceptance to enable simultaneous entry into force for all of them. This should take place well before the Paris Climate Change Conference at the end of 2015. On the international level, the Doha amendment will enter into force when it has been ratified by three quarters of Parties to the Protocol (144 of the 192 Parties). The European Union is a Party to the Protocol in its own right, as are all Member States and Iceland. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the budget of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in March 2006, the European Council stressed the need for a better balance between work and private life in order to achieve economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness, and approved the European Pact for Gender Equality. In December 2007 and March 2008, the Council called on the Commission to evaluate the legal framework supporting reconciliation and the possible need for improvement in this area and reiterated that further efforts should be made to reconcile work with private and family life for both women and men. The European Parliament has consistently called for improvements to the existing legislation relating to the protection of pregnant workers and the granting of parental leave, and for measures to improve the reconciliation of professional, private and family life (for example, in its resolution of 21 February 2008 on the demographic future of Europe, Parliament called on the Member States to adopt best practices as regards the length of maternity leave and in its resolution of 27 September 2007, it urged the Member States to mutualise the costs of maternity and parental leave allowances in order to ensure that women no longer represent a more costly source of labour than men. This is why the Commission has finally decided to review Directive 92/85/EEC on pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding and is proposing to revise it. CONTENT: the proposed Directive amends the existing Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, and in particular its Articles 8 (Maternity leave), 10 (Prohibition of dismissal) and 11 (Employment rights). 1) Maternity leave : Article 8 is amended so as to increase the duration of maternity leave to 18 weeks, 6 of which must be taken after childbirth. This corresponds to the length of leave provided for in the ILO Maternity Protection Recommendation, adopted in 2000, and is intended to generally improve the health and safety of women giving birth to a child. This increase is designed to allow women to recover from pregnancy and childbirth, to have more time with their children, and to be able to breastfeed for a longer period. Under the current Directive the duration is 14 weeks, 2 weeks of which are compulsory before or after confinement. Other measures related to maternity leave are as follows : women falling within the scope of the Directive would be able to choose freely the time at which the non-compulsory portion of the leave is taken (before or after childbirth), and would thus no longer be obliged to take a specific portion of the leave before childbirth as is presently the case in some Member States. It is for the Member States to decide on notification periods; where childbirth occurs after the due date, the prenatal portion of the leave is extended to the actual date of birth, without any reduction in the post-natal portion of the leave, in order to guarantee that women have sufficient time to recover from giving birth and to breastfeed; the Member States are to decide on the length of additional leave to be granted in the event of premature childbirth, children hospitalised at birth, new-born children with disabilities and multiple births. The extra time should allow women to recover from the particular stress that premature childbirth, children hospitalised at birth, the birth of children with disabilities and multiple births usually cause; any period of sick leave, up to 4 weeks before confinement, in the event of illness or complications arising out of pregnancy or childbirth shall not shorten the period of maternity leave, again in the interest of women's health. Prohibition of dismissal : points 1 and 2 of Article 10 are amended: in order to take account of the case law of the European Court of Justice, it is proposed to prohibit all preparations for a possible dismissal not related to exceptional circumstances, during the maternity leave. Under the current Directive, the employer must duly substantiate the grounds for such dismissal in writing only in cases where a woman is dismissed while on maternity leave. The proposed amendment extends this duty of the employer to cases where a woman is dismissed within 6 months of the end of her maternity leave, if the woman requests such a written motivation. The aim of this provision is not to amend any rules on individual or collective dismissal, but only to provide, in the interest of both the business and the worker concerned, that during a certain period after the return from maternity leave, any dismissal should be duly motivated in writing if the worker so requests. Employment rights : the new point 2(c) of Article 11 makes it clear that following maternity leave, the woman has the right to return to the same job or to an equivalent post on terms and conditions that are no less favourable, and the right to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which she would have been entitled during her absence. This is taken from Directive 2002/73/EC, as recast in Directive 2006/54/EC. Rights relating to the employment contract : the new point 2(c) of Article 11 makes it clear that following maternity leave, the woman has the right to return to the same job or to an equivalent post on terms and conditions that are no less favourable, and the right to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which she would have been entitled during her absence; point 3 modifies the existing rule on the payment given during maternity leave: it provides for the principle of the payment of the full monthly salary received prior to the maternity leave. However, this is not mandatory since this payment may be subject to a ceiling, to be determined by the Member State, provided that it is not set below the rate for sick pay. Member States may determine if the level of the payment during maternity leave corresponds to the one of the last monthly salary before maternity leave or to an average to be calculated over a certain period; according to new point 5 of Article 11, a worker during maternity leave or when returning from maternity leave has a right to ask her employer to adapt her working patterns and hours to the new family situation and the employer is obliged to consider such a request. However, the employer has no obligation to accept or follow-up on the request. The detailed rules on the exercise of this right are to be laid down by the Member States. Burden of proof, retaliation measures : the provision on the burden of proof is common to most Directives on equal treatment between women and men. In judicial procedures, the general rule is that a person who alleges something must prove it. However, in equal treatment cases, it is often extremely difficult to obtain the evidence necessary to prove the case, as it is often in the hands of the respondent. The provision on victimisation is also commonly found in equal treatment Directives. Effective legal protection must include protection against retaliation. Victims may be deterred from exercising their rights on account of the risk of retaliation, and individuals must therefore be protected from any adverse treatment where they exercise the rights conferred by the Directive. Penalties : in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice, the provision on penalties provides that there should be no upper limit on the compensation payable in the event of a breach of the principle of equal treatment. This provision does not require criminal penalties to be introduced. Provide a higher level of protection in the Member States : the proposal reaffirms the standard provision, which allows the Member States to provide a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive and confirms that there should be no lowering of the level of protection already afforded by the Member States when implementing it. It also stipulates that Member States shall ensure that the body or bodies designated for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on grounds of sex shall be competent in addition for issues falling within the scope of this Directive, where these issues pertain primarily to equal treatment and not to the worker's health and safety. This provision gives the Member States a period of 2 years to transpose the Directive into national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: Article 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""delegated acts"" (Article 290(3)). Under Article 291 of the TFEU, Member States adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""implementing acts"" (Article 291(4)). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact analysis since the proposal to align Council Regulations (EC) No 2008/97, (EC) No 779/98 and (EC) No 1506/98 with the TFEU is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he objective of the present proposal consists in aligning three Council Regulations in the field of imports of olive oil and other agricultural products from Turkey with those provisions of the TFEU. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred upon the Commission under those regulations need to be aligned. It is necessary to re-classify the powers conferred upon the Commission into delegated and implementing powers and to amend the regulations above. In order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 2008/97, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of the resulting adjustments necessary for that Regulation where the present conditions of the special arrangements provided for in the Association Agreement are amended, in particular as regards the amounts, or where a new agreement is concluded. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 2008/97, (EC) No 779/98 and (EC) No 1506/98, the relevant implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to ensure connectivity between the EU and the UK after the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 126 of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and to guarantee the continuity of the activities of railway undertakings established and licensed in the UK operating on the cross-Channel fixed link, Regulation (EU) 2020/2222 established measures to ensure the continuity of EU cross-border rail services with the UK. Regulation (EU) 2020/2222: - extended until 30 September 2021 the period of validity of the licences issued by the United Kingdom to rail operators established in its territory, as well as that of the safety certificates issued to those undertakings by the Intergovernmental Commission established pursuant to the Treaty between the UK and France concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a channel fixed link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 (the ‘Treaty of Canterbury’); - extended the period of validity of the safety authorisation of the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager issued by the said Intergovernmental Commission until 28 February 2021. Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council empowers France and the United Kingdom to conclude an international agreement concerning the construction and operation of a Channel Fixed Link (‘the Treaty of Canterbury’) as regards the application of railway safety rules within the Channel Fixed Link. However, no agreement has been concluded yet or is likely to be concluded soon. In this context, France and the UK have negotiated a cross-border agreement on safety certificates. France has also negotiated a cross-border agreement on the licensing of railway undertakings. Additional time is needed to complete the formal procedures required under the law of both Parties for the provisional application or entry into force of these agreements. These procedures are expected to extend for six months after the expiry, on 30 September 2021, of the contingency measures currently in force. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/2222 aims to extend the contingency measures concerning the validity of licences and safety certificates in order to ensure the continuity of operations on the Channel fixed link.

BACKGROUND: on 28 July 2011, the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organisation ('DSB') adopted the Appellate Body Report and the Panel Report as modified by the Appellate Body Report in the case ‘European Communities — Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Certain Iron or Steel Fasteners from China' (‘Reports’). In the Reports, it was found that Article 9(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 ('the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation') was inconsistent with Articles 6.10, 9.2 and 18.4 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement. Article 9(5) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation provides that individual exporting producers in non-market economy countries which do not receive market economy treatment pursuant to Article 2(7)(c) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation will be subject to a countrywide duty rate unless such exporters can demonstrate that they meet the conditions for individual treatment laid out in Article 9(5) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. On 18 August 2011 the European Union notified the DSB that it intends to implement the recommendations and rulings of the DSB in this dispute in a manner that respects its WTO obligations. On 19 January 2012 the European Union and China agreed that the reasonable period of time for implementing the DSB recommendations and rulings would be 14 months and two weeks from the date the DSB adopted the Reports. The reasonable period of time will therefore expire on 12 October 2012. The purpose of this legislative proposal is to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings on Article 9(5) of the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal provides that Article 9(5) of the Regulation will be amended to state that an anti-dumping duty will be imposed in the appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis on imports of a product from all sources found to be dumped and causing injury, except for imports from those sources from which undertakings under the terms of the Regulation have been accepted. The Regulation imposing anti-dumping measures shall specify the duty for each supplier or, if that is impracticable, the supplying country concerned. Suppliers which are legally distinct from other suppliers or which are legally distinct from the State may nevertheless be considered as a single entity for the purpose of specifying the duty. Account may be taken of factors such as the existence of structural or corporate links between the suppliers and the State or between suppliers, the control or material influence by the State in respect of pricing and output, or the economic structure of the supplying country.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has been set up by Regulation (EC) 294/2008 with the objective of contributing to sustainable economic growth and competitiveness by reinforcing the innovation capacity of the EU and its Member States through the full integration of the knowledge triangle. According to the provisions of the Regulation, and based on a draft proposal from the EIT, the Commission shall adopt before the end of 2011 a proposal for adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda, which will define long-term priority fields for the EIT, including an overview of the planned higher education, research and innovation activities, for a period of seven years. The EIT submitted its first draft Strategic Innovation Agenda to the Commission before 30 June 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment. However, the preparation of the proposal took account of the responses to the open public consultation on the EIT as well as the results of the open public consultation. Member States and a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and civil society expressed strong support for the mission of the EIT to drive more and better cooperation between the worlds of higher education, entrepreneurship, research and innovation. According to respondents: · the EIT should play a distinctive role in 'Horizon 2020', the future EU Programme for Research and Innovation, and forge closer links with other European and national efforts; · the EIT should continue to ensure the participation of businesses in its work since this is important for the future success of the EIT; · flexibility, clarity on rules and clear returns on investment are fundamental in order to attract private sector participation; · the concept of integrating the knowledge triangle, as well as the themes around which the EIT is structured, is regarded as highly relevant; · there is much support for the model which has been developed by the EIT, based around long-term highly integrated networks of co-location centres; · lastly, the merit of the KICs is to act as a catalyst for creating additional value from the activities which individual members already undertake on a more fragmented basis. LEGAL BASIS: Article 173(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to adopt the Strategic Innovation Agenda of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology as set out in the annex. It builds on the provisions laid down in the EIT Regulation and complements the proposals included under the Horizon 2020 package. 1)Achievements : the Commission notes that the EIT has completed its initial phase, and has been successful in reaching its main objective - the full integration of the entire innovation chain, bringing together higher education institutions, research organisations and businesses via three initial Knowledge and Innovation Communities, established in 2010 in areas identified by Council and Parliament as essential to Europe's future development: (i) sustainable energy ('KIC InnoEnergy'), (ii) climate change adaptation and mitigation ('Climate KIC') and (iii) future information and communication society ('EIT ICT Labs'). The current three KICs have succeeded in achieving critical mass in their respective areas. The combined strength of partners in a KIC – both in number and in the weight they represent in their respective fields – gives them the potential to be world class. 2) Priorities for 2013 onwards : drawing on the lessons of setting up the initial KICs, the Commission considers that the bottom-up approach should be maintained since it offers substantial leeway to each KIC to organise their partnerships, but further guidance should be given to identify suitable legal set-ups. In the future, clearer guidance should be given upstream from the selection process to ensure that essential strategic features are shared by all KICs, while allowing for differentiated approaches in KICs organisation, delivery and funding approaches. It is important also to enhance the role of the EIT as an investor in the knowledge triangle and enhance the growth and influence of existing KICs. Lastly, the current total number of three KICs does not yet provide the critical mass for the EIT to develop its full potential as a leading innovation Institute. Therefore, in the period 2014-2020, new KICs will therefore be set up in two waves, i.e. three new KICs each in 2014 and 2018, leading up to a portfolio of nine KICs in the period 2014-2020. Three themes have been identified for the first wave in 2014: · innovation for healthy living and active ageing · raw materials – sustainable exploration, extraction, processing, recycling and substitution · food4future - sustainable supply chain from resources to consumers. For the second wave in 2018, the remaining themes (urban mobility, added-value manufacturing and smart secure societies) will be considered. 3) Effective decision-making : the governance model of the EIT has proven its overall value. However, experiences from the initial period show that further efforts can be made to enhance the effectiveness of the EIT's decision-making and implementing mechanisms. The relationship between the EIT Governing Board, responsible for strategic decisions, and the EIT headquarters, responsible for implementation, has to be more clearly defined and streamlined. The EIT headquarters will have to define the critical domains where the EIT should provide support to the KICs, striking an appropriate balance between supporting and monitoring functions. Lastly, the Governing Board needs to better ensure that strategic decisions are properly informed by the experiences from the KICs and the wider innovation community. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the legislative financial statement attached to the proposal amending the Regulation establishing the EIT sets out the budgetary, human and administrative resource implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise unable to access printed material must have equal access to books and printed material in order to fully and effectively participate in society. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired: 39 million are blind and 246 million have low vision. The World Blind Union reports that in Europe only 5% of published books are available in an accessible format for visually impaired persons, while in developing countries – where approximately 90% of visually impaired people live – this rate is as low as 1%. Since January 2011, the European Union has been bound by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This enshrines the right of access to information (Article 21) and the right of people with disabilities to participate in cultural life on an equal basis with others (Article 30). The Convention has become an integral part of the EU legal order. Twenty-five Member States are parties to the Convention and three countries are finalising ratification. In 2009, negotiations began in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) on a possible international treaty introducing limitations and exceptions to copyright for the benefit of people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled, with the objective of facilitating the cross-border exchange of books in accessible formats. On 26 November 2012, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to participate in these negotiations, on behalf of the European Union. The WIPO negotiations were successfully concluded at the diplomatic conference held in Marrakesh between 17 and 28 June 2013. These led to the adoption of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled on 27 June 2013. The Council authorised the signature of the Treaty on behalf of the European Union on 14 April 2014. It is now necessary to conclude this Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal calls on the Council to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled. Objectives of the Treaty: the Treaty establishes a set of international rules which ensure that there are limitations or exceptions to copyright at national level for the benefit of people who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print-disabled and enable the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies of published works that have been made under an exception or limitation to copyright in any of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty. Main provisions: Definition and scope: the Treaty defines: - the beneficiaries: they are people who are blind, have a visual impairment or a perceptual or reading disability, or are otherwise unable, due to physical disability, to hold or manipulate a book, or focus or move their eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for reading; - works: as literary and artistic works within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, in the form of text, notation and/or related illustrations, whether published or otherwise made publicly available in any media. By virtue of an agreed statement, this also covers audiobooks; - an accessible-format copy: as is a copy in an alternative manner and form compared to the format in which the work has been published and which gives beneficiaries access to the work as comfortably as sighted people could access it. The accessible-format copy must be used exclusively by beneficiaries and it must respect the integrity of the original work. Accessible format copies made under a limitation or exception to copyright may be exported by ‘authorised entities’, defined as government institutions or other organisations that provide education, instructional training, adaptive reading or information access to blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print-disabled persons on a non-profit basis. These entities must ensure that they only distribute accessible formats to beneficiaries, that they discourage the reproduction, distribution and making available of unauthorised copies and that they maintain due care in, and records of, their handling of the copies. Production obligations of accessible format copies: the Treaty obliges every Contracting Party to provide, in their national copyright laws, for a limitation or exception to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to the public, to facilitate the availability of works in accessible formats for the Treaty’s beneficiaries. Contracting Parties may decide to limit such limitations or exceptions to cases where accessible format copies are not commercially available on reasonable terms to beneficiaries in their territory. ‘Three-step test’: Contracting Parties may only allow accessible format copies to be exported, if they ensure that relevant limitations or exceptions to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to the public are subject to the ‘three-step test’. This means that either they must be a party to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) or they must otherwise ensure that the relevant limitations or exceptions are limited to certain special cases which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. Import authorisation: the Treaty clarifies that, to the extent a Contracting Party permits a beneficiary or an authorised entity to make an accessible-format copy of a work, it should also permit accessible-format copies to be imported. Contracting Parties are obliged to take appropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure that when they provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures, this legal protection does not prevent the beneficiaries from enjoying the limitations and exceptions provided for in the Treaty. Protection of privacy: the Treaty also requires Contracting Parties to protect the privacy of beneficiaries and to cooperate in order to facilitate the cross-border exchange of accessible-format copies. WIPO will set up an information access point to assist authorised entities in identifying one another with a view to working together. The Treaty also encourages authorised entities to provide information on their policies and practices to interested parties and to members of the public. Ratification procedure and entry into force: the Treaty confirms that Contracting Parties are free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the Treaty within their own legal system and practice. However, they must comply with existing international obligations under the Berne Convention, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT). The Treaty will enter into force once twenty Contracting Parties have ratified it. Other specific provisions: the Treaty also: Competence of the EU: the EU may become a party to the Treaty, having made the declaration during the Marrakesh diplomatic conference, that it is competent in respect of, and has its own legislation binding on all its Member States on matters covered by this Treaty and that it has been duly authorised, in accordance with its internal procedures, to become party to the Treaty. The European Union signed the final act of the diplomatic conference on 28 June 2013 and signed the Treaty on 30 April 2014 in Geneva."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: by Decision of 30 November 2009, the Council concluded the agreement between the European Community and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver. Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition. With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with Antigua and Barbuda were successfully finalised by the initialling of the amending agreement on 28 October 2016. CONTENT: this proposal is presented to the Council to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement between the European Community and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver. The amendments introduced by the final agreement cover the following points: Duration of stay: the final agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Antigua and Barbuda when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). A joint statement on the interpretation of the 90-day period over any 180-day period is attached to the amending agreement. Suspension of the agreement: the agreement provides that suspension of the waiver shall be lifted if the suspension is no longer required. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Community and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver remain unaffected by the amending agreement, including the territorial scope. The provisions of the agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland."
9727EP8,"""""Labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters """"",0.9,0.882,0.02,0.542,0.115,0.91,0.037,0.192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to increase the safety, health protection, and the economic and environmental efficiency of road transport by promoting fuel-efficient and safe tyres with low noise levels. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: road transport was responsible for about 22% of the Union’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2015. Tyres, mainly because of their rolling resistance, account for 5% to 10% of vehicles’ fuel consumption. In 2009, the EU adopted two sets rules relating to tyres: Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters (the Tyre Labelling Regulation, TLR). The TLR, which set out Union requirements harmonising the information on tyre parameters to be provided to end-users allowing them to make informed purchasing choices; Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles (the General Safety Regulation, GSR), which put in place harmonised technical requirements that tyres must satisfy before they can be placed on the Union market. The Commission has reviewed the effectiveness of Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 and identified the need to update its provisions to improve its effectiveness by modifying and enhancing some of its provisions to clarify and update their content, taking into account the technological progress for tyres over recent years. Improving the labelling of tyres will give consumers more information on fuel efficiency, safety and noise, allowing them to obtain accurate, relevant and comparable information on those aspects when purchasing tyres. This will help improve the effectiveness of the tyre labelling scheme so as to ensure cleaner, safer and quieter vehicles and to maximise the scheme’s contribution to the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Tyre labelling forms part of Union legislation on the energy efficiency of products. This initiative is in line with the Union's energy policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option revealed the following estimated impacts: (i) increased turnover for business of EUR 9 billion per year by 2030; (ii) 129 PJ annual fuel savings by 2030; (iii) 10 Mt annual CO2-eq savings by 2030; (iv) decreased noise emission from tyres and resultant health benefits; and (v) greater safety and fewer accidents. CONTENT: this proposal aims to repeal and replace Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 on labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters. It establishes a framework for the provision of harmonised information on tyre parameters through labelling, allowing end-users to make an informed choice when purchasing tyres. The proposal aims in particular to: update the tyre label and allowing for its revision : the label covers three parameters: rolling resistance, wet grip and external rolling noise. The classes for these parameters need to be adjusted, to take account of technological progress. The Commission may adopt delegated acts to supplement the Regulation, and to adapt the annexes in the light of technical progress; improve the visibility of the label to consumers: all tyres placed on the market must be accompanied by a label, whether in the form of a separate document or of a sticker; the full label will have to be shown when tyres are sold on the internet and in paper-based distance selling; require that information on the snow and ice performance of tyres be included on the label; allow for the future inclusion of mileage and abrasion , if appropriate, as a parameter for the label. Tyre abrasion is a major source of microplastics released into the environment; require that the label be shown in visual advertisements and technical promotional material; extend to C3 tyres the requirement for the label to be shown; require tyre manufacturers to subject the label declaration to the type approval process thus providing an additional guarantee of the correctness of the label: improve enforcement by creating an obligation to register tyres in the product database established under Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 (supplier identification, model of tyre, label, parameter classes and product information sheet)."
5352EP7,"""""Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide""""",0.123,0.941,0.93,0.29,0.182,0.892,0.923,0.057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a new financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide 2014-2020 in the framework of the reform of the EU external action financial instruments and following on from previous EIDHR . PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability The present Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights (Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union). Furthermore, as also provided in the Treaty, the Union's action on the international scene “shall be guided by the principles which have inspired its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.” (Article 21). Therefore, the promotion of democracy and human rights is an essential aspect of the EU’s external action. In promoting human rights and democracy worldwide, the EU is using a wide range of measures, from political dialogue and diplomatic initiatives to financial and technical cooperation and assistance. The Regulation on establishing a European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)1 constitutes a corner stone of this political strategy and is a unique and visible expression of the EU’s strong commitment to democracy and human rights. The instrument has generated genuine results and numerous success stories, providing support to civil society and human rights institutions worldwide as well as election observation. Due to its independence from Government consent and its flexibility, the EIDHR represents a key added value to the EU’ policy toolbox. The general objectives and the scope of the EIDHR which are to contribute to the development and consolidation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law worldwide, must be preserved in the new Regulation. Recent developments in the European Neighbourhood, in particular the Arab Spring, have shown that there is a strong home-grown demand for increased freedoms and rights together with democracy that the ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered three options (with some sub-options): Option 1 : No separate EIDHR Regulation and mainstream human rights and democracy under other instruments; Option 2 : no change to the current regulation with only an increase in the budget allocation that will provide for additional activities under the current framework; Option 3 : building a better enabling regulation, while preserving the key features of the existing Regulation. The third option was retained as it would allow preserving the political and operational benefits of the instruments, while allowing for a better adaptation of the regulation. Under this option, the new draft should be built as a better enabling regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 202 and 209 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this draft Regulation proposes to establish a new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights under which the Union shall provide assistance to the development and consolidation of Such assistance shall aim in particular at: enhancing the respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international and regional human rights instruments, and strengthening their protection, promotion and monitoring, mainly through support to relevant civil society organisations, human rights defenders and victims of repression and abuse; supporting and consolidating democratic reforms in third countries, by enhancing participatory and representative democracy, strengthening the overall democratic cycle, and improving the reliability of electoral processes, in particular by means of election observation missions. Scope and fields of action : Union assistance shall relate to the following fields: support to and enhancement of participatory and representative democracy, including parliamentary democracy, and the processes of democratisation, mainly through civil society organisations; promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international and regional instruments concerning civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, mainly through civil society organisations; strengthening of the international framework for the protection of human rights, justice, the rule of law and democracy, and for the promotion of international humanitarian law; building confidence in and enhancing the reliability and transparency of democratic electoral processes, while contributing to the efficiency and consistency of the whole electoral cycle. The promotion and protection of gender equality, the rights of the child, rights of indigenous peoples, rights of persons with disabilities, and principles such as empowerment, participation, non-discrimination of vulnerable groups and accountability shall be taken into account whenever relevant for all assistance measures referred to in this Regulation. The assistance measures shall take into account the specific features of crisis or urgency situations and countries or situations where there is a serious lack of fundamental freedoms, where human security is most at risk or where human rights organisations and defenders operate under the most difficult conditions. Geographical scope : the assistance measures shall be implemented in the territory of third countries or shall be directly related to situations arising in third countries, or shall be directly related to global or regional actions. General Framework for programming and implementation : Union assistance under this Regulation shall be implemented through the following measures and in accordance with the Common Implementing Regulation: Strategy Papers and revisions thereof as appropriate; Annual Action Programmes, individual measures and support measures; Strategy papers shall set out the priority areas selected for financing by the Union during the period of validity of this Regulation, the specific objectives, the expected results and the performance indicators. They shall In accordance with the Council decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service (EEAS)5 , the High Representative/Vice-President shall ensure overall political coordination of the Union’s external action, including through the EIDHR. In particular, the EEAS shall contribute to the programming and management cycle of the EIDHR. Implementation : the implementation has been greatly simplified as an Article stipulates that the decision shall be implemented in accordance with the future Regulation establishing common implementation rules for external relations financing instruments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the instrument proposed is part of the measures to be implemented under the Heading IV ""Global Europe"" of the European Union's Multiannual Financial Framework. The financial envelope for the implementation of this Regulation for the period 2014-2020 shall be EUR 1 578 000 000 (current prices). It corresponds to an approximate average annual envelope of EUR 225 000 000."

CONTENT: the codification of Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94  has been initiated by the Commission. The new Regulation was to have superseded the various acts incorporated in it. In the meantime the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 contains a provision with regard to which such a delegation of power would be opportune. It is therefore appropriate to transform the codification of Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 into a recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Council conclusions of 23 November 1998 and of 5 November 2002 on euro coins intended for collection, the Commission Recommendation 2009/23/EC on common guidelines for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation, and the Commission Recommendation 2010/191/EU on the scope and effects of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins, provide for recommended practices regarding euro collector coins, the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation, including commemorative circulation coins, and consultation prior to the destruction of fit euro circulation coins. The lack of mandatory provisions for issuance of euro coins may result in different practices among Member States and does not achieve a sufficiently integrated framework for the single currency. In the interest of legal transparency and certainty, it is therefore necessary to introduce binding rules for the issuance of euro coins. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposed Regulation lays down rules on the issuance of euro circulation coins, including commemorative circulation coins, on the issuance of euro collector coins, and on consultation prior to the destruction of fit euro circulation coins. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Apart from regular euro circulation coins, Member States may also issue commemorative euro circulation coins to celebrate specific subjects, subject to limits set per year and issuing Member State for the number of issues of such coins. The proposal establishes certain volume limits for commemorative circulation coins in order to ensure that such coins remain a minor percentage of the total number of the 2-euro coins in circulation. At the same time, these volume limits should allow for the issuance of a sufficient volume of coins to ensure that commemorative coins can circulate effectively. Member States should also be able to issue euro collector coins, which are not intended for circulation and which should be readily distinguishable from euro circulation coins. Euro collector coins should have legal tender status only in the Member State of issuance and should not be issued with a view to their entry into circulation. In order to ensure that euro collector coins are not confused with euro circulation coins they should be readily distinguishable from the latter. It is furthermore appropriate that issuances of euro collector coins are accounted for in the volume of coins to be approved by the European Central Bank (ECB), but on an aggregate basis rather than for each individual issue. It is appropriate and in line with common practice among participating Member States that euro circulation coins, including commemorative circulation coins, should be put into circulation at face value, although a minor proportion may be sold at a higher price if produced with a special quality or presented in special packaging. In order to avoid that fit euro circulation coins are destroyed by one Member State while there may be a need of such coins in another, Member States should consult each other prior to the destruction of such coins. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."
856EP8,"""""Self-certification of importers of minerals and metals originating in conflict-affected and high-risk areas""""",0.143,0.267,0.92,0.021,0.096,0.881,0.948,0.788,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish an EU system of self-certification for importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: t he European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal notes that international measures exist to promote responsible sourcing of minerals in areas at risk or affected by armed conflict. The two best-known were adopted in 2011 and 2010 respectively: the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Due Diligence Guidance) and Section 1502 of the United States Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which focuses on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and nine adjoining countries. Whilst the trade of conflict minerals is very well documented in the case of the DRC, other cases abound elsewhere in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Against this background, the Commission and the High Representative have been working to develop a comprehensive EU responsible mineral sourcing framework. This work follows up a 2010 European Parliament resolution calling for the EU to legislate along the lines of US legislation as well as two Communications in 2011 and 2012 that announced the Commission's intention to explore ways of improving supply chain transparency. It should be noted that this legislative proposal is accompanied by a Communication detailing other policy measures that can be deployed to tackle the problem as broadly as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission examined six options. The preferred option comprises the adoption of a Regulation establishing obligations under a 'EU Responsible Importer' certification based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance – voluntary. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to help reduce the financing of armed groups and security forces through mineral proceeds in conflict-affected and high-risk areas by supporting and further promoting responsible sourcing practices of EU companies in relation to tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold originating from such areas. The draft regulation lays down the supply chain due diligence obligations of Union importers who choose to be self-certified as responsible importers of minerals or metals containing or consisting of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, as set out in Annex I. Self-certification as a responsible importer : a ny importer of minerals or metals within the scope of the Regulation may self-certify as responsible importer by declaring to a Member State competent authority that it adheres to the supply chain due diligence obligations set out in the Regulation. The declaration shall contain documentation in which the importer confirms its adherence to the obligations including results of the independent third-party audits carried out. Member State competent authorities shall carry out appropriate ex-post checks in order to ensure that self-certified responsible importers of the minerals or metals within the scope of this Regulation comply with their obligations. OECD Due Diligence Guidance : the Regulation relies on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to define obligations for EU importers that opt to be self-certified as responsible importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten ores and metals, and gold, on the basis of a self-declaration of compliance. EU importers opting for self-certification are obliged to integrate all elements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance in their management system by: (i) maintaining a system of controls and transparency over the mineral supply chain, which includes inter alia the country of mineral origin and the smelters/refiners; (ii) identifying and assessing risks in the supply chain against the OECD model supply chain policy; (iii) designing and implementing a strategy to respond to identified risks; (iv) obtaining independent third-party audit assurances of supply chain due diligence; and (v) reporting publicly on supply chain due diligence. Disclosure : the EU self-certified importer is required to disclose annually to the Member State competent authority the identity and geographical location of the smelters/refiners in its supply chain. The importer is also required to provide independent third-party audit assurances and pass them on to Member States' competent authorities and to downstream purchasers, with due regard to business confidentiality and other competitive concerns. On the basis of the information disclosed to the competent authorities, the EU will publish annually, after consultation with the OECD, a list of responsible smelters and refiners that source according to the Regulation. Infringement: in the case of infringement, competent authorities will issue a notice of remedial action to be taken by the EU importer. If such action is inadequate, the authority will then issue a non-recognition notice for the responsible importer certificate for the minerals and metals covered by the draft Regulation. Budgetary implications: the present proposal entails limited financial implications for the Union budget for administrative purposes: EUR 2.72 million for the period 2014-2018."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), under the provisions of Article XIV of the FAO constitution, was approved by the FAO Conference in 1949 and entered into force in 1952. Amendments to this Agreement were approved in 1963, 1976 and 1997. The European Community acceded to the GFCM on 16 June 1998 through Decision 98/416/EC. Mediterranean and Black Sea EU Member States are also parties to this Agreement. The GFCM is a so-called Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO), with the aim of promoting the development, conservation, rational management and best utilization of living marine resources, as well as the sustainable development of aquaculture in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. An amendment of the GFCM Agreement was launched in 2013 following a performance review finalised in 2011, which concluded that the Agreement should be amended to clarify the objectives and functions of the GFCM, and strengthen its efficiency. The amended Agreement was negotiated with the GFCM Contracting Parties. The Council authorised the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Union on matters falling within the Union's competence. The negotiations were carried out by Member States and the Commission as per their respective areas of competence in accordance to the terms of the mandate. The Contracting Parties to the GFCM endorsed the ""Amended Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean"" at the GFCM 38 Annual Session on 19-24 May 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the amended Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission invites the Council to adopt a decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the amended Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. The amended Agreement revises the structure and content of the current one, so as to bring it in line with modern RFMO instruments. Amendment: main changes introduced are as follows: - A clearer explanation of the purpose of the GFCM Agreement: the new Agreement sets a clear overall objective of biological, social, economic and environmental sustainability of living marine resources. It also introduces definitions of the terms that are necessary for the correct interpretation of the Agreement. Better defined functions of the GFCM, which include the promotion of common fishery management through multiannual management plans, the establishment of fisheries restricted areas, and the collection and dissemination of data. In this context, the new Agreement integrates core elements of the Common Fisheries Policy regarding: - Sanctions: the amendment includes provisions for the establishment of measures/sanctions to address non-compliance by Members/non-Members. - Dispute settlements: the establishment of a well-defined dispute settlement mechanism in case disputes arise between Contracting Parties. It should be noted that the text of the amended Agreement will undergo a final legal check by the FAO, which should be finalised in October 2014. The text may therefore undergo changes, which are not expected to be of substance."

BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision. President Barroso therefore requested a group of high level experts, chaired by Jacques de Larosière, to make proposals to strengthen European supervisory arrangements. Building on its recommendations, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009. The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 which proposed: establishing a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs): a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA); and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor and assess potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. The Communication also concluded that in order for the ESFS to work effectively, changes to the financial services legislation would be necessary, in particular to provide an appropriate scope to the more general powers provided for in the individual regulations establishing the authorities, ensuring a more harmonised set of financial rules through the possibility to develop draft technical standards and facilitate the sharing, where necessary, of microprudential information. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanied the legislative proposals, examining the options in more detail. The second impact assessment analysed the options for the appropriate powers for the authorities to work towards achieving a single set of harmonised rules and concluded that this capacity would be rightly limited to those areas to be defined in forthcoming sectoral legislation, and identified such potential areas. Additionally, in developing the draft technical standards themselves, the authorities should undertake appropriate analysis of potential related costs and benefits and consult stakeholders before submitting them to the Commission. LEGAL BASIS: given that changes need to be introduced into existing Directives to ensure the development of a single rule book, an amending Directive is the most appropriate instrument. This amending Directive should have the same legal basis as the Directives it amends, i.e. Articles 50, 53, 62, and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: along with the Regulations establishing the EBA, EIOPA and ESMA and in order for the ESFS to work effectively, changes to the sectoral legislation are necessary. The areas in which amendments are proposed fall broadly into the following categories: definition of the appropriate scope of technical standards as an additional tool for supervisory convergence and with a view of developing a single rule book; to appropriately integrate the possibility for the authorities to settle disagreements in a balanced way to those areas where common decision making processes already exist in sectoral legislation; general amendments which are common to most sectoral legislation and necessary for the directives to operate in the context of new authorities, for example, renaming the level 3 committees to the new authorities and ensuring the appropriate gateways for the exchange of information are present; and additional amendments to the Solvency II Directive. This amending directive is proposed to amend the following legislation: i) Directive 2003/71/EC: Prospectus Directive and ii) Directive 2009/138/EC (the Solvency II Directive). The changes to be made to the Solvency II Directive aim to: to adjust existing level 2 empowerments to the Lisbon Treaty: existing level 2 empowerments should be transformed into empowerments for delegated acts. Appropriate control procedures should be foreseen; provide for transitional requirements in relation to valuation, governance, supervisory reporting and public disclosure, the determination and classification of own funds, the standard formula for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement and the choice of methods and assumptions for the calculation of technical provisions, including the determination of the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure. It is also necessary to enable level 2 measures to specify transitional arrangements in relation to the treatment of third country regimes. The transitional requirements should not result in more favourable treatment for insurance and reinsurance undertakings, or lower protection for policy holders. They should encourage undertakings to move towards compliance with the particular requirements of the new regime as soon as possible; amend level 2 empowerments: in order to allow for greater convergence on procedures for supervisory approvals already provided for in Solvency II (specific parameters, model change policies, special purpose vehicles and the setting and removal of capital add-ons), the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures by means of delegated acts specifying procedure in these areas; include the European Cooperative Society (SCE) in the list of permissible forms of insurance and reinsurance undertakings; introduce an amendment to reflect the adaptation to the Euro amount of the MCR floor for captive reinsurance undertakings; Extend by two months the implementation date in order to better align the start of the various new reporting, calculation and other obligations of the Solvency II regime with the date (31 December) which marks the end of the financial year of the majority of insurance undertakings.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, entered into force on 1 September 2017. A new type of poultry cut consists of a traditional breast cap with the humerus bones of the wings attached and can, after minimal transformation in the Union, be marketed in the Union as poultry breast. Unlimited imports of those cuts, of which imports from Ukraine reached 55 500 tons in 2018, therefore risk undermining the conditions under which traditional poultry breast cuts may be imported into the Union under the Association Agreement, in particular the quantitative restrictions in the form of a tariff rate quota. On 20 December 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Ukraine with a view to finding a solution by amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement. Those negotiations were successfully concluded on 19 March 2019.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current design of the residence permit was adopted in 1997. Back in 2009, Member States considered that more sophisticated forgeries meant it was necessary to work on a new design for residence permits and decided to introduce more modern security features to improve the security features of residence permits. Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 380/2008, lays down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals. During the discussions, it became clear that Member States were not in favour of a completely harmonised document. They insisted on maintaining the list of ‘updated’ additional security features, which could be added to a common ‘uniform’ format if desired. They did not wish to change their systems but preferred to continue with a common ‘uniform’ card with an improved level of security and an updated list of optional (national) security features. ‘Uniformity’ only meant having a uniform design and some standard security features, to which optional national security features could be added. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a new common design for residence permits for third-country nationals with more modern security features in order to render the residence permits more secure and prevent forgery. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to replace the Annex to Regulation (EC) 1030/2002 by a new technical Annex containing the image and the general description of the new residence permit. Transitional period and implementation : to allow existing stocks to be used up, provision is made for a transitional period of six months during which Member States can still use the old residence permits. It is also provided that Member States must introduce the new residence permits nine months after the Commission adopts an implementing decision on the supplementary technical specifications."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: prosecuting offences against the EU budget is currently within the exclusive competence of Member States and no Union authority exists in this area. National law enforcement efforts remain often fragmented in this area and the cross-border dimension of these offences usually escapes the attention of the authorities. Despite the intensified efforts of Union bodies, such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), coordination, cooperation and information exchange face numerous problems which are a major impediment to the effective investigation and prosecution of offences affecting the Union’s financial interests. As Member States' criminal investigation and prosecution authorities are currently unable to achieve an equivalent level of protection and enforcement, the Union not only has the competence but also the obligation to act. Article 86 of the Treaty provides the necessary legal basis for such a new Union-level prosecution system, the purpose of which is to correct the deficiencies of the current enforcement regime exclusively based on national efforts and add consistency and coordination to these efforts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the analysis of the Impact Assessment, setting up the European Public Prosecutor’s Office as a decentralised integrated office of the Union, which relies on national judicial systems, offers the most benefits and generates the lowest costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to create a European Public Prosecutor’s Office, as well as to lay down its competences and procedures. It complements a previous legislative proposal which defines which defines the criminal offences as well as the applicable sanctions. The main elements of the proposed Regulation are the following: Status, organisation and structure: the proposal provides for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office in the form of a Union body with a decentralised structure and with legal personality and sets out its relationship with Eurojust. Independence: among the key features of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the text refers to its independence and accountability to the European Parliament, Council and the European Commission in regard to its activities. In this context, it lays down special rules on the appointment and dismissal of the European Public Prosecutor, his/her Deputies and European Delegated Prosecutors. Tasks and competence: the task of the European Public Prosecutor will be to combat criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union. It shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of, and accomplices in the criminal offences and for exercising the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States in respect of the offences affecting the Union’s financial interests. The proposal lays down the applicable penalties that fall within the material competence of the European Public Prosecutor. These offences are to be defined by reference to national law implementing Union law. Basic principles: the proposal describes the main legal principles that will govern the activities of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, including conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proportionality, national law being applicable to implement the Regulation, procedural neutrality, legality and celerity of investigations, Member States’ duty to assist the investigations and prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. Rules of procedure on investigations, prosecutions and trial proceedings: the proposal covers the essential features of the investigations and prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, including provisions on how they should be controlled by national courts, what decisions the European Public Prosecutor’s Office could take once the investigation is completed, how it would exercise its prosecution functions and how the evidence collected would be used in trial courts. Procedural safeguards: the proposal provides safeguards for suspects and other persons involved in the proceedings of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which will need to comply with the relevant standards, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. With regard to certain rights – right to interpretation and translation; right to information in criminal proceedings; right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and the right to communicate upon arrest – the rules refer to Union legislation. The proposal also defines autonomously other rights which have not yet been regulated in Union legislation, such as the right to remain silent and the right to be presumed innocent, the right to legal aid, the right to present evidence, appoint experts and hear witnesses. As such, these rules provide an additional layer of protection compared to national law. The proposal also lays down the rules governing the data protection regime. The supervision of all personal data processing in the context of the activities of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office has been entrusted to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal seeks to be cost-efficient for the EU budget: part of OLAF's current resources will be used for setting up the central headquarters of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which in turn will rely on the administrative support of Eurojust. Limited additional costs will arise in relation to the position of the European Delegated Prosecutors who will be located in the Member States and will be an integral part of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. As the set-up phase of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office will probably take several years, staff members will be gradually transferred from OLAF to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The European Public Prosecutor's Office will reach cruising speed once the full staff levels are achieved. The full staff level will be achieved in 2023 with 235 staff, of which 180 establishment plan posts and 55 external staff. The estimated cost for 2023 with this staff level is approximately EUR 35 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2014, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America. On 17 July 2015, in the light of the amendments made in the meantime, the Commission presented an initial amended proposal for codification of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 (see the summary dated the same day). Having regard to the amendments adopted in respect of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 and in view of the work already carried out in the course of the legislative procedure, the Commission has decided to present another amended proposal for codification of the Regulation in question. CONTENT: the main elements of the new amended proposal are as follows: Additional rights : the amended proposal stipulates that the tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Union are suspended in respect of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation. It provides the imposition of an additional 4.35 % ad valorem duty on products originating in the United States listed in that Annex. This duty would be in addition to the customs duties applicable under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Union Customs Code. Annual adjustments : the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the United States' Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (‘CDSOA’) to the Union at that time. The Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty or the list in Annex I under the following conditions: the level of nullification or impairment shall be equal to 72 % of the amount of disbursements under the CDSOA relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities; the amendment shall be made so that the effect of the additional import duty on imports of the selected products originating in the United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the level of nullification or impairment ($ 27.81 million); the Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty when the level of suspension cannot be adjusted to the level of nullification or impairment by adding or removing products from the list in Annex I. Another amendment seeks to add the reference to Commission Delegation Regulation (EU) 2017/750 in Annex III.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal relating to the making available on the market of pyrotechnic articles is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2007/23/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts. The proposal does not change the scope of the Directive and the essential safety requirements (apart from one point). The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the pyrotechnic articles are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the pyrotechnic article bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2007/23/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2007/23/EC on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their pyrotechnic articles comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant pyrotechnic article is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
12426EP9,"""""EU-Brazil Agreement on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports""""",0.855,0.83,0.851,0.699,0.491,0.815,0.766,0.854,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement between the European Union and Brazil amending the Agreement between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition . With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with Brazil were successfully finalised on 31 October 2017 by the initialling of the agreements amending the two Agreements between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports, and for holders of ordinary passports. Both parties have agreed to adopt the new definition of 'short-stay', among other technical details, but all amendments are insignificant from the traveller's point of view. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports . The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay : the Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union holding a valid diplomatic, service or official passport and for the citizens of Brazil holding a valid diplomatic, service or official passport when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). The new definition is applied throughout the Agreement. An amendment has been made clarifying that a suspension of the visa waiver shall actually be lifted if the reasons that led to the suspension disappear. On this point, the amendment aligns the wording of the agreement with Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports with that of all other visa waiver agreements signed by the Union in 2015 and 2016. Entry into force : the Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the 6th month following the date on which the last Contracting Party notifies the other that the ratification procedures have been completed. To ensure legal certainty and enable travellers to comprehend the law and to comply with it, a sufficiently long transitional period is necessary. Once ratification of the Agreement has been completed, the six-month period will allow travellers to complete short stays that are still entirely calculated under the old definition, before entry into force of the new short-stay definition and its 180-day backward-looking reference period. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports remain unaffected by the Agreement, including the territorial scope. Territorial application : the provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. The Union has no power to amend visa waiver agreements that would bind the four countries that are associated with the implementation of the Schengen acquis, including the common visa policy. In order to ensure a harmonised approach and implementation of the provisions on the duration of authorised stay in the Schengen area, a joint declaration is included in the Agreement, stating the desirability for Brazil, on the one hand, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, on the other, to accordingly modify their existing bilateral visa waiver agreements."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the ""Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products"", known as the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), was concluded by 29 WTO Member States at the Singapore Ministerial Conference in 1996. The ITA entered into force in the European Union in 1997. Today, the ITA counts 82 participants, or half of WTO Members, and covers 97 % of trade in this sector. The ITA requires that each participant eliminates and binds customs duties at zero on a Most Favoured Nation basis for all information technology (IT) products covered. The ITA covers about 200 tariff lines, including computers, telephones, but also inputs, components and machinery for the production of IT goods. The ITA Ministerial Declaration establishes that participants shall meet periodically under the auspices of the Council on Trade in Goods to review the product coverage specified in the Attachments, with a view to agreeing, by consensus, whether in the light of technological developments, experience in applying the tariff concessions, or changes to the HS nomenclature, the Attachments should be modified to incorporate additional products. In May 2012, several countries proposed to expand the product coverage of the ITA. On 24 July 2015, the text of the ""Declaration on the Expansion of Trade on Information Technology Products"" was agreed, with a view to bind and eliminate customs duties on an additional list of 201 IT products. Annual trade in these 201 products is valued at over USD 1.3 trillion per year, and accounts for approximately 10 % of total global trade today. The participants agreed on the staging commitments for each product listed in document G/MA/W/117. The agreement in the form of a Declaration on the Expansion of the ITA (and the schedules containing the staging commitments of the participants) was adopted by the Ministers of the participant countries on 16 December 2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an economic assessment was made by an external company before the negotiations started. With the final results of the negotiations now known, the Commission has made its own in-house assessment, of which the following three elements are the most important findings: CONTENT: under this draft Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (ITA), together with the schedules submitted by other participants in the negotiations and which are contained in the WTO document G/MA/W/117. The objective of the ITA expansion is to eliminate duties on IT goods not included in the original ITA. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in total the European Union is expected to lose EUR 1.5 billion in duties on IT goods. However, this loss will be spread out over a total of 7 years. Most low duties will be eliminated at entry into force, representing 25 % of duty value. After 3 years more than 60 % of duty will have been phased out, while 30 % will only be eliminated after 7 years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union is a Party to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution following its approval in 1981. The Convention is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to limit and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution and its adverse effects upon human health and the environment in the UNECE region. To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants which aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Union is a Party to the 1998 Protocol following its approval on 19 February 2004. The Parties present at the 27th session of the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted by consensus Decisions 2009/1, 2009/2, 2009/3 and 2009/4 amending the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Decision 2009/3 entered into force and has become effective.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the requirements regarding the presentation of proof of origin for textile products were introduced with a view to ensuring the correct application of measures on products to which quantitative restrictions applied and to avoid market disruption caused by imports from the People’s Republic (PR) of China. Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 provides for the conditions of acceptance of proofs of origin for certain textile products originating in third countries and falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature, listed in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93. In recent years, the import measures applied by the Union to textile products have gradually decreased in their number and impact. Quantitative restrictions on imports originating in countries which are WTO Members were eliminated with the expiry of the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing in 2005. Special safeguard provisions for imports of textiles and apparel products originating in the PR of China and covered by the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) ended on 31 December 2008 and the regime of double-checking surveillance system of imports categories originating in the PR of China expired. The management of imports of textile products from third countries, not members of the WTO, subject to remaining quantitative restrictions is based on import authorisations and not on proofs of origin. The presentation of a proof of origin has no value when a system of surveillance is applied for the categories of products not subject to quantitative restrictions. Given that the products can be imported without any constraints, there is no reason for demanding guarantees regarding their origin. As a consequence, given that the Union trade policy measures in textiles sector are limited and can be managed without proofs of origin, it is proposed to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 and, in parallel, to amend the related provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission looked at two possible options: Option 1 : no legislative action (which does not appear to be consistent with Community law and the recognised need for simplification) and, Option 2 : legislative action (this would contribute to improving the regulatory environment for industry and align the rules relating to textile imports with those of other industrial products, for which the presentation of certificates of origin is not compulsory). The Commission’s preferred option is Option 2 since its objective is to remove from the Union set of rules a legal instrument which is unnecessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal repeals Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 and amends the relevant provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 regarding the conditions of acceptance of proofs of origins. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget as it does not involve any additional expenditure."
5201EP9,"""""Certain aspects of railway safety and connectivity with regard to the Channel Tunnel""""",1.016,0.956,0.946,0.822,0.684,0.907,0.922,0.927,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish interim measures to ensure the continuity of cross-border rail services with the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaries of a Channel fixed link, signed in Canterbury on 12 February 1986, established an intergovernmental committee to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transition period set out in the withdrawal agreement, unless otherwise provided, EU law will no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and, as regards the part of the Channel Fixed Link under French jurisdiction, the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be a national safety authority under Union law. The safety authorisations for the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager and safety certificates for railway undertakings operating through the Fixed Link issued by the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be valid. By Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council, France was empowered to negotiate, sign and conclude an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety and interoperability rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link, with the aim of maintaining a unified safety regime. However, it is unlikely that such agreement will enter into force by the end of the transition period. In the light of the economic importance of the Channel Fixed Link to the EU, it is essential that the Channel Fixed Link continue to operate after 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in view of the end of the transitional period referred to in the withdrawal agreement, the proposed Regulation lays down transitional provisions for certain safety certificates and safety approvals issued under Directive 2004/49/EC and for certain licences of railway undertakings issued under Directive 2012/34/EU. In concrete terms, the proposal: - extends the validity of safety authorisations of the infrastructure manager by two months and the validity of safety certificates and licences of railway undertakings by nine months; - also extends by nine months the validity of the operating licences issued by the United Kingdom under Directive 2012/34/EU in order to allow railway undertakings to continue to operate up to the Calais-Fréthun border-crossing station and thus ensure connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom; - provides that such authorisations, certificates and licences are subject to Directive (EU) 2016/798 and Directive 2012/34/EU respectively and requires their holders of to cooperate with the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority and provide the necessary information; the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority must monitor that the holders of these authorisations, certificates and licences comply with EU law; - confers implementing powers on the Commission to withdraw the benefit conferred on the holders of the approvals/certificates and licences in question, where compliance with EU requirements is not ensured."
4421EP7,"""""Attacks against information systems""""",0.807,0.85,0.0,0.581,0.333,0.807,0.856,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to propose a new legislative framework aimed at combating (large scale) attacks against information systems and to repeal Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in recent years, the number of attacks against IT systems has risen steadily in Europe. Moreover, previously unknown large-scale and dangerous attacks against the information systems of companies, such as banks, the public sector and even the military, have been observed in the Member States and other countries. New concerns, such as the massive spread of malicious software creating 'botnets' - networks of infected computers that can be remotely controlled to stage large-scale, coordinated attacks - have emerged. Such network of compromised computers ('zombies') may be activated to perform specific actions such as attacks against information systems (cyber attacks). These 'zombies' can be controlled – often without the knowledge of the users of the compromised computers – by another computer. This 'controlling' computer is also known as the 'command-and-control centre'. The people who control this centre are among the offenders, as they use the compromised computers to launch attacks against information systems. With regard to cybercrime, the main cause of this phenomenon is vulnerability resulting from a variety of factors. Insufficient response by law enforcement mechanisms contributes to the prevalence of these phenomena, and exacerbates the difficulties, as certain types of offences go beyond national borders. Variations i n national criminal law and procedure may give rise to differences in investigation and prosecution, leading to differences in how these crimes are dealt with. Developments in information technology have exacerbated these problems by making it easier to produce and distribute tools ('malware' and 'botnets'), while offering offenders anonymity and dispersing responsibility across jurisdictions. Given the difficulties of bringing a prosecution, organised crime is able to make considerable profits with little risk. On 24 February 2005, EU Member States agreed a Council Framework Decision (2005/222/JHA) that addresses the most significant forms of criminal activity against information systems, such as hacking, viruses and denial of service attacks. The Framework Decision seeks to approximate criminal law across the EU to ensure that Europe's law enforcement and judicial authorities can take action against this form of crime. Member States were required to take the necessary measures to comply with the provisions of the Framework Decision by 16 March 2007. On 14 July 2008, the Commission published a report on the implementation of the Framework Decision. It was noted that several emerging threats had been highlighted by recent attacks across Europe since adoption of the Framework Decision, in particular the emergence of large-scale simultaneous attacks against information systems and increased criminal use of so-called 'botnets'."" These attacks were not the centre of attention when the Framework Decision was adopted. In response to these developments, the Commission presents this proposal which aims to consider recent technical advances and the new modi operandi found in today's cyber attacks as devise better responses to the threat. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: various policy options have been examined as a means of achieving the objective. Option 1: Status Quo / No new EU action . Option 2: Development of a programme to strengthen the efforts to counter attacks against information systems by means of non-legislative measures : these measures would, in addition to the programme for critical information infrastructure protection, focus on cross-border law enforcement and public-private cooperation. These soft-law instruments should aim to promote further coordinated action at EU level, including strengthening of the existing 24/7 network of contact points for law enforcement agencies; establishment of an EU network of public-private contact points involving cybercrime experts and law enforcement agencies; elaboration of a standard EU service level agreement for law enforcement cooperation with private sector operators; and support for the organisation of training programmes for law enforcement agencies on the investigation of cybercrime. Option 3: Targeted update of the rules of the Framework Decision (new Directive replacing the current Framework Decision) to address the threat from large-scale attacks against information systems (botnets) and, when committed by concealing the real identity of the perpetrator and causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner, the efficiency of Member States' law enforcement contact points, and the lack of statistical data on cyber attacks. Option 4: Introduction of comprehensive EU legislation against cybercrime : this option would entail new comprehensive EU legislation. In addition to introducing the soft-law measures in policy option 2 and the update in policy option 3, it would also tackle other legal problems related to Internet use (such as financial cybercrime, illegal Internet content, the collection/storage/transfer of electronic evidence…) Option 5: Update of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime : this option would require substantial renegotiation of the current Convention, which is a lengthy process and doesn’t seem realistic as there seems to be no international willingness to renegotiate the Convention. The preferred policy option is a combination of non-legislative measures (option 2) with a targeted update of the Framework Decision (option 3). LEGAL BASE: Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Directive, while repealing Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA, will retain its current provisions and include the following new elements: On substantive criminal law in general , the proposed Directive: 1) Penalises the production, sale, procurement for use, import, distribution or otherwise making available of devices/tools used for committing the offences. 2) Includes aggravating circumstances: the large-scale aspect of the attacks - botnets or similar tools would be addressed by introducing a new aggravating circumstance, in the sense that the act of putting in place a botnet or a similar tool would be an aggravating factor when crimes listed in the existing Framework Decision are committed; when such attacks are committed by concealing the real identity of the perpetrator and causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner. Any such rules would need to comply with the principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties and be consistent with existing legislation on the protection of personal data . 3) Introduces ‘illegal interception’ as a criminal offence. 4) Introduces measures to improve European criminal justice cooperation by strengthening the existing structure of 24/7 contact points: an obligation to comply with a request for assistance by the operational contact points (set out in Article 14 of the Directive) within a certain time limit is proposed. The Cybercrime Convention does not specify a binding provision of this kind. The aim of this measure is to ensure that the contact points indicate within a specified time whether they are able to provide a solution to the request for assistance, and by when the requesting point of contact can expect such a solution to be found. The actual content of the solutions is not specified. 5) Addresses the need to provide statistical data on cybercrimes by making it obligatory for the Member States to ensure that an adequate system is in place for the recording, production and provision of statistical data on the offences referred to in the existing Framework Decision and the newly added ‘illegal interception’. Taking account of gravity of the crimes : the Directive contains in the definitions of criminal offences listed in articles 3, 4, 5 (illegal access to information systems, illegal systems interference and illegal interference) a provision allowing to criminalise only 'cases which are not minor' in the process of transposition of the directive into national law. This element of flexibility is intended to allow Member States not to cover cases that would in abstracto be covered by the basic definition but are considered not to harm the protected legal interest, e.g. in particular acts by young people who attempt to prove their expertise in information technology. This possibility to limit the scope of criminalisation should not however lead to the introduction of additional constitutive elements of offences beyond those that are already included in the Directive, because this would lead to the situation that only offences committed with the presence of aggravating circumstances are covered. In the process of transposition, Member States should refrain in particular from adding additional constitutive elements to the basic offences such as e.g. a special intention to derive illicit proceeds from crime or the presence of a specific effect such as causing a considerable damage. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the implications of the proposal for the Union budget are small. More than 90% of the estimated cost of EUR 5 913 000 would be borne by the Member States and there is the possibility of applying for EU funding to reduce the cost."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 provides that the Union budget should continue to support fisheries and maritime affairs policies. Europe's maritime sector employs over 5 million jobs generating almost EUR 500 billion a year, with a potential to create many more jobs. The output of the global ocean economy is estimated at EUR 1.3 trillion and this could more than double by 2030. Fisheries are vital to the livelihood and cultural heritage of many coastal communities in the EU and an essential part of their cultural heritage. Along with aquaculture, it also contributes to food security and nutrition. EU support is a key tool for sustainable fisheries and the conservation of the sea's biological resources, for food security through the supply of seafood, for the growth of a sustainable blue economy and for healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans, notably in the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) for the period 2021-2027. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall be repealed. The new Fund shall support the environmental, economic, social and employment objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), promote the implementation of the Union's maritime policy and support the Union's international commitments in the field of ocean governance. The fund's support shall be based on four priorities: 1. Fostering sustainable fisheries and the conservation of marine biological resources : support from the EMFF shall aim to achieve and maintain sustainable fishing based on the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and to minimise the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem with particular attention to small-scale fishermen. That support shall include innovation and investments in low-impact, climate resilient and low-carbon fishing practices and techniques. Support for fleet adaptation remains sometimes necessary with regard to certain fleet segments and sea basins. Such support should be tightly targeted to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and aimed to achieve balance between the fishing capacity and the available fishing opportunities. 2. Contributing to food security in the Union through competitive and sustainable aquaculture and markets : the EMFF may support the promotion and the sustainable development of aquaculture, including freshwater aquaculture, for the farming of aquatic animals and plants for the production of food and other raw material. Public health actions, aquaculture stock insurance schemes and animal health and welfare actions shall also be eligible. 3. Enabling the growth of a sustainable blue economy and fostering prosperous coastal communities : the fund shall support community-led local development under shared management to stimulate economic diversification in a local context through the development of coastal and inland fisheries, aquaculture and a sustainable blue economy. It shall also support the collection, management and use of data to improve knowledge of the state of the marine environment. 4. Strengthening international ocean governance and enabling safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans : the EU plays a leading role in particular in preventing, deterring and eradicating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, improving the international framework for ocean governance, reducing pressures on oceans and seas, creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy and strengthening international ocean research and data. The EMFF shall support these international commitments and objectives under direct management. The EMFF shall also contribute to achieving the Union's environmental objectives in the light of the Commission's proposal to increase the total share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25%. Simplification : under the proposal, the EMFF beyond 2020 shall evolve towards a simplified architecture. Its effectiveness shall be improved by (i) allowing Member States to target support based on their strategic priorities; (ii) better targeting of support for the CFP; and (iii) better alignment with other EU funds since the rules applicable to all structural and investment funds are laid down in a Common Provisions Regulation. In concrete terms, the EMFF shall co-finance projects alongside national funding streams with each Member State receiving a share of the total budget. Member States would prepare their national operational programmes indicating how they intend to spend the funds. Once these programmes have been approved by the Commission, the national authorities would decide which projects they wish to finance. Proposed budget : the proposed overall budget for the EMFF amounts, in current prices, to EUR 6.14 billion, of which (i) EUR 5.31 billion allocated to support under shared management by the Member States through EMFF programmes based on national strategies and (ii) EUR 829 million to direct management. Concerning shared management, after having deducted the value of the UK programme (EUR 243 million), Member States would retain, in nominal terms, 96.5% of their 2014-2020 allocation. In order to ensure stability in particular with regard to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, the definition of national allocations will be based on the 2014-2020 shares."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU has long been worldwide leader in the development of renewable energy. The 2030 framework for climate and energy sets out the EU target of at least 27% for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030. If no new policies are put in place, EU energy system projections indicate that current Member States and EU policies would only lead to approximately, 24.3% of renewable energy consumption in 2030. This level would be well below the minimum 27% EU level binding renewable energy target. It would prevent the Union from collectively delivering on the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Accordingly, the Commission indicates that reaching the EU level target of at least 27% calls for a change in policies in the form of a Union level framework leading to EU, national and regional level measures. The European Parliament called upon the Commission to present the renewable energy legislation and to increase even further the ambition level to at least 30%. This proposal is linked to the proposals the recast of the Third Energy Package (please refer to 2016/0379(COD), 2016/0380(COD), and 2016/0378(COD)). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered it opportune to go ahead with a recasting proposal for the Renewable Energy Directive. In particular, it has opted for more proportionate and less burdensome provisions for the heating and cooling sector combined with strengthened provisions in the governance framework to safeguard the achievement of the 2030 targets. CONTENT : the proposed Directive identified six key areas for action: creating an enabling framework for further deployment of renewables in the electricity sector; mainstreaming renewables in the heating and cooling sector; decarbonising and diversifying the transport sector; empowering and informing consumers; strengthening the EU sustainability criteria for bioenergy; making sure the EU level binding target is achieved on time and in a cost effective way. The main provisions which substantially change Directive 2009/28/EC or add new elements are as follows: the proposal sets out the Union binding overall target for 2030: Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union's gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 27%. It establishes the 2020 national targets as baseline; it lays down the general principles that Member States may apply when designing cost-effective support schemes; the provision which regulates how to calculate the share of energy from renewable sources now includes a decreasing maximum share of biofuels and bioliquids produced from food or feed crops starting from 2021; the proposal includes a new calculation methodology (anchored on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive) of minimum levels of energy from renewable sources in new and existing buildings that are subject to renovation; it establishes a permit granting process for renewable energy projects with one designated authority (""one-stop-shop""); it includes some modifications to the guarantees of origin system; it empowers consumers by enabling them to self-consume without undue restrictions; Member States will endeavour to achieve an annual increase of 1% in the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling supply; the proposal establishes a EU-level obligation for fuel suppliers to provide a certain share (6.8% in 2030) of low-emission and renewable fuels, in order to stimulate decarbonisation; the draft regulation strengthens the existing EU sustainability criteria for bioenergy, by extending their scope to cover biomass and biogas for heating and cooling and electricity generation."

It provides for an application date of 1 January 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related public health crisis is placing a heavy burden on national authorities and organic operators. The pandemic has also created extraordinary circumstances that require considerable adaptation of the organic sector in terms of production, marketing, controls and international trade.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was set up in March 2004 for an initial period of five years by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 . Regulation (EC) No 1007/2008 extended ENISA’s mandate until March 2012. The extension of ENISA’s mandate in 2008 also launched a debate on the general direction of European efforts towards network and information security (NIS), to which the Commission contributed by launching a public consultation (which ran from November 2008 to January 2009 and gathered nearly 600 contributions). On 30 March 2009, the Commission adopted a Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) focusing on the protection of Europe from cyber attacks and cyber disruptions by enhancing preparedness, security and resilience, with an Action Plan calling on ENISA to play a role, mainly in support to Member States. The Action Plan was broadly endorsed in the discussion at the Ministerial Conference on CIIP held in Tallinn, Estonia, on 27 and 28 April 2009. The European Union Presidency’s Conference Conclusions stress the importance of the need torethink and reformulate the Agency’s mandate. ENISA was originally created with the main goal of ensuring a high and effective level of network and information security within the Union. However, given the experience gained with the Agency, as well as the current challenges and threats to network and information security (NIS), it is necessary to modernise its mandate to make it better fit the European Union’s needs. These stem from a variety of factors such as: the fragmentation of national approaches to tackling the evolving challenges; the lack of collaborative models in the implementation of NIS policies; the insufficient level of preparedness also due to the limited European early warning and response capability; the lack of reliable European data and limited knowledge about evolving problems; the low level of awareness of NIS risks and challenges; and the challenge of integrating NIS aspects in policies to fight cybercrime more effectively. This proposal for the recast of the ENISA Regulation therefore seeks to address these new challenges by revising the Agency’s mandate. It should be noted that another proposal has been issued in parallel which would extend the current mandate of the Agency until September 2013, the time it is estimated that will be required for the institutions to agree on the text of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: starting from the principle that keeping an Agency had been identified as an appropriate solution for attaining European policy objectives, five policy options were selected for further analysis: Option 2: carry on as before, i.e., with a similar mandate and the same level of resources; Option 3 : expand the tasks of ENISA, adding law enforcement and privacy protection authorities as fully fledged stakeholders; Option 4: add fighting cyber attacks and response to cyber incidents to its tasks; Option 5 : add supporting law enforcement and judicial authorities in fighting cybercrime to its tasks. Following a comparative cost-benefit analysis, option 3 was identified as the most cost-effective and efficient way of achieving the policy objectives because ENISA’s role would focus on: i) building and maintaining a liaison network between stakeholders and a knowledge network to ensure that ENISA is comprehensively informed of the European NIS landscape; ii) being the NIS support centre for policy development and policy implementation; iii) supporting the Union CIIP & Resilience policy; iv) setting up an Union framework for the collection of NIS data; v) studying the economics of NIS; vi) stimulating cooperation with third countries and international organisations; vii) performing non-operational tasks related to NIS aspects of cybercrime law enforcement and judicial cooperation. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to strengthen and modernise ENISA and to establish a new mandate for a period of five years. The proposal includes some key changes as compared to the original Regulation: Tasks of the Agency: ENISA’s tasks are updated and reformulated broadly, in order to provide more scope for Agency activities; they are sufficiently precise to depict the means by which the objectives are to be achieved. assist the Commission with policy development in the area of network and information security by providing it with advice by means of opinions and technical and socio-economic analyses, as well as undertaking preparatory work on the preparation and updating of EU legislation in this field; facilitate cooperation among the Member States and between the Member States and the Commission to prevent, detect, mitigate and respond to network and information security problems and incidents; assist the Member States and the European institutions and bodies in their efforts to collect, analyse and disseminate network and information security data; facilitate cooperation among the Member States’ competent public bodies, in particular supporting the development and exchange of good practices and standards; assist the Union and the Member States in promoting the use of risk management and security good practice and standards for electronic products, systems and services; encourage cooperation among public and private stakeholders and facilitate dialogue and exchanges of best practice at all levels in particular on aspects of the fight against cybercrime; assist the Commission on policy developments that take into account NIS aspects of the fight against cybercrime; carry out tasks conferred on the Agency by Union legislative acts. The Agency’s new mandate would permit: The European institutions and bodies could refer to it for assistance and advice which is in line with political and regulatory developments. Law enforcement and privacy protection authorities would become fully fledged stakeholders of the Agency, which would mean it would become a key interface in the fight against cybercrime. Management : on the organisational level, the main proposed changes relate to the following - strengthened governance structure . the proposal enhances the supervisory role of the Agency’s Management Board, in which the Member States and the Commission are represented. For example, the Management Board is able to issue general directions on staff matters (previously the sole responsibility of the Executive Director). It may also establish working bodies to assist it in carrying out its tasks, including monitoring the implementation of its decisions. - streamlining procedures: procedures that have proved to be unnecessarily burdensome are simplified. simplified procedure for Management Board internal rules; the opinion on the ENISA Work programme is provided by Commission services rather than via a Commission Decision. In addition, the Management Board is also given adequate resources in case it needs to take executive decisions and implement them (e.g., if a staff member lodges a complaint against the Executive Director or the Board itself). - gradual increase of resources : to meet the reinforced European priorities and the expanding challenges, without prejudice to the Commission's proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework, a gradual increase of the financial and human resources of the Agency are gradually to be increased between 2012 and 2016 is anticipated (see financial implication below). - option of extending the term of office of the Executive Director: the Management Board may extend the term of office of the Executive Director for three years. Review clause : the Regulation provides for an evaluation of the Agency, covering the period since the previous evaluation in 2007. Based on the findings, the Management Board will make recommendations to the Commission regarding changes to this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices. To enable the Commission to draft any proposal for an extension of the mandate in good time, the evaluation will have to be done by the end of the second year of the mandate provided by the Regulation. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: The proposal will impact on the Union budget. It is anticipated that the Agency will be given the resources required to carry out its activities satisfactorily. EU funding after 2013 will be examined in the context of a Commission-wide debate on all proposals for the post-2013 period. This means that once the Commission has made its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework, the Commission will present an amended legislative financial statement taking into account the conclusions of the impact assessment."

In the context of the alignment of Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council, implementing powers currently conferred upon the Commission by that Regulation should be provided for by conferring powers on the Commission to adopt delegated and/or implementing acts. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to amend Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 so as to align it to the new institutional context. In particular, the aim is to identify the powers conferred upon the Commission and put in place the appropriate procedure for adopting measures on the basis of these powers. It is proposed to: empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts when, for reasons of economic and technical changes, data requirements need to be updated, including submission deadlines and revisions, extensions and eliminations of data flows set out in Annex I, and when the definitions set out in Annex II need to be updated; confer implementing powers upon the Commission, in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, with a view to adopting common quality standards and harmonising the content and periodicity of the quality reports. The European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) shall assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers in certain statistical domains. These exclude the balance of payments, international trade in services and foreign direct investment. In these domains, according to Regulation (EC) No 184/2005, the Balance of Payments Committee (BOP Committee) assists the Commission. The Commission is proposing a new ESS structure to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, with the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, which is regarded as the umbrella committee within the ESS. Therefore, it is also proposed to amend Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 by replacing the references to the BOP committee by a reference to the ESSC."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is having a very negative impact on the economic and financial stability of the regions affected by enlargement and the neighbourhood policy. Most, if not all, enlargement and neighbourhood partners are set for a recession this year. Depending on the spread of the virus, as well as of its economic consequences, there is also a clear and imminent risk related to social stability and security, with possible spill-overs within the region and beyond. In these circumstances, the European Commission proposes to use Macro Financial Assistance (MFA) to support ten Neighbourhood countries in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. MFA is one of the instruments available to the EU to respond to external crises. It is used to address balance of payments crisis situations, in tandem with a disbursing International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangement that is subject to an agreed programme of economic reforms. The proposal is part of the ‘Team Europe’ strategy, which is the targeted response by which the EU intends to support its partners in their fight against the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to make available to partners a total of up to EUR 3 billion in medium and long-term loans to help cover their external financing needs in 2020 and 2021. Breakdown of the AMF Based on a preliminary assessment of financing needs, the amounts of MFA to be made available shall be distributed to the beneficiaries as follows:  Republic of Albania (EUR 180 million); Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUR 250 million); Georgia (EUR 150 million); Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (EUR 200 million); Kosovo (EUR 100 million); Republic of Moldova (EUR 100 million); Montenegro (EUR 60 million); Republic of Northern Macedonia (EUR 160 million); Republic of Tunisia (EUR 600 million); Ukraine (EUR 1.2 billion). The proposed MFA amounts would be made available to the beneficiary countries for 12 months in the form of loans granted on very favourable terms to help them meet their immediate and urgent financing needs. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2020. The second instalment could be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first half of 2021 provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. Objectives and conditions Combined with IMF support, this financing shall:  contribute to covering the external financing needs of the partner in the context of a significant deterioration of their external accounts brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis; alleviate the partner’s budgetary financing needs; support the fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of the foreseen IMF programme; support structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management, strengthening economic governance and transparency, and improving conditions for sustainable growth. The granting of the EU MFA shall be subject to:  the pre-condition that the partner respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights; satisfactory progress with the IMF programme and the continued drawing by the partner on IMF funds. The Commission shall report yearly to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year. Furthermore, the fulfilment of the objectives of the assistance shall be assessed not later than two years after the expiry of the availability period of the assistance. Budgetary implications The planned assistance shall be provided in the form of loans and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission shall conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance shall correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the Guarantee Fund for External Actions of the EU. The Commission considers that the budgetary impact of the proposed MFA operations can be accommodated within the Commission’s proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)."

Common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products""""",0.842,0.886,0.965,0.484,0.424,0.904,0.877,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to revise the objectives and instrument of the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a Common Market Organisation (CMO) for fisheries and aquaculture products has been in place since 1970. It is one of the pillars of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Its current legal basis is Regulation 104/2000, adopted in 1999. Since 2008, the Commission has been carrying out extensive evaluations and consultations to assess the performance of the current legal framework. Analyses led to identify five main problem areas found, which may be summarised as follows: (1) EU Common Market Organisation did not sufficiently contribute to sustainable production. (2) EU producers are facing limited or decreased production opportunities (fisheries and aquaculture). The production side is fragmented due to the number of species, landing and selling sites, whereas the demand side is strongly concentrated. EU production also lacks competitiveness in an increasingly globalised market. (3) EU producers to a large extent do not anticipate market demand in their production planning. This leads to a high volatility of first sale prices. (4) Potential is largely untapped. (5) The implementation of the Common Market Organisation is being held down by a cumbersome, overly complex framework. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy provides an excellent opportunity to review and possibly revise objectives and instruments of the Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: different policy alternatives options for the reform have been considered: continuing the current Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products; revising the current Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products by reducing intervention mechanisms to a single storage aid for fishery products destined for human consumption and making other instruments more simple, appropriate and flexible (marketing standards and information to consumers); enhancing the Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products by empowering Producers Organisations and Inter-Branch Organisations with new objectives and granting them financial support to draw and implement sustainable production and marketing plans; deregulating the current Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products. The Commission supports enhancing the Common Market Organisation so as to accompany the fisheries and aquaculture sector while it shifts toward sustainable production practices. The impact assessment concluded that, considering the new objectives and instruments of the CFP, a far-reaching reform of the Common Market Organisation was necessary: market-oriented instruments should contribute, directly or indirectly, to meeting the main CFP objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of the reform of the Common Fishery Policy is promoting the sustainable management of fishery resources through an economically viable sector, which in turn is to be increasingly empowered with its own management. In this context, the proposal for a reform of the Common Market Organisation focuses on the following objectives: Upgrading market incentives to support sustainable production practices : EU producers (fisheries and aquaculture) within Producers Organisations are on the coal face of production, day to day resource management and market issues. Their role, responsibility and mandate need to be reviewed in line with the objectives of the reform of the CFP in order to direct production activities towards sustainability. Other operators upstream in the sector should also be targeted so as to become more committed and responsible for sustainability of their sourcing. Improving the market position of EU production : addressing market imperfections, high information and transaction costs, as well as organisational matters, leads to focus on production activities (grouping supply and better marketing at first sale), increase competitiveness of EU production (quality, innovation and added value), reinforce bargaining power of producers and ensure level playing field conditions for all products marketed in the Union. Improving the connection between EU production and EU structural market changes and short term fluctuations should be better reflected in producers’ strategies : increasing transparency along the marketing chain of markets should facilitate supply meeting demand and enhance policy decision making. The volatility of first sale prices can be reduced by improving conditions for placing POs’ products on the market and by ensuring that production is planned and adjusted to demand in terms of quality, quantity and presentation. Enhancing the market potential of EU products : the comparative advantages of EU production (freshness, local, variety etc.) could be better exploited with more differentiation and merchandising. In addition EU consumers have the right to be informed with more precise and reliable information to reinforce confidence in fishery and aquaculture products. Supporting better governance, reduction of administrative burden and simplification of the legal framework : the existing provisions and instruments should be reviewed, simplified and clarified. The Common Market Organisation should be supported in the context of a new financial fund to be implemented within the reformed CFP. To address overfishing and unsustainable practices and move away from production strategies based solely on volume, the new Common Market Organisation will support: the empowerment of producers organisations and their co-management of access rights as well as production and marketing activities; market measures that increase the bargaining power of producers (in fisheries and aquaculture) improve prediction, prevention and management of market crisis and foster market transparency and efficiency; market incentives and premiums for sustainable practices; partnerships for sustainable production, sourcing and consumption; certification (ecolabels), promotion, information to consumers; additional market measures on discards. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: with a view to facilitating trade flows, Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 excludes the application of certain provisions of that Regulation to goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union while moving between two Union ports or airports without stopping outside the Union. Those provisions are the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration, the rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or an aircraft, the rules governing the obligation to convey the goods to certain places and to present them to the customs authorities at the point in which they are unloaded or transhipped, and the rules governing temporary storage. As a result, there is no legal basis for requiring the presentation of the goods that are unloaded or transhipped at the point where the goods re-enter the customs territory of the Union after having temporarily left it. Without presentation, it may be more difficult for customs authorities to ensure the supervision of those goods, and there is a risk both, that import duty and other charges are not correctly levied, and that non-fiscal measures such as veterinary and phytosanitary controls are not properly applied. CONTENT: the proposal aims to modify Article 136 UCC in order to ensure the effective application of other UCC provisions, notably those on customs supervision. Under the proposal, the only provisions not applying when non-Union goods re-enter the Union customs territory after having temporarily left it by direct sea or air route, should be: the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration (Articles 127 to 130 UCC) and (2) The rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or aircraft to the customs office of first entry to the Union customs territory (Article 133 UCC). by contrast, the provisions governing the obligation to convey the goods to a certain place, to present them to customs upon unloading or transhipment, to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping, and the provisions on temporary storage should apply in these situations, thereby allowing appropriate customs supervision. The situation should be similar for Union goods whose status needs to be proven pursuant to Article 153(2) UCC, to the extent that the customs authorities must be able to check the proof of their Union status. Lastly, the rules governing the obligation to present the goods to customs upon unloading or transhipment and the obligation to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping the goods should not apply to Union goods that have retained their status by virtue of the Regulation having regard to the fact that, even if the goods have temporarily left the Union customs territory, their status has not been altered and does not need to be proven. This amendment should enter into force as soon as possible so as to contribute to effective customs supervision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: during the fisheries consultations in 2010 between EU and Norway it was agreed to set up a Working Group to improve the control and enforcement measures in the fisheries in the Skagerrak, and to recommend ways to harmonise EU and Norwegian technical and control measures regulations in the area outside 4 nautical miles from the baselines. This Working Group on Technical Measures and Control in Skagerrak met during 2011 and reported in October 2011. In April 2012 the recommendations were included in the agreed record signed by EU and Norway. Against this background and in order to follow the objective of the CFP to ensure sustainable use of living aquatic resources and to eradicate discarding as unsustainable practice it is desirable to enact the recommendations listed in the Agreed Records in Union legislation. The provisions laid down in the present proposal are specific to the Skagerrak and the fisheries therein and hence do not form any precedent for the debate on the reform of the CFP. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the rules to be adopted will be applicable only in the Skagerrak, and are in the context of an EU-Norway international agreement. The EU-Norway agreement was based on the recommendations made by the technical Working Group, with stakeholder participation, that examined in detail the various options available in order to allow the continuation of the traditional fisheries in the Skagerrak following the expiry of the Skagerrak neighbourhood agreement. This Working Group is deemed to represent a sufficient alternative to the impact assessment. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENTS: the provisions of the proposal relate to changes to the technical measures in place in the Skagerrak in order to reduce the level of unwanted catches and discards where they negatively affect the sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources. The proposed changes aim, in particular: ·  to establish an obligation to land all catches of stocks subject to catch limits; ·  to introduce the obligation to land progressively; ·  to ensure that the handling of juvenile fish is limited to fish meal, pet food or other non-human consumption products, or for charitable purposes; ·  to improve the selectivity of the fishing gears by increasing the general minimum mesh size requirement for demersal fisheries but with derogations; ·  to restrict the use of fishing gears in the Skagerrak; ·  to establish certain measures to govern issues when on a given fishing trip fishing vessels combine their fishing activities in the Skagerrak with fishing in areas where the new technical measures adopted for the Skagerrak are not to be applied; ·  to adopt specific control measures in addition to those provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009; ·  to extend the use of prior notification as requested by Regulation (EC) 1224/2009 to cover all vessels with an overall length of 10 m or more and the prior notifications should be submitted two hours in advance to adapt to the fisheries; ·  to operate a Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) system on vessels operating in the Skagerrak; ·  to oblige Member States concerned to define a control and inspection measures for the Skagerrak and to incorporate these measures into their respective national control action programmes; ·  to provide rules for vessels transiting the Skagerrak in order to ensure that the new technical measures are respected. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions allowing the Commission the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: On 10 October 2007, the Commission published the Communication on an Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union (‘Blue Paper’), which was accompanied by an action plan which sets out a number of actions to be taken as a first step in implementing a newIMP. In October 2009, the Commission adopted a Progress Report on the EU’s which charted the course for its next implementation phase. In its conclusions of 16 November 2009, the General Affairs Council highlighted the importance of funding for the further development and implementation of the IMP by inviting the Commission to present the necessary proposals for the financing of integrated maritime policy actions within the existing Financial Perspective, with a view to entry into force by 2011. Further development and implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy along the lines set out by the Commission and endorsed by the Council is at risk because there are insufficient means to fund the necessary actions over the remaining period (2011 – 2013) of the current Financial Perspective. Pilot schemes and preparatory actions relating to the Integrated Maritime Policy can be financed only until the end of 2010. A continued modest financial underpinning is needed to enable the EU to implement and further develop the Integrated Maritime Policy in line with Parliament’s resolution of 20 May 2008 and to pursue the overarching objectives as set out in the Commission's Blue Paper, confirmed in the Progress Report and endorsed by the General Affairs Council conclusions of November 2009. This financing will enable the continuation of the exploratory work that has already been initiated through preparatory actions and pilot projects, and to further develop and concretise options for implementation of the IMP. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is not accompanied by an impact assessment. Nevertheless, the Commission conducted an ex-ante evaluation of the most detailed aspects of the proposed financing programme. The three policy alternatives identified in the ex-ante evaluation are the following: Option 2: a modest EU financial contribution, at a reasonably increased level compared to the preparatory and pilot projects so far, for further exploring options and steadily implementing the IMP as it develops; Taking into account the limitations of options 1 and 3 and the strong Community interest in achieving the IMP's objectives in the short to medium term, the appropriate solution would seem to be Option 2, i.e. a modest EU financial contribution to fund IMP activities for the period 2011-2013. LEGAL BASE: the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy has no explicit legal basis in the Treaty. However, it covers many EU sectoral policies with a bearing on the seas and coasts such as fisheries, freedom, security and justice, transport, industry, territorial cohesion, research, environment, energy, and tourism. That is why the proposed legislative act is based on Article 43(2), Article 74 and 77(2), Article 91(1) and 100(2), Article 173(3), Article 175, Article 188, Article 192(1), Article 194(2) and Article 195(2). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to establish a programme to support the further development of an Integrated Maritime Policy. The general objective of the proposed Programme is to provide adequate finances for further developing and implementing the Integrated Maritime Policy. This action follows on from preparatory actions and pilot projects to be launched from January 2011 till December 2013. The actions and activities financed by the proposed Programme will aim to help achieve the following objectives: further development and implementation of integrated maritime governance and integrated approaches within Member States and coastal regions; speedy and sound implementation of integrated sea basin strategies around Europe tailored to the needs of each maritime region; further development and implementation of cross-cutting tools for integrated policymaking including a European Marine Observation and Data Network, integrating maritime surveillance namely through the establishment of a Common Information Sharing Environment, Maritime Spatial Planning and Integrated Coastal Zone Management; further defining in the years the boundaries of sustainability of human activities that have an impact on the marine environment, in the framework of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive , paying due attention to their cumulative impacts on the basis of the ecosystem approach; promotion of the international dimension of the Integrated Maritime Policy by improving and fostering dialogue, cooperation and coordination with third countries, including those bordering a European sea basin, or actors in third countries, as well as with international partners and organisations on the Integrated Maritime Policy, ensuring coherence with the actions developed in the sectoral policies; putting renewed focus on sustainable economic growth, employment and innovation; raising the visibility of Maritime Europe, and promoting and facilitating the sharing of information, the exchange of best practices, the exploitation and reinforcement of synergies and dialogue with and among stakeholders on maritime governance and sectoral policies that have an impact on the oceans, seas and coasts, or the establishment of cross-sectoral cooperation platforms and networks at a horizontal and at sea-basin level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial envelope for implementing the Programme to support the further development of the Integrated Maritime Policy is set at EUR 50 000 000 and it will apply from 1 January 2011 until 31 December 2013."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: since 2004, the European Union has set out to improve the performance of air traffic management (ATM) in Europe by reforming the way air traffic is managed and organised and also by modernising and harmonising the European ATM infrastructure through the Single European Sky (SES) initiative. Sharing the common goal to develop safer and more efficient air transport, in 2011, the European Union and the United States of America signed the Memorandum of Cooperation between the United States of America and the European Union in civil aviation research and development (MoC). The cooperative activities carried out so far under the MoC mainly address ATM particularly cooperation in the field of research and development (R&D) between SESAR and NextGen programme managed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Cooperation under the MoC, in particular between SESAR and NextGen, has reached a high level of maturity and has delivered important results in terms of promoting global interoperability of ATM systems. This led the two parties to explore the potential for extending the scope of cooperation to topics relating to the deployment of ATM systems. On this basis, the Council authorised the Commission on 8 May 2017 to negotiate with the FAA concerning an amendment to the MoC to extend its scope to cover deployment. The Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation NAT-I-9406 between the United States of America and the European Union was signed on 13 December 2017, subject to its conclusion at a later date. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to authorise the entry into force of Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation NAT-I-9406 signed by the representatives of the Union and of the United States on the basis of a corresponding Council Decision. The Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation extends the scope of cooperation between the Parties to all phases of air traffic management modernisation, including deployment activities, with the goal of ensuring global interoperability and modifies the structure and governance of the Memorandum so as to optimise the implementation and management of the cooperative activities carried out thereunder. The research, development and validation activities related to the MoC will continue to be planned and monitored by the SESAR Joint Undertaking. The deployment activities will be planned and monitored by the SESAR Deployment Manager under the specific grant agreements signed with the Commission."
1130EP7,"""""Long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock""""",0.807,0.872,0.895,0.484,0.394,0.904,0.779,0.629,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a long-term plan for the conservation and management of the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock. PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in view of the Implementation Plan adopted at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development adopted at Johannesburg in 2002, the European Community is committed inter alia to maintain or restore fisheries stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield with the aim of achieving these goals for depleted stocks on an urgent basis and where possible not later than 2015. The anchovy fishery in Bay of Biscay has been closed since 2005 due to the poor state of that stock. In order to improve the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay, at a level that allows its sustainable exploitation in accordance with maximum sustainable yield, it is necessary to provide for measures for long-term management of the stock ensuring the exploitation of that stock at high yields consistent with maximum sustainable yield and guaranteeing, as far as possible, the stability of the fishery while maintaining a low risk of stock collapse. It stems from the advice provided by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) that harvesting a constant proportion of the spawning stock biomass would provide for sustainable stock management. The STECF also advises that the minimum spawning biomass level at which the stock could start to be harvested should be set at 24 000 tonnes and the precautionary biomass levels at 33 000 tonnes. Furthermore, the appropriate harvest rate should be 30% of the spawning stock biomass each year, subject to appropriate restrictions. This rate would minimize the risk of the stock falling below the minimum spawning biomass level, as well as the probability of a fishery closure, while keeping high yields. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered two main options, including three sub options: Option 1 : no policy change; Option 2 : long-term plan with 3 alternative sub-options Rule A: a strategy with relatively higher TAC levels but higher collapse risks; Rule B: a strategy with relatively lower TAC levels and lower collapse risks; Rule C: a strategy being a compromise between options A and B. Analysis indicated that a system based on a TAC set mid-year according to the June scientific advice, with a harvest rule establishing the annual TAC level automatically would be the preferred management option for the stock. The system would also include provisions on a closure when biomass is below a certain threshold. CONTENT: the objective of the plan shall be to maintain the biomass of the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay at a level that allows its sustainable exploitation in accordance with maximum sustainable yield, on the basis of scientific advice, and while ensuring as much stability and profitability for the fishing sector as is practicable. The main elements of the new plan are as follows: The need to set a long-term management plan instead of annual ad hoc measures to set fishing possibilities : the anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay is currently closed. In order to re-open the fishery, the Commission agrees with scientific advice and the views expressed by the stakeholders that this should only be done on the basis of a long-term strategy articulated around an appropriate harvesting rule. Proposal for an appropriate harvest control rule in order to guarantee the stability of the fishery : this long-term plan follows a harvest control rule that should ensure the exploitation of the anchovy at high yields, guarantee the stability of the fishery and have a low risk of stock collapse. Various options regarding possible rules assessed. On the basis of the results of the assessment, the proposal establishes an appropriate rule, according to which annual TACs (Total Allowable Catch) will be calculated. Strengthening control and enforcement : control provisions must also be incorporated into the long term plan. They should form the basis for a reinforced control regime and thus represent additional requirements to those laid down in the general control system of the Common Fisheries Policy, currently under review. Once the new Control Regulation is adopted, it should overrule the corresponding chapter in this Regulation. The proposal includes a provision providing for an evaluation of the plan each three years from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. The proposed plan sets a minimum spawning biomass level based on scientific advice from STECF and ICES, below which the fishery should remain closed. An evaluation clause is included in the proposal to ensure that this value can be amended, if appropriate in the light of new scientific information and advice. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

BACKGROUND: at present, the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation zone includes the European Union, the EFTA States, the participants in the Barcelona Process and the Faroe Islands. The pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin is made up of a multiplicity of agreements, setting out, among other things, free trade provisions based on a network of identical rules of origin allowing for diagonal cumulation, among the countries of the zone. This cumulation zone is bound to grow in the future. Since the implementation of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation, the difficulties with the management of the current system of individual protocols have increased. Any amendment to a protocol applicable between two partner countries of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone implies identical amendments to each and every protocol applicable within the zone. The European Commission therefore launched the idea of basing the diagonal cumulation of origin on a single legal instrument in the form of a regional convention on preferential rules of origin to which the individual free trade agreements applicable between the countries of the zone would refer. It was only in 2007 that Ministers agreed agreed to start the drafting of a single convention on preferential rules of origin for the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area in order to replace the current network of protocols on rules of origin. They also decided to include the participants in the Stabilisation and Association Process in this cumulation zone. On 26 November 2009, The Commission now calls on the Council to approve the Convention in the name of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(4) first subparagraph in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal relates to the conclusion of the regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin in the name of the EU. This Convention lays down the provisions regarding the origin of goods traded in the context of the relevant free-trade agreements concluded between the following Contracting Parties: the 27 Member States of the European Union, the EFTA States (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein), the Faroe Islands the participants in the Barcelona Process (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Palestine), the participants in the Stabilization and Association Process (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia , as well as Kosovo, under UNSC Resolution 1244/99). Main provisions: the Convention defines the concept of originating products ` and the methods of administrative cooperation to be applied between partners. These provisions are set out in the Appendixes to the Convention. The Convention also allows for: a more effective management of the system of pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation; an easier procedure for the amendment of rules of origin; existing provisions which are not commion to all future contracting parties to be catered for; the possible future extension of the geographical scope of cumulation to neighbouring countries and territories. Joint Committee: the Convention establishes a Joint Committee which will be empowered to amend its provisions and to decide of any future accession. The provisions of the Convention may be amended to take account of economic realities by the Joint Committee acting by unanimity. It should be noted that one of the stated objectives of the Convention is to move towards the application of identical rules of origin for the purpose of cumulation of origin for goods traded between all Contracting Parties. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in June 2005, the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Regulation entered into force on 30 July 2006. In response to calls from the European Parliament in 2010 and indications that medicines exported from the Union had been used for capital punishment in a third country, the lists of prohibited and controlled goods in Annexes II and III to that Regulation were amended by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1352/2011. The Commission also started a process to review Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 in its entirety, responding in particular to a Resolution of the European Parliament of 17 June 2010. In spring 2012, the Commission issued a call for applications with a view to establishing a Group of Experts to assist it with this review. During the period from July 2012 to July 2013, the Group of Experts met six times in Brussels with relevant Commission services. CONTENT: the main amendments that the Commission proposes to make to Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 focus on the following: Export controls targeting capital punishment : given these firm international commitments under either Protocol No 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights or, the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, exports to the States that are parties to one of them need not be subject to specific authorisation in order to prevent the relevant goods from being used for capital punishment and can be covered by a general export authorisation. According to the proposal, such authorisation should be subject to appropriate conditions to avoid the diversion of the goods to a country that has not abolished capital punishment without prior scrutiny by the competent authorities. The general authorisation should, therefore, only apply where the end-user of the exported goods is established in the country of destination and no re-export to another country takes place. If these conditions are not met, a request for a specific or global authorisation should be made to the competent authorities. Additional measures concerning listed goods : the proposal prohibits brokers in the Union from providing brokering services in relation to goods whose export and import are prohibited as such goods have no practical use other than for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Prohibiting the provision of such services serves the purpose of protecting public morals. Where controls on exports are applied, the provision of brokering services and the supply of technical assistance in relation to any of the listed goods should be prohibited, if the broker or supplier of technical assistance is aware that the relevant goods are or may be intended for capital punishment, when the controls are applied to prevent use for such punishment, or for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, when the controls are intended to prevent such use. Definition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment : the definition in Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 currently covers acts inflicting ‘significant pain or suffering’, whereas the definition of torture refers to ‘severe pain or suffering’. Instead of being based on different levels of pain or suffering, the distinction between these types of acts should take account of the presence or absence of an intention to inflict pain or suffering and of the use of pain or suffering for a purpose included in the definition of torture. The definition of ‘other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’, which is not found in the Convention, should be amended to align it with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. The Commission also considers it appropriate to clarify the meaning of the term ‘lawful penalties’ in the definitions of ‘torture’ and ‘other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’, taking into account this case-law and the Union’s policy on capital punishment. Exchange of information between customs authorities : the proposal requires customs authorities to share certain information with other customs authorities and, when they detect prohibited exports or imports of goods or exports of goods for which the required authorisation has not been granted, to inform the relevant authorities with a view to imposing penalties on the economic operator that committed the infringement. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the Schengen acquis, third-country nationals who are legally resident or staying in a Member State can move freely within the territory of the other Member States, provided they fulfil certain conditions. However, in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. Following the Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the technical work carried out in the Health Security Committee and the e-Health network, the Commission has put forward (in parallel with this proposal) a proposal for a Digital Green Certificate Regulation to establish an EU-wide framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework set out in the proposal for a Regulation on a digital green certificate applies to Union citizens or their family members who may be a third country national. This proposal has the objective of ensuring that the same framework applies to other third-country nationals who are legally staying or legally residing on the territory of an EU Member State and who are entitled to travel to another Member State in accordance with Union law. CONTENT: the proposal aims to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates of COVID-19 vaccination, testing and recovery. In concrete terms, the interoperable green digital certificate will prove that a person has been vaccinated against, tested negative for or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available free of charge, either electronically or paper format, and will include a QR code to ensure its security and authenticity. Member States should apply the rules set out in the future Regulation on a digital green certificate to third-country nationals who do not fall within the scope of that Regulation but who are legally resident or staying in their territory and are authorised to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. This proposal establishes neither an obligation nor a right to vaccination. Vaccination strategies are a national competence of the Member States. The proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The digital green certificate would thus be open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the unprecedented experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that the EU’s ability to coordinate work to ensure the availability of medicinal products and medical devices and facilitate their development is currently limited. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem of shortages for certain medicinal products considered as critical in addressing the pandemic, and has highlighted the structural limitations in the EU’s ability to rapidly and effectively react to such challenges during public health crises. The proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to reinforce the crisis preparedness and response and enhance the role of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Together, they form part of the EU’s overall health response to COVID-19 as well as an improved crisis management framework. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation should develop the core tasks already given to the EMA to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products with the potential to address public health emergencies. It would complement the measures directed at improving the overall EU crisis management framework by addressing the specific issues related to medicinal product and medical device sectors and the tasks of the Agency. It would thus introduce new rules for the Agency with the objective to provide mechanisms within the Agency to: monitor and mitigate the risk of shortages of critical medicines and medical devices; provide scientific advice on medicines which may have the potential to treat, prevent or diagnose the diseases causing those crises; coordinate studies to monitor the effectiveness and safety of vaccines; coordinate clinical trials. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications should relate mainly to administrative, scientific and IT support."

Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council""""",0.772,0.799,0.0,0.581,0.455,0.843,0.774,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress Microfinance Facility). PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the light of the unprecedented crisis that the European Union is currently facing, it is the citizens who risk paying the highest price in terms of unemployment. In order to prevent high levels of unemployment, boost job creation and pave the way for economic renewal, sustainable recovery and growth, the European Union decided to react by proposing a vast economic recovery plan. As part of this recovery plan, the Commission presented a Communication in which it proposed the creation of a new EU microfinance facility for employment (Progress Microfinance Facility) in order to give the unemployed the chance of a new start and to open the way to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including the young. That is the purpose of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not carry out a real impact assessment for this initiative but rather an ex-ante evaluation in which it notes that Community and national efforts have to be strengthened so as to increase the supply of micro-credits for those who need it most, i.e. unemployed or vulnerable people who want to go into self-employment but do not have access to bank credits. CONTENT: the proposed Facility shall provide Community resources with a view to facilitating access to microcredit for the following target groups: persons who have lost or are at risk of losing their job and want to start their own micro-enterprise, including self-employment; disadvantaged persons, including the young, who want to start or further develop their own micro-enterprise, including self-employment; micro-enterprises in the social economy which employ persons who have lost their job or which employ disadvantaged persons, including the young. Eligible actions : the Facility shall be implemented by using the following types of actions, as appropriate: guarantees and risk-sharing instruments; equity instruments; debt instruments; support measures, such as communication activities, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation which are directly necessary for the effective and efficient implementation of this Decision and for the achievement of its objectives (the total budget for these support measures shall not exceed 1% of the budget of the Facility). Beneficiaries : the Facility shall be open to public and private bodies established in the Member States which provide microfinance to persons and micro-enterprises in the Member States. Implementation : the Decision contains provisions on the management of the Facility. The Commission shall manage the Facility in accordance with the Financial Regulation. It shall conclude agreements with international financial institutions (EIB and EIF), which shall themselves conclude written agreements with the public and private providers of microfinance (whether banks or not) throughout the EU in order to finance initiatives that fall under the framework of the Facility. Evaluation, monitoring and reporting : the Facility is subject to traditional evaluation and anti-fraud provisions. From 2011, the Commission shall present to the European Parliament and to the Council a quantitative and qualitative annual report on the activities under this Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in line with the Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, the Facility is to be established by a reallocation of the existing budget. Under the terms of that agreement, the Parliament added an additional EUR 114 million to the budget for the Progress programme thus increasing the budget to EUR 743 250 000. This additional financing was to have been applied progressively in the later years of the programme i.e. from 2009. After examining all possible options, the funding would come from a reallocation of EUR 100 million (over 4 years) from the Progress Programme to the new European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (the Progress Microfinance Facility). This EUR 100 million from the existing budget could leverage more than EUR 500 million, in a joint initiative with international financial institutions, in particular the EIB Group."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, the European Union has granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process. Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 was codified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 of 30 November 2009. Two Stabilisation and Association Agreements, the first between the EC and their Member States of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and the second between the EC and its Member States of the one part, and Serbia of the other part, was signed respectively in Luxemburg on 16 June 2008 and on 29 April 2008. Pending the completion of the procedures necessary for its entry into force, two Interim Agreements on trade and trade-related matters were signed and concluded. These Agreements entered into force on 1 July 2008 (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and on 1 February 2010 (Serbia). The Stabilisation and Association Agreements and the Interim Agreements establish a contractual trade regime between the European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and between the European Union and Serbia. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 by removing Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia from the list of beneficiaries of the tariff concessions granted for the same products under the contractual regime and to adjust the global tariff quota volumes for specific products for which tariff quotas have been granted under the contractual regimes. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia should however remain beneficiaries of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 insofar as that Regulation provides for concessions which are more favourable than the concessions existing under the contractual regime. Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 expires on 31 December 2010. It remains the main instrument governing trade relations with Kosovo. The General Affairs Council in its Conclusions of 8 December 2009 states that in respect to the EU's relations with Kosovo it attaches importance to measures on trade, without prejudice to Member States' positions on status. Continued access to the market of the European Union is crucial for the economic recovery of Kosovo and the whole region. At the same time, it will not create negative effects for the European Union. The European Parliament in its Resolution on 26 November 2009 Enlargement strategy 2009 concerning the countries of the Western Balkans Iceland and Turkey calls on the Commission to make every possible effort to mitigate the effect of the economic crisis on the Western Balkans. For these reasons it is appropriate to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 to 31 December 2015. CONTENT: this proposal amends certain elements of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments consequent to the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In order to ensure the respect of the Union's international obligations, the preferences contained in this Regulation should be made conditional on continuation or renewal of the existing waiver from WTO obligations obtained by the European Union. To protect the economic interest of operators, it is necessary to provide for transitional measures for goods that are, at the date of entry into force of this Regulation in transit or in temporary storage in customs warehouses. Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 also contains certain powers reserved to the Council and which are not based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (comitology). The Commission will make a proposal which will revise all such procedures in the common commercial policy in the light of the system of implementing acts set out in Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the regulation on the rules and general principles concerning the Commission's exercise of the implementing powers adopted on the basis of Article 291(3). That proposal will also address Articles 2 and 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009. This proposal will be presented as soon as possible after the Commission has adopted a proposal on the rules and general principles concerning the Commission's exercise of the implementing powers. In order not to disrupt trade, it is necessary for this Regulation to be applied as of 1 January 2011 given that Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2009 expires on 31 December 2010. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EC budget. Its application would also not entail any losses of customs revenue compared to the current situation."

The Agreement was signed on 17 and 18 December 2009 and applies provisionally subject to its conclusion at a later date. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement by the Union and its Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) and the first subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

For details of the content of the Agreement, please refer to the summary of the previous initial legislative document dated 17/02/2009. Termination of the Agreement : procedural arrangements have been laid down in the Agreement for deciding, if appropriate, how to terminate the Agreement and a decision to withdraw such notice, shall be taken by the Council, on behalf of the Union and of the Member States, acting unanimously on the basis of a Commission proposal. Joint Committee : it also lays down appropriate procedural arrangements for the participation of the Union and the Member States in the Joint Committee set up under Article 17 of the Agreement and in the dispute settlement procedures provided for in Article 21 of the Agreement, as well as for implementing certain provisions of the Agreement concerning security and safety. It should be noted that as a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, the European Union has replaced and succeeded the European Community and from that date exercises all rights and assumes all obligations of the European Community. Therefore, references to ""the European Community"" in the text of the Agreement are, where appropriate, to be read as ""the European Union"".

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: a number of acts which were adopted over the last decades have exhausted all their effects, but remain technically into force. They have become obsolete because of their temporary character or because their content has been taken up by successive acts. Several measures linked to the accession of new Member States have become obsolete following their accession. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in their interinstitutional agreement on better law making that Union law should be updated and condensed by repealing acts which are no longer applied. Acts which have no continued relevance should be removed from the 'Union acquis', in order to improve transparency and certainty of Union law. The Commission identified two Council acts in the area of trade in goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products, which are based upon Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly art 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and before art 113 of the Treaty establishing the European Community), which have exhausted all practical effects, but are formally still in force. It is not within the Commission's powers to declare acts obsolete which were adopted by the Council. In the interest of legal certainty, the Commission suggests that the acts listed in this proposal shall be repealed by the Council. This proposal concerns: the repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) No 429/73 that determines the reduced fixed component of the import duties for processed agricultural products originating in Turkey. Its provisions became obsolete because Decision No 1/95 of the EC Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 on implementing the final phase of the Custom Union has eliminated Customs duties for goods originating in Turkey; the repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) No 215/2000 that renewed preferential tariff quotas only for the year 2000 and that has exhausted all its effects.

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND : Council Regulation (EC) No 55/20082 established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for Moldova, which gives all products originating in Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products listed in Annex I to that Regulation. For the latter, limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties. In June 2013, the EU finalised negotiations with Moldova on the Association Agreement, including the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA). In the framework of those negotiations, the Parties have proposed to fully liberalise the bilateral trade in wine. Moldova is currently experiencing difficulties with wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which threatens its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the Moldovan government. The agricultural sector represents around 40 % of Moldova's economy and the wine sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 300,000 people (one fourth of the working population), who mainly live in rural areas and cultivate medium to smaller family plots. The import of wine from Moldova into the Union should be liberalised without delay. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken CONTENT : the draft regulation proposes to fully liberalise import of wine from Moldova into the EU by amending Council Regulation (EC) 55/20081 and removing wine from Table 1 of Annex I. Accordingly, in the table in point 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 55/2008, the last row concerning order No 09.0514 ""Wine of fresh grapes other than sparkling wine"" will be deleted. It should be noted that the WTO waiver for the tariff preferences granted to Moldova does not cover the additional preferences for wine envisaged by the proposed regulation. Moreover, the waiver will expire on 31 December 2013. Accordingly, the EU should request pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the WTO Agreement the necessary extension and amendment of the scope of the existing waiver of its obligations under Article I and Article XIII of the GATT 1994 to the extent necessary to permit the EU to afford duty-free preferential treatment to wine originating in Moldova, without being required to extend the same duty-free treatment to like products of any other WTO Member. A Commission proposal to request the extension of the waiver is already pending before the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EU budget. As the general level of wine imports from Moldova is merely 0.6% of all EU wine imports further market opening is not expected to create negative effects for the EU."

BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between, firstly, the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts) and, secondly, the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In this context Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 needs to be aligned with the new rules of the TFEU.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by concessionnaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. Considering the special position of the Channel Fixed Link as a railway link involving a single, complex engineering structure situated partly in the territory of France and of a third country respectively, it is appropriate to authorise France to enter into an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link in order to maintain a unified safety regime in the whole Tunnel, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. To this end, a proposal for a Regulation amending Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety is also being presented in parallel by the Commission. CONTENT: following a request submitted by France on 16 July 2020, this proposal aims to authorise France to negotiate an international agreement supplementing the Treaty of Canterbury with the United Kingdom to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link by maintaining a single safety authority responsible for the whole infrastructure, and to define the specific requirements that the proposed agreement must meet, such as the obligation for the Intergovernmental Commission to apply EU rules on railway safety and interoperability. The Intergovernmental Commission established by the Treaty of Canterbury shall therefore remain the single safety authority and shall continue to apply Union rules on railway safety. The aim is to ensure that the Intergovernmental Commission applies Union law on the whole of the Channel Fixed Link, including in its section under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. In accordance with the Treaty of Canterbury, disputes between France and the United Kingdom concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaty of Canterbury shall be settled by an arbitration tribunal. Where such disputes raise questions relating to the interpretation of Union law, the arbitral tribunal should, in order to ensure the correct application of Union law, refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and defer to its decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council CONTENT: the EU has provided financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) from 1989. For the period 2005 to 2006 EUR 15 million was committed from the Community budget for each of the years 2005 and 2006 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 on Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland. That Regulation expired on 31 December 2006 and was replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 1968/2006 concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010). The regulation was adopted, like all previous regulations, on the basis of Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The European Parliament considered that the regulation should have been adopted under Article 159§3 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Article 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) and launched an action for annulment before the Court of Justice. The Court passed down its judgement on 3 September 2009 and ruled that both Articles 159§3 and 308 should be used as the legal basis and therefore annulled Council Regulation (EC) No 1968/2006 and asked the institutions to adopt a replacement regulation with a dual legal basis. In complying with the Court's ruling the European Commission is presenting a new proposal for a Regulation. In comparison with the annulled regulation the proposal for a new regulation reflects in the recitals the dual legal basis. All articles remain the same but Article 12 (on entry into force) provides for the retroactive application of Article 6 (on closure of the Fund) since in the annulled regulation the said article was providing for a closure strategy to be submitted to the Commission by June 2008. The closure strategy in question has indeed been submitted to the Commission and it has been approved. Legal Basis : Article 175 and Article 352 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal provides for EU contributions of EUR 15 million per year to the IFI for a period of 4 years from 2007 - 2010. The proposed new period will therefore end in 2010, which would coincide with the last year the Fund will be seeking financial contributions from the donors."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: money funds (MMF, money market funds) offer a short-term cash management tool that provides a high degree of liquidity, diversification, stability of value combined with a market-based yield. The majority of MMFs, around 80% of the assets and 60% of the funds, operate under the rules of the Directive 2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS). The rest of MMFs should been operating, since July 2013, under the rules of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) Directive 2011/61/EU. Events that occurred during the financial crisis have shed light on several features of MMFs that make them vulnerable when there are difficulties in financial markets and therefore may spread or amplify risks through the financial system. When the prices of the assets in which the MMFs are invested in start to decrease, especially during stressed market situations, the MMF cannot always maintain the promise to redeem immediately and to preserve the principal value of a unit or share issued by the MMF to investors. This situation may trigger massive and sudden redemption requests, potentially causing broader macroeconomic consequences. In order to preserve the integrity and stability of the internal market by promoting more resilient MMFs and limiting contagion channels, it is necessary to lay down rules regarding the operation of MMFs, in particular on the composition of the portfolio of MMFs. Uniform rules across the Union are necessary to ensure smooth operation of the short term funding market for financial institutions, corporate issuers of short term debt and governments. This proposal is in line with the Commission Green Paper (March 2012) on shadow banking. In response to the Green Paper, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on shadow banking in November 2012 where it invites the Commission to submit a proposal with particular focus on the MMF issue. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in order to ensure the liquidity and the stability of MMFs, a total of 16 options were analysed. The impacts including the costs and benefits on the various stakeholders, investors, asset managers, issuers of short term debt, sponsors were analysed. Such analysis concluded in favour of the creation of a more robust framework for MMFs, increased liquidity levels and more stable structure. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to create a regulatory framework for MMFs in view of ensuring an increased protection of investors in MMFs, as well as enhancing financial stability by preventing contagion risk. It also aims to ensure that the liquidity of the fund is adequate to face investor redemption requests and to render the structure of MMFs safe enough to withstand adverse market conditions. The more specific objectives of this initiative: (i) to prevent the risk of contagion to the real economy, (ii) to prevent the risk of contagion to the sponsor and, (iii) to reduce the disadvantages for late redeemers, especially with respect to redemptions in stressed market conditions. The proposal introduces uniform requirements that will deal, amongst others with the scope of eligible assets, with diversification rules, rules related to exposures to credit, interest rate and liquidity risks, as well as rules regarding the authorisation of the funds intending to engage in money market investment. These are essentially prudential product rules that aim to render the European MMFs more secure and efficient, mitigating hereto related systemic risk concerns. The taking up of activities as fund manager is regulated either by the UCITS Directive or by the AIFM Directive. The activities of the managers will continue to be subject to AIFMD and UCITS Directive but the product rules contained under UCITS framework will be supplemented by the product rules contained in this proposed Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation') ; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 42 and Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed rural development Regulation builds on the strategic approach introduced in the current period, which has had a positive impact with Member States developing strategies and programmes on the basis of a SWOT (s ) analysis to best tailor intervention to national and regional specificities. The new delivery mechanism aims at reinforcing the strategic approach – among other things by setting clearly defined common priorities for rural development at EU level (with associated common target indicators) as well as by making the necessary adjustments in light of experience gained to date. The proposed Regulation also includes the European Innovation Partnership on Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability which is aimed at promoting resource efficiency, building bridges between research and practice and generally encouraging innovation. The partnership acts through operational groups responsible for innovative projects and is supported by a network. In this context, rural development policy retains the long-term strategic objectives of contributing to the competitiveness of agriculture, the sustainable management of natural resources and climate action and the balanced territorial development of rural areas. In line with the Europe 2020 strategy, these broad objectives of rural development support for 2014-2020 are given more detailed expression through the following six EU-wide priorities: fostering knowledge transfer and innovation in agriculture, forestry and rural areas; enhancing competitiveness of all types of agriculture and enhancing farm viability; promoting food chain organization and risk management in agriculture; restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems dependent on agriculture and forestry; promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors; promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas. Within the overall framework of the CAP, support for rural development shall contribute to achieving the following objectives: the competitiveness of agriculture; the sustainable management of natural resources, and climate action; a balanced territorial development of rural areas. One should also note that the current cooperation measure is significantly reinforced and extended to support a wide range of types of cooperation (economic, environmental and social) between a wide range of potential beneficiaries. It now explicitly covers pilot projects as well as cooperation crossing regional and national borders. Leader and networking approaches will continue to play a key role, in particular for the development of rural areas and the spreading of innovation. Support through Leader will be consistent and coordinated with the support for local development from other EU shared management funds. A prize for local innovative co-operation projects will support transnational initiatives in favour of innovation. Lastly, a risk management toolkit including support to mutual funds and a new income stabilization tool offers new possibilities to deal with the strong volatility in agricultural markets that is expected to continue in the medium term. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on International Trade, the European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement. Some years ago when Switzerland was faced with a sharp increase in meat imports, including ‘seasoned meat’, the Swiss Parliament adopted a motion at the end of 2015 to reclassify certain ‘seasoned meat’, which led to a sharp increase in customs duties for the products in question. In 2017, the EU challenged this measure at the WTO, alleging its incompatibility with WTO rules. In April 2018, Switzerland agreed that it had to compensate for the increase of tariff and launched a negotiation procedure under Article XXVIII of the GATT in order to modify the tariff concessions in its schedule for the ‘meat not further prepared than seasoned’. At the end of 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate compensation. Switzerland proposed to increase its WTO tariff rate quota for beef by 1 200 tonnes as compensation. Within this tariff quota, Switzerland committed itself in particular to allocate a specific sub-quota of 600 tonnes for ‘seasoned meat’. A new tariff line has been created for this purpose. Switzerland also maintains the previously agreed reduced duty for beef imported for the purposes of processing into dry meat. A draft agreement was initialled in July 2019. On 24 October, the Council adopted a decision on the signing of the agreement, which was signed on 9 December 2019 in Brussels. By exchange of letters, the EU and Switzerland agreed on the amendments to be incorporated in the Swiss schedule of commitments: new tariffs (including for dry beef meat) and the increased tariff quota from 22 500 tonnes (current) to 23 700 tonnes."
8350EP8,"""""Visa Code""""",0.029,0.769,0.02,0.208,0.038,0.821,0.843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to reform the EU's common visa policy to adapt the rules to evolving security concerns, challenges linked to migration and new opportunities offered by technological developments. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Visa Code, which entered into force on 5 April 2010, is a core element of the common visa policy: it lays down harmonised procedures and conditions for processing visa applications and issuing visas. On the basis of an evaluation report on its implementation, the Commission adopted in April 2014 a proposal to recast the Visa Code with a view to improving travel to the EU through visa facilitation measures (thereby contributing to tourism and trade) and harmonising the implementation of common rules. However, the divergence between the positions of the European Parliament and the Council as well as the evolution of the migration situation and the increased threat to security observed in recent years have led the Commission to announce the withdrawal of its recast proposal. This proposal takes account of the outcome of the negotiations on the proposal to recast the Visa Code. While preserving security at the external borders and ensuring the smooth functioning of the Schengen area, the proposed amendments aim to facilitate the movement of bona fide travellers and to simplify the legal framework of the visa procedure. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is based on an impact assessment focusing on the three main issues: insufficient financial resources to support visa processing : the preferred option is a moderate increase of the common visa fee to EUR 80; repeated visa procedures for regular travellers : the preferred option is a ‘one-size-fits-all’ multiple entry visas cascade at EU level and the possibility of adapting the cascade to specific countries; insufficient levels of return of irregular migrants to some countries of origin : the preferred option is targeted negative incentives. Negative measures in the visa area are likely to be most effective in bringing change in third country governments towards cooperation with Member States on the readmission of irregular migrants, although they might need to be combined. CONTENT: this proposal amends Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code). It lays down the procedures and conditions for issuing visas for intended stays on the territory of Member States not exceeding 90 days in any 180-days period. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Practical modalities for lodging an application : the proposal extends to six months the maximum deadline for lodging an application to allow travellers to plan ahead and avoid peak seasons; due to their specific working conditions, seafarers may lodge their application nine months before the intended trip. Minimum deadline for lodging an application has been set to allow Member States time for proper assessment of applications and organisation of work. The proposal clarifies rules on who may lodge the application on behalf of the applicant and a reference is made to professional, cultural, sports or education association or institution as distinct from commercial intermediaries. Visa fee : the visa fee is increased from EUR 60 to EUR 80. The proposed increase of the fee will allow Member State to maintain adequate levels of consular staff to process visa applications. The visa fee for minors (6-12 years of age) will be increased by EUR 5 to EUR 40. Decision on the application : the general decision making time should be maximum 10 days. This delay may be extended to the maximum period for deciding on applications to 45 days in certain circumstances, when further review of the application is required. In case of visa refusal, procedures should ensure an effective judicial remedy. Multiple entry visas with longer validity : harmonised rules will apply to multiple entry visas to better prevent ‘visa shopping’ and to reduce costs and save time for Member States and frequent travellers. Such multiple entry visas will be issued to trusted regular travellers with a positive visa history for a gradually increasing period from 1 up to 5 years. Travellers' fulfilment of entry conditions will be thoroughly and repeatedly verified. Short-term visas at external borders : to facilitate short-term tourism, Member States will be allowed to issue single-entry visas directly at external land and sea borders under temporary, seasonal schemes subject to strict conditions. Detailed provisions establish safeguards to minimise the irregular migration and security risks. Such visas will be valid for a stay of a maximum of 7 days in the issuing Member State only. Cooperation on readmission : the general provisions on the limited number of supporting documents, the visa fee, fee waiver for holders of diplomatic passports, 10-day processing time and the issuing of multiple entry visas will not apply to nationals of third countries not cooperating on readmission on the basis of objective and relevant criteria. The Commission is regularly to assess third countries’ cooperation on readmission, taking account of a number of indicators. The Commission’s proposal for the reform of the Visa Information System legal framework (to be presented in spring 2018) will further enhance the security and efficiency of the visa procedure, in particular by taking account of technological developments."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (replacing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : this proposal follows the judgment of the European Court of Justice annulling Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union and maintaining the effects of the Regulation until a new regulation has been adopted on the appropriate legal basis. The Court's ruling of 6 September 2012 was decided after the European Parliament took legal action against the Council in October 2010 contesting the legal basis used for the adoption of Regulation 617/2010 and requesting the Court to annul it (Case C-490/10). The Council used Articles 337 TFEU and 187 of the Euratom Treaty as the legal bases, on the grounds that the Regulation relates to the activity of collecting general information. Following Parliament's request, the Court annulled Regulation 617/2010, but maintained its effects until a new regulation is adopted on the correct legal basis within a reasonable period of time Obtaining an overall picture of the development of investment in energy infrastructure in the Union is essential for the Commission to perform its tasks in the field of energy. In order to comply with the Court's judgement and to ensure continuity in the observation of investment projects in energy infrastructure, the Commission proposes a Regulation with the same content as the annulled Regulation and suggests a few adaptations, which are necessary due to the new legislative process. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given that an impact assessment was carried out when Regulation 617/2010 was proposed and that the content of the proposed regulation is the same as that of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010, the Commission did not carry out a new impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes a common framework for the notification to the Commission of data and information on investment projects in energy infrastructure in the petroleum, gas, electricity and bio-fuel sectors and related to carbon dioxide produced by these sectors. The scope of this proposed regulation is identical to that of the annulled Regulation . Member States are required to notify the Commission every two years of data and information on investment projects concerning production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas, electricity (including electricity from renewable sources), biofuels and the capture and storage of carbon dioxide. Investments to be notified to the Commission include : (i) projects both planned and under construction; (ii) transformation of existing infrastructure as well as (iii) decommissioning projects of a certain size, on a five-year horizon, in the territory of Member States, including interconnections with third countries. Undertakings concerned should be under an obligation to notify the Member State of the data and information in question. The only modifications concern the new legislative procedure (ordinary legislative procedure), the date for a review of the act (31 December 2016 instead of 23 July 2015) and the date for reporting. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will have a limited impact on the Community budget. Expenditure will cover information technology and, should the Commission so decide, purchasing of data and reimbursement of experts. There should be no direct impact on Member States’ budgets."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: Article 16 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Morocco, of the other part, which has been in force since 1 March 2000, provides that the Community and Morocco will gradually implement greater liberalisation of their reciprocal trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products. On 14 October 2005, the Council authorised the Commission to conduct negotiations within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Morocco, in view of the progress made by Morocco as regards the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan, adopted in July 2005, in order to achieve greater liberalisation of reciprocal trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process and in line with the principles of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the conclusions of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs (Luxembourg - May 2005). On 14 December 2009, the Commission concluded negotiations on behalf of the Union on an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with a view to amending the Association Agreement with Morocco, which now needs to be approved on behalf of the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: the first subparagraph of Article 207(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of the Exchange of Letters between the EU and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products, the replacement of Protocols 1, 2 and 3 and their Annexes and amendments to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Morocco, of the other part. The draft agreement is based on the conclusions of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on Agriculture in Venice of 27 November 2003 which provides that action should be taken with regard to the following areas: sanitary and phytosanitary measures, the approximation of technical standards, the harmonisation of legislation, and the protection of geographical indications. In order to implement the results of the negotiations concluded with Morocco, the Commission proposes to the Council that the following technical changes are made to the Association Agreement: the replacement of Protocols 1, 2 and 3 and their annexes, the repeal of Article 10, the amendment of the title of Chapter II, the amendment of Articles 7, 15 and 17 and the amendment of Article 18(1). The intention of both sides is that this Agreement should enter into force from 1 January 2011. Furthermore, to reinforce the existing cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary issues and issues relating to technical barriers to trade, specific provisions are added to Article 3 of Title II of the Protocol 1 of this Agreement. Regarding the protection of geographical indications and denominations of origin, the Parties have agreed to open negotiations no later than one year after the entry into force of this Agreement. The agreement also includes provisions to enable the EU to introduce safeguard measures in regard to the agricultural products, fish and fishery products, covered by the Association Agreement. The Council is requested to adopt the proposed decision after the approval of the European Parliament. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: Article 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""delegated acts"" (Article 290(3)). Under Article 291 of the TFEU, Member States adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""implementing acts"" (Article 291(4)). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact analysis since the proposal to align Council Regulations (EC) No 2008/97, (EC) No 779/98 and (EC) No 1506/98 with the TFEU is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he objective of the present proposal consists in aligning three Council Regulations in the field of imports of olive oil and other agricultural products from Turkey with those provisions of the TFEU. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred upon the Commission under those regulations need to be aligned. It is necessary to re-classify the powers conferred upon the Commission into delegated and implementing powers and to amend the regulations above. In order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 2008/97, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of the resulting adjustments necessary for that Regulation where the present conditions of the special arrangements provided for in the Association Agreement are amended, in particular as regards the amounts, or where a new agreement is concluded. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 2008/97, (EC) No 779/98 and (EC) No 1506/98, the relevant implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.

3257EP7,"""""European Year of Citizens (2013)""""",0.035,0.799,0.719,0.097,0.212,0.783,0.81,0.686,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish the European Year of Citizens (2013). PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2009, an estimated 11.9 million Union citizens were living in another Member State than their own and many more might exercise this right at some point in their lives: a Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2009 showed that more than one third (35%) of European citizens would consider working in another Member State. However, close to one in five Europeans see too many obstacles to working in another Member State. Lack of information is (together with language difficulties) is the most important barrier to cross-border commuting, which constitutes, besides trans-national migration, the main form of geographic labour mobility within the EU. Recent surveys have also shown that the information citizens need in order to exercise their right to free movement is not strictly limited to the conditions for using this right as such: amongst the administrative issues which people had looked at prior to moving to another Member State, the two items mentioned most often were social security and welfare and the recognition of academic diplomas. It is clear that citizens who wish to study, work, retire, live in another Member State need to be adequately informed about the different rights available to them in cross-border situations and to be able to effectively enjoy them in practice. Without this knowledge citizens are not able to make informed decisions about making use of their free movement rights. More broadly, citizens' awareness of their rights to free movement and more generally of their rights as Union citizens is crucial to enable individuals, businesses and society as a whole to benefit from the full range of opportunities available in the single market. The significant gaps in citizens' awareness of their rights were demonstrated by a 2010 Eurobarometer survey which showed that, although Europeans are broadly aware of their status as Union citizens (79% claim some familiarity with the term 'citizen of the European Union'), they lack concrete knowledge about the exact meaning of rights attached to this status. More specifically, only 43% know the meaning of the term 'citizen of the European Union' and almost half of European citizens (48%) indicate that they are not well informed about their rights. In the EU Citizenship Report 2010""Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens' rights"", the Commission identified main obstacles which citizens still encounter in their daily lives when they seek to exercise their rights as Union citizens and outlined 25 concrete actions to remove these obstacles. In the context of this exercise, the Commission concluded that Union citizens are prevented from enjoying their rights because they lack awareness of them and announced its intention to step up the dissemination of information to Union citizens about their rights as such and in particular about their free movement rights. The designation of 2013 as the European Year of Citizens, leading to the organisation of targeted events on EU citizenship and citizen-related EU policies during this year, is thus listed in the EU Citizenship Report 2010 as one of the actions to implement in order to remedy this lack of awareness. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an ex-ante evaluation was carried out, which indicated amongst other matters, that the actions to be implemented in the proposed European Year do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. The proposal respects therefore the principle of proportionality. LEGAL BASIS: Article 21(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). Although Member States retain the primary responsibility for raising citizens' awareness of their rights as Union citizens, adequate actions to address this problem require multilateral partnerships, transnational exchanges of information and experience and Union-wide awareness-raising and dissemination of good practices. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed European Year can be better achieved at Union level. CONTENT: the year 2013 shall be designated as the European Year of Citizens. The overall purpose of the proposed European Year of Citizens is to ensure that all Union citizens are aware of the rights available to them in a cross-border context by virtue of their Union citizenship status, so as to enable them to make informed decisions about whether to make use of their right to free movement and to facilitate the effective exercise of this right. The European Year will aim, more specifically, at: raising Union citizens' awareness of their right to move and reside freely within the European Union and more generally the rights guaranteed to Union citizens in cross-border situations, including their right to participate in the democratic life of the Union; raising Union citizens' awareness of how they can tangibly benefit from EU rights and policies while living in another Member State, and at stimulating their active participation in civic fora on Union policies and issues; stimulating a debate about the impact and potential of the right to free movement, as an inalienable aspect of Union citizenship, in particular in terms of strengthening societal cohesion and mutual understanding between Union citizens and the bond between citizens and the Union. Initiatives involved : the measures to be taken to achieve these objectives may include the following initiatives organised at Union, national, regional or local level linked to the objectives of the European Year: information, education and awareness raising campaigns targeted at the general public and more specific audiences; exchange of information, sharing of experience and good practices of national, regional, local administrations and other organisations; conferences and events to promote debate and raise awareness of the importance and benefits of the right to free movement and residence and more generally citizens' rights as Union citizens; use of the existing multilingual participatory tools to stimulate citizens' contributions in giving tangible effect to their rights and more generally in achieving the objectives of the European Year; strengthening of the role and visibility of the multilingual Europe Direct and Your Europe web portal as key elements of a 'one-stop-shop' information system on Union citizens' rights; strengthening of the role and visibility of problem solving tools, such as SOLVIT, to allow Union citizens to better make use of and defend their rights. Coordination at Union level : the Commission shall cooperate closely with Member States and bodies and associations which represent local and regional interests, in particular the Committee of Regions. It will also cooperate closely with the European Economic and Social Committee. It will convene meetings of representatives of European organisations or bodies active in the field of defending citizens' rights and stakeholders to assist the Commission in implementing the European Year at Union level. Evaluation :by 31 December 2014, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in the Decision. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: no additional funding is sought for the European Year. The flexibility for annual priority setting based on the budget lines and programmes of the Directorate General for Communication provides sufficient financial margin for running the Year on a EUR 1 million scale."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. At the end of the transition period, and in the absence of any special provision, all rights and obligations ensuing from Union law in respect of market access would be ended, insofar as the relationship between the United Kingdom and the Union and its Member States is concerned. In such a situation, the international transport of goods and passengers by road between the Union and the United Kingdom would be severely disrupted. PURPOSE: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down temporary measures to govern the carriage of goods by road as well as the provision of regular and special regular passenger transport services between, on the one side, the Union and, on the other side, the United Kingdom following the end of the transition period referred to in the withdrawal agreement. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a strictly time-limited period of 6 months (until 30 June 2021) provided that the UK provides the same guarantees to EU carriers. The proposal provides for: - the unilateral granting of rights for bilateral carriage to road haulage operators established in United Kingdom so that they can continue to carry goods between their territory and the Union; - the unilateral granting of rights for the bilateral carriage of passengers by coach and bus as part of regular or special regular services to bus and coach operators established in the United Kingdom so that they can continue to carry passengers between their territory and the Union; - the unilateral granting of rights to pick up and set down passengers in the border region of Ireland in the course of international regular and special regular services between Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland. In addition, the proposal: - makes rights granted to United Kingdom road operators subject to conformity with the relevant Union law applicable to road freight and road passenger transport operators and equivalent rights being granted by the United Kingdom to Union road operators; - lays down a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by EU road operators in the United Kingdom are equivalent to those granted to United Kingdom road operators under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of delegated acts; - lays down a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union road haulage operators and coach and bus service operators enjoy fair and equal opportunities to compete with United Kingdom road haulage operators and coach and bus service operators."

A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013 ; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers. The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in view of the application of the direct payments regulation as from 1 January 2014, this regulation sets net ceilings for direct payments for the calendar year 2013 by establishing an adjustment mechanism similar to modulation so as to ensure continuity in payment levels while taking into account the phasing in of new Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2018/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a new regulatory framework as regards organic production. It provides for an application date of 1 January 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related public health crisis is placing a heavy burden on national authorities and organic operators. The pandemic has also created extraordinary circumstances that require considerable adaptation of the organic sector in terms of production, marketing, controls and international trade. Due to these extraordinary circumstances, it is very likely that Member States and organic operators will not be ready to ensure the proper implementation and application of Regulation (EU) 2018/848 from 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market, to provide legal certainty to all organic operators, and to avoid potential market disruption, the Commission proposes to defer the date of application of certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/848 by one year (until 1 January 2022) and certain other dates referred to in that Regulation that are derived from that date. The proposed amendments aim to ensure that the intended purpose of Regulation (EU) 2018/848, that is to achieve: - the establishment of a framework for organic production, with the goal of developing further an overall system of farm management and food production that combines best environmental and climate action practices; - a high level of biodiversity; - the preservation of natural resources and the application of high animal welfare standards and high production standards in line with the demand of a growing number of consumers for products using natural substances and processes."
2195EP7,"""""Implementation of Article 10 of the United Nations Firearms Protocol and establishing export authorisation, import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition""""",0.86,0.872,0.807,0.677,0.485,0.771,0.831,0.8,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: lays down rules governing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, for the purpose of implementing Article 10 of the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: In accordance with Council Decision 2001/748/EC concerning the signing on behalf of the European Community12 of the United Nations Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against transnational Organised Crime, the Commission signed that Protocol on behalf of the Community on 16 January 2002. The UN Firearms Protocol - the purpose of which is promote, facilitate and strengthen cooperation among States Parties in order to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition - entered into force on 3 July 2005. This proposal aims to complete the process of transposition into Union legislation of the provisions of the Protocol. It is also included in the broader framework of the Stockholm Programme for ‘an open and secure Europe, serving and protecting citizens’ highlights trafficking in arms as one of the illegal activities that continue to challenge the internal security of the EU and reaffirms that the Union should continue to promote ratification of international Conventions (and their Protocols), in particular those developed under the auspices of the United Nations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal developed four policy options: Policy option 1 : refrain from taking EU action. This was identified as a theoretical option due both to the legal international obligation entered into by the Community (now Union) by means of signature of the Protocol and to the lack of uniform principles in a matter falling under the common commercial policy, an exclusive competence of the Union; Policy option 2 : this option aimed at optimal achievement of the objective of contributing to the improvement of security with regard to export, import and transit of firearms for civilian use and prevention of possible diversion from the legal market; Policy option 3 : this option aimed to achieve efficient implementation of Article 10 of the UNFP for private parties; Policy option 4 : this option focused on efficiency for national administrations. Option 3 was the preferred one and is reflected in this proposal . It fulfils the objectives of implementing Article 10 UNFP in the most comprehensive manner and is the best way forward by combining the ‘shall’ (i.e. mandatory) provisions — adapted to the type of products (for civilian use) — with the ‘may’ (i.e. optional) ones, which would match stakeholders’ legitimate expectations. It combines different aspects of the various policy options on the basis of the main advantages and disadvantages identified for each one of them, in order to achieve a higher degree of both effectiveness and efficiency. The envisaged simplified procedure for temporary exports for ‘verifiable lawful purposes’ and in particular the proposed transit measures will reduce the possible administrative burdens for those lawful purposes listed by the UNFP itself. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (Common Commercial Policy which is an exclusive competence of the Union according to Article 3 TFEU, within which Article 10 UNFP provisions fall). The proposal applies only to firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition for civilian use and not to firearms that are intended specifically for military purposes. Pursuant to Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the common commercial policy should be based on uniform principles, inter alia as regards exports. CONTENT: Article 10 of the UNFP on ‘general requirements for export, import and transit licensing or authorisation systems’ requires ‘each State Party to establish or maintain an effective system of export and import licensing or authorisation, as well as of measures on international transit, for the transfer of firearms, their parts and components and ammunition’, thereby improving scrutiny of transfers and allowing better enforcement of laws. Principles : Article 10 UNFP is based on the principle that firearms and related items should not be transferred between States without the awareness and consent of all States involved. Firearms should not be exported to or through countries that have not authorised the transfer. The content of the documents used for legal export and import should be sufficient to ensure tracing. Besides the above-mentioned ‘Shall’ provisions, Article 10 UNFP also allows the Parties to adopt simplified procedures for temporary export, import and transit of small numbers of firearms for ‘verifiable lawful purposes’, such as recreational, repair, exhibition. The latter are referred to as ‘May’ provisions. In application of Article 10 of the Protocol, the proposal is structured as follows : Subject, definition and scope : this proposal only addresses trade in/transfers of firearms to third countries and consequently does not concern intra-Community transfers of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition. Definitions (Article 2) take into account — where appropriate — the parallel provisions of the UN Firearms Protocol, but are tailored to or directly invoke other existing EU legislation, for the sake of clarity: for example, the definitions of firearms, parts and essential components and ammunition mirror those of Directive 91/477 or direct reference is made to the Community Customs Code. Article 3 lists the specific exceptions to which the Regulation does not apply. Export authorisation, procedures and controls : the relevant articles transpose the concepts mandatorily established by Article 10 UNFP. Article 4 establishes the general obligation for requiring export authorisation, refers to the list of products to which the proposal applies (in Annex to the proposal) and provides for updates. Articles 5 and 6 on the conditions for issuing the export authorisation also include some of the mitigation measures resulting from the advice received from stakeholders during the consultation, for example: maximum processing period (90 working days), possible use of electronic documents and tacit consent for transit. Articles 11 and 12 address respectively the correspondent provisions of Article 10(4) and (5) UNFP on verification of the authorisation procedure. Simplified procedures : this proposal in particular takes into account the need for simplified measures for temporary exports for verifiable lawful purposes, implementing the nonbinding provision of Article 10(6) UNFP. Simplified procedures should be limited to hunters and sport shooters only (while the UNFP includes consideration also for other activities such as exhibitions or repairs). Criteria applicable to export authorisation, procedures and controls : this chapter also includes provisions on general criteria to be taken into account by Member States when assessing a request for export authorisation (Articles 8 and 9) and on powers of national competent authorities (Article 13), which are similar to those laid down in other commercial policy legislation, namely the ‘Dual Use’ Regulation10. Article 10 focuses on the need for record-keeping. Article 14 reproduces a standard formula on penalties. Customs procedures and administrative cooperation : Chapter III, on ‘customs procedures’ (Articles 15 and 16), and Chapter IV on ‘administrative cooperation’ (Article 17), include standard provisions commonly used in a commercial policy instrument. General and final provisions : besides the establishment of a Coordination Group (Article 18), it includes in particular a review clause (Article 19(3)), and provisions on the entry into force of the Regulation (Article 20). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: even if mobility within the European Union of qualified professionals, a Eurobarometer poll in 2010 shows that 28% of EU citizens are considering working abroad. In this context, the recognition of professional qualifications is essential to ensure that European citizens may genuinely benefit from the fundamental freedoms of the internal market and respond to the needs of Member States facing increasing shortages of skilled workers, in particular in sectors such as health, education, construction or business services. The Communication on the Single Market Act identified the recognition of professional qualifications as a major issue. It underlined the need for the modernisation of the existing framework. On 23 October 2011, the European Council invited the Institutions to undertake their utmost to reach a political agreement by the end of 2012 on the 12 initiatives in the Single Market Act, including on a Commission proposal for modernising Directive 2005/36/EC. The European Parliament also called for urgent action in its report dated 15 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment on various policy alternatives. This analysis identified eight groups of problems, deriving mainly from the outcome of the evaluation and from the reactions to the Green Paper. These groups of problems cover: the access to information on recognition procedures, the efficiency of recognition procedures, the functioning of the automatic recognition system, the conditions applying to establishment and those applying to temporary mobility and the scope of the Directive. Since public health emerged as a particular issue during the evaluation, the protection of patients has also been mentioned in the problem definition. The analysis identified three general objectives: facilitating the mobility of professionals and the intra-EU trade in services, addressing the challenge of filling high-skill jobs and offering more possibilities for job seekers. A wide range of options were examined for each group of problems. The main conclusions of the impact assessment relating to each group of problems addressed are published in parallel with this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 46, 53(1), Article 62 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is not proposing a new Directive but a well-targeted modernisation of the existing provisions. The main proposed changes relate to: - The creation of a European Professional Card: to reduce the complexity of procedures, it is proposed to create a European Professional Card (EPC). The EPC will be an alternative tool which can be implemented for those professions which meet several objectives: bottom-up demand by members of the profession, significant mobility and better cooperation between competent authorities through IMI. The EPC also offers potential for those professions interested mainly in temporary mobility. The introduction of the EPC will depend on whether professions request its introduction. The EPC aims to facilitate and accelerate the recognition procedure while at the same time making it more transparent. Therefore, the card requires more involvement by the home Member State, which implies the shift of certain costs and administrative burdens from the host Member State to the home Member State. The use of the Internal Market System becomes compulsory under the Directiv e. Since the successive extensions of IMI to cover all recognition mechanisms under the Directive, a significant number of competent authorities use IMI regularly with good results. Therefore, the proposal obliges Member States to use IMI for the exchange of information relating to recognition of professional qualifications. The use of IMI should reduce costs. The proposal lays down in detail the framework and the rules applicable to the issue of an EPC. The EPC’s advantages include reduced deadlines for the treatment of an application on the basis of the European professional card compared to the current procedure which will continue to exist for professionals preferring not to use the EPC. - Reforming the general rules for establishing in another Member State or moving on a temporary basis: a special regime for the free provision of services on a temporary basis was introduced through Directive 2005/36/EC. It foresees lighter rules for temporary service providers: they can provide services without the prior check of professional qualifications (except for professions with health and safety implications). Several amendments are proposed in this context. By removing the professional experience requirement imposed on service providers from non-regulating Member States when the service provider accompanies the service recipient, the proposal seeks to better cater to the needs of consumers crossing borders. Where the requirement of professional experience still applies, the proposal foresees that it can be acquired in one or several Member States which creates more opportunities for the services providers compared to the current situation. For professions with health and safety implications, Member States implemented the prior check of qualifications in diverse ways which has led to legal uncertainty for service providers. The proposal addresses this issue by requiring Member States not only to provide a list of all professions they consider as belonging to this category but also to justify their reasons for the inclusion of each profession. The proposal also clarifies the list of documents a Member State may require prior to the first provision of services. Two additional changes are proposed: general system : the revision concerns the existing possibility to exclude on the basis of Article 11 certain qualifications from the scope of the Directive when there are two ore more levels of difference between the professionals' training and the requirements in the host Member State. The qualification levels should, in principle, be used only as a benchmarking tool and not as a basis for excluding professionals from the scope of the Directive. The only exception relates to persons whose qualifications are based on professional experience who are seeking access to a profession requiring a university degree; partial access : it is also proposed to introduce the concept of partial access into the Directive. This will bring more legal certainty for professionals and will allow professionals fulfilling the conditions for partial access to establish themselves or to provide services where they were previously excluded from the benefits of the Directive. However, Member States may not apply this principle where there are overriding reasons such as in the case of health professions. - Modernising the system of automatic recognition: the proposed change in this field aims at introducing more flexibility for the Commission to adapt the list of activities contained in Annex IV of this Directive. This list no longer reflects the current structure of economic activities. As regards automatic recognition based on minimum training requirements, in order to improve transparency at EU level, the proposal requires each Member State to notify the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions related to the issuing of new or changed qualifications. Member States will also be obliged to involve an appropriate existing authority or body, such as an accreditation board or a ministry, to report about the compliance of the qualification with the Directive's minimum training requirements. The proposal also includes: new provisions to enhance the mobility of doctors (in particular specialists), nurses, architects and pharmacists; a series of common training principles : a common training framework or common training tests. These aim at introducing more automaticity in the recognition of qualifications currently covered by the general system and should better respond to the needs of the professions. The qualifications obtained under this regime should be automatically recognised in the Member States which might however benefit from derogations in applying them. In addition, the conditions for setting up common training principles are less difficult to fulfil than the conditions for setting up common platforms. - Offering a legal framework in the Directive for partially qualified professionals and for notaries: the proposal extends the scope of the Directive to professionals who hold a diploma but have yet to complete a remunerated traineeship which might be required under the law of the Member State where they graduated (this can apply, for example, to lawyers, architects and teachers). Furthermore, in response to a Court of Justice decision that nationality requirements cannot be imposed on notaries, the scope of the directive needs therefore to be clarified. Considering the specificities of the profession, the rules on establishment and free provision of services have to be well tailored. - Clarifying safeguards for patients: the checking of language knowledge is to take place only after the host Member State has recognised the qualification. In the case of health professionals, it also specifies that it is up to the national health care systems and patient organizations to check whether competent authorities should carry out language controls where strictly necessary; national competent authorities are obliged to alert each other in case a health professional benefiting from automatic recognition under the Directive is prohibited, even temporarily, to practice the profession. - Access to information on rules applicable to recognition of qualifications: to allow an easy identification of the competent authority and the required documents for a recognition request, the proposal foresees that the points of single contact, created under the Services Directive, become central online access points for all professions covered by the Professional Qualifications Directive. Therefore, the scope of the points of single contact is extended to categories of professionals not covered by the Services Directive (health professionals and job seekers). - Launching a systematic screening and mutual evaluation exercise for all regulated professions in the Member States: lastly, the proposal provides for the introduction of an obligation for Member States to notify a list of professions they regulate and to assess their legislation on the access to regulated professions against the principles of necessity (public interest), proportionality and non-discrimination. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal is expected to have implications for the EU budget to the extent that the future EPC will use the IMI System as its operational backbone. The IMI will have to be adapted to the EPC processes and storage requirements and supplemented with some additional functions, namely a specific interface, an alert mechanism and a declaration mechanism. The implications for the EU budget are already covered by planned allocations and will however be modest in view of the fact that using the IMI to underpin the EPC will provide important economies of scale and scope. The adaptation and development costs will therefore be substantially reduced."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: as a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the powers conferred upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the TFEU. The Commission has committed itself, with regard to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers16, to reviewing legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny in the light of the criteria laid down in the Treaty. The overall objective is by the end of Parliament's seventh term (June 2014), to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to modify nine legislative acts in the domain of agricultural and fishery statistics in order to align them with the new institutional context. In particular, the aim is to identify what powers the Commission has and establish the appropriate procedure for adopting measures on the basis of these powers. Another aspect of the proposal is the streamlining of the European Statistical System (ESS). It is recalled that the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC), established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, is regarded as the umbrella committee within the ESS. It assists the Commission in exercising of its implementing powers in certain statistical domains. These exclude agricultural and fishery statistics where the Commission is assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics (SCAS) . The Commission is proposing a new ESS structure aimed at improving coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, with the ESSC as highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. The suggestion is therefore to modify the nine legislative acts in order to replace the reference to the SCAS by a reference to the ESSC. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
6178EP7,"""""Assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment""""",0.772,0.817,0.07,0.516,0.394,0.831,0.785,0.171,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure a high level of protection of the environment and human health through establishing common minimum requirements on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (EIA). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2011/92/EU (which codifies Directive 85/337/EEC and its three subsequent amendments) contains a legal requirement to carry out an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of public or private projects likely to have significant effects on the environment, prior to their authorisation. The Directive has become a key instrument of environmental integration and has also brought environmental and socio-economic benefits. The mid-term review of the 6th Environment Action Programme and the latest Commission report published in 2009 on the application and efficacy of the EIA Directive (Directive 85/337/EEC) stressed the need for improving the assessment of environmental impacts and to adapt the Directive to the policy, legal and technical context which has evolved considerably. The general objective of the proposal is to adjust the provisions of the codified EIA Directive (Directive 2011/92/EU), so as to correct shortcomings, reflect ongoing environmental and socio-economic changes and challenges, and align with the principles of smart regulation. The revision of the EIA Directive subscribes to the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular the priority of sustainable growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment, which is submitted with the proposal, identified shortcomings in the current EIA legislation that lead to unsatisfactory implementation and socio-economic costs in the implementation of the Directive. The shortcomings of the Directive can be grouped into three specific problem areas: (1) the screening procedure, (2) the quality and analysis of the EIA and (3) the risks of inconsistencies within the EIA process itself and in relation to other legislation. The IA assessed a number of policy options with the aim of identifying cost-effective measures to address these problems. Nine of the twelve amendments analysed are expected to provide significant environmental and socio-economic benefits without additional administrative costs; moderate savings are also expected. · Two amendments (assessment of alternatives and monitoring) are expected to provide high environmental and socio-economic benefits at moderate costs for developers and with limited or negligible costs for public authorities. · One amendment (adaptation of the EIA to new challenges) is expected to provide high benefits at moderate to high costs for developers and public authorities. In the long term, the significant environmental and socio-economic benefits and the moderate savings associated with the proposed amendments are likely to exceed the administrative costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal for the amendment of Directive 2011/92/EU aims to : (i) strengthen the provisions concerning the quality of the EIA with the aim of achieving a high level of environmental protection; (ii) enhance policy coherence and synergies with other EU law instruments and (iii) simplify procedures, with a view to reducing unnecessary administrative burdens. The main amendments are as follows: · Initial screening: it is proposed to clarify the screening procedure, by modifying the criteria of Annex III and specifying the content and justification of screening decisions. These amendments would ensure that EIAs are carried out only for projects that would have significant environmental effects, avoiding unnecessary administrative burden for small-scale projects. · Quality and analysis of the EIA : it is proposed to: (i) introduce amendments to reinforce the quality of the process (i.e. mandatory scoping and quality control of EIA information), (ii) specify the content of the EIA report (mandatory assessment of reasonable alternatives, justification of final decisions, mandatory post-EIA monitoring of significant adverse effects) and (iii) adapt the EIA to challenges (i.e. biodiversity, climate change, disaster risks, availability of natural resources). · Risk of inconsistencies : it is proposed to: (i) specify the time-frames for the main stages required by the Directive (public consultation, screening decision, final EIA decision) and (ii) introduce a mechanism, a kind of EIA one-stop shop to ensure coordination or joint operation of the EIA with the environmental assessments required under other relevant EU legislation, e.g. Directives 2010/75/EU, 92/43/EEC, 2001/42/EC.

BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: powers which may be delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a particular legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the implementing powers which shall be conferred on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed, as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers, the Commission has committed itself to reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU, legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (previously known as “comitology”). The overall objective is to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments by the end of Parliament’s seventh term (June 2014). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 in order to align it with the new institutional context. It is proposed to: empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adaptation of the list of customs procedures or provisions deriving from international conventions, changes necessary for methodological reasons and the necessity to set up an efficient system for the collection of data and the compilation of statistics; confer implementing powers on the Commission enabling it to adopt measures relating to the codes to be used for data referred to in Article 5(1) and also measures relating to the linking of the data on business characteristics with data recorded in accordance with the same Article. The Commission is also proposing to restructure the European Statistical System (ESS) to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure, with the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. In February 2012, the ESSC supported this new approach. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union’s General Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: crowdfunding has emerged as an established practice of funding a project or a venture, typically by a large number of people or organisations, through online platforms on which citizens, organisations and businesses, including business start-ups, raise relatively small amounts of money. Crowdfunding can thus provide an alternative to unsecured bank lending, which are currently the main sources of external finance for SMEs. The provision of crowdfunding services generally relies on three types of actors: the project owner that proposes the project to be funded, investors who fund the proposed project, generally by limited investments, and an intermediating organisation in the form of a service provider that brings together project owners and investors through an online platform. Several Member States have already introduced domestic bespoke regimes on crowdfunding. Those regimes are tailored to the characteristics and needs of local markets and investors. As a result, the national rules diverge as regards the conditions of operation of crowdfunding platforms, the scope of permitted activities and the licencing requirements. The differences between the existing national rules are such as to obstruct the cross border provision of crowdfunding services. It is therefore necessary to address the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market in crowdfunding services. This initiative is part of the Commission's priority of establishing a Capital Market Union (CMU), which aims to broaden access to finance for innovative companies, start-ups and other unlisted firms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that EU crowdfunding markets for business finance are largely underdeveloped compared to other major economies but - and most importantly - unable to properly operate cross-border. Amongst the options studied, the preferred option consists of introducing an EU-label for crowdfunding service providers, which would be authorised and supervised at EU level under an EU regime. CONTENT: the Commission’s proposal introduces an optional EU scheme that allows crowdfunding platforms to easily deliver their services across the EU single market. It establishes a one-stop-shop access to the EU market and therefore helps crowdfunding platforms in overcoming the barriers they face operating cross-border. The proposal does not intend to interfere with national bespoke regimes or existing licenses, including those under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), the Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), but rather to provide crowdfunding service providers with the possibility to apply for an EU label that empowers them to scale up their operations throughout the Union under certain conditions. Scope : the proposal applies to crowdfunding services involving financial remuneration for investors. Donation and reward-based crowdfunding are excluded from the scope of this initiative, as they cannot be considered financial services. The proposal does not include in its scope consumers lending for consumption purposes. Effective and prudent management : crowdfunding service providers must at all times comply with the organisational requirements, while natural persons having the power to manage a crowdfunding service provider should have appropriate skills and professional experience. A crowdfunding service provider must maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps designed to prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interests of its clients. Authorisation and monitoring : the proposal provides uniform, proportionate and directly applicable requirements for authorisation and a single point of supervision. Crowdfunding service providers will provide their services under the supervision of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Investor protection and transparency : the proposal also aims to provide investors with the necessary information on crowdfunding, including the underlying risks. Accordingly, all information, including marketing communications, from crowdfunding service providers to clients must be complete, clear and correct. The proposal sets out an initial assessment of the appropriateness of a potential client and provides that platforms shall offer investors the possibility to simulate their ability to bear losses. The proposed regulation also provides for adequate safeguards to minimize the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the preferred option holds implications in terms of costs and administrative burden for ESMA. Assuming that ESMA will be in charge of authorising and supervising 25 providers in the first full year of implementation (2020), there will be a cost impact (net of fees charged on the industry) of approximately EUR 1 637 000 in that year. This estimate also includes half of EUR 500 000 in one-off costs to be split over the first two years, used to setup the necessary IT systems. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 became applicable on 5 April 2010. In accordance with Article 51 of the Visa Code operational instructions on the practical application of the provisions of the Regulation have been drawn up by the Commission Decision establishing the Handbook for the processing of visa applications and the modification of issued visas adopted on 19 March 2010. During the preparation of the Handbook, it has been observed that the formulation of Article 3 (5) (b) and (c) relating to the exemption from airport transit visa (ATV) requirements was unclear. As the Handbook cannot create legally binding obligations on Member States, it is necessary to amend the Visa Code to establish legal certainty and a harmonised application of the rules. Such clarification is of practical importance for individual travellers and for airline companies. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the two aspects covered by the proposal have been discussed in the Visa Committee and in the Visa Working Party and Member States have supported the Commission taking the initiative for a limited amendment of the Visa Code. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77 (2) (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: according to Regulation (EC) No 810/2009, third country nationals subject to the airport transit visa requirement who hold a valid visa issued by a Member State, Canada, Japan or the United States of America or who hold a valid residence permit issued by a Member State, Andorra, Canada, Japan, San Marino or the United States of America are exempted from the ATV requirement. This proposal is restricted to a technical amendment involving the clarification of the existing text with a view to specifying that: third country nationals holding a valid visa or residence permit issued by a Member State not applying the common visa policy in full are to be covered by the ATV exemption; the ATV exemption covers the persons holding a valid visa when they travel to the third country that issued the visa, to any other third country, and when having used the visa they return from the third country that issued the visa.

The Treaty of Lisbon has substantially modified the legal framework governing the powers conferred on the Commission by the legislator, introducing a clear distinction between powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts). The proposed Regulation aims to adapt a series of basic instruments where the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS) applies to make them evolve into delegated acts. The European Parliament’s position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission's proposal to clarify that the power to adopt delegated acts would be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years. The Commission shall prepare a report on the delegation of authority no later than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of the same duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council objects to such an extension no later than three months before the end of each period. In a recital, Parliament pointed out that bundling and presenting empowerments that are not closely linked with each other within a single delegated act of the Commission impedes the exercise of Parliament's right of scrutiny, as it is forced to simply accept or refuse the entire delegated act, which leaves no room to express an opinion on each empowerment individually."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 establishing common rules for exports. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Regulation establishes the basic principle according to which the exportation of products from the Union to third countries shall be free, that is to say, they shall not be subject to any quantitative restriction, with the exception of those restrictions which are applied in conformity with the provisions of this Regulation. It should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural. The main elements of the proposed Regulation concern: Union information and consultation procedure : if, as a result of any unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission, which shall advise the other Member States. For the purpose of assessing the economic and commercial situation as regards a particular product, the Commission may request Member States to supply statistical data on market trends in that product and, to this end. Safeguard measures : in order to prevent a critical situation from arising on account of a shortage of essential products, or to remedy such a situation, and where Union interests call for immediate intervention, the Commission, acting at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, may make the export of a product subject to the production of an export authorisation. The European Parliament, the Council and the Member States shall be notified of the measures taken. Such measures shall take effect immediately. Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Union should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations. For the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safeguards. The implementing measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on comitology."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the need for statistical information on businesses for policymaking and other purposes is growing. However, the current system for producing European business statistics is fragmented into separate domain-specific regulations which leads to inconsistencies in the data collected and inefficiencies in their production. The draft Regulation on European business statistics, amending Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 and repealing 10 legal acts in the field of business statistics (FRIBS) is part of the Commission’s REFIT Programme. This programme seeks to simplify EU law and reduce unnecessary regulatory costs. It identified business statistics as one of its priority area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is the one which seeks to modernise the European business statistics in a single framework (FRIBS) using a mix of measures, including alternative options for the modernisation of Intrastat. This option shall enable European business statistics to be put into one single legal framework FRIBS which will implicitly guarantee much higher consistency of business statistics. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes a common legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics related to the structure, the economic activities and the performance of businesses, as well as on the international transactions and research and development activities of the Union economy. The proposal envisages the integration of statistical requirements and legal acts for business statistics by streamlining and simplifying them and reducing the burden on businesses. It is expected to deliver: better quality European Statistical System (ESS) business registers, common definitions to be used in all the statistical domains it covers, the exchange of identifiable micro-data and an integrated data structure. The proposed Regulation covers the following issues: data sources to be used for business statistics and statistical business registers; business statistics (subject areas and the topics) as well as the periodicity with which the topics need to be provided; business registers. The Commission (Eurostat) shall set up the EuroGroups Register of multinational enterprise groups for statistical purposes at Union level; exchange of confidential data for the purpose of intra-Union trade in goods statistics; quality, transmission and dissemination: data quality and metadata reporting, data and metadata transmission and confidentiality regarding statistical data dissemination on international trade in goods. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial impact of the proposal is of unlimited duration with a start-up period of 3 years, from 2019 to 2021. The total appropriations for 2019 and 2020 are estimated at EUR 46.453 million.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to the 2010 Commission report on the protection of the Union's financial interests, suspected fraud amounts to approximately 600 million euro annually on the revenue and expenditure side despite the legal framework in place. It can be assumed that the actual amount is even higher as not all cases are detected and reported. The damage to the EU budget calls for action to ensure equivalent and effective protection of the Union's financial interests, including criminal law as far as this proves necessary. Despite the development of an EU acquis in this area which includes fraud, corruption and money laundering, Member States have adopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection within their national legal systems. According to the Commission, the actual common definition of offences in all Member States would reduce the risks of divergent practice, as they would ensure a uniform interpretation and a homogeneous way to meet all the necessary prosecution requirements. They would also strengthen the deterrent effect and enforcement potential of relevant provisions The proposal follows on from the Commission’s May 2011 communication “On the protection of the Union’s financial interests by criminal law and by administrative investigations” and the September 2011 communication “Towards a European criminal policy: Ensuring the effective implementation of EU policies through criminal law”. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the outcome of an external study which was completed in February 2012. The impact assessment concludes that a solution which in particular would extend the types of some fraud-related offences, introduce minimum sanctions and harmonise statutory limitation is to be preferred. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces the proposal for a Directive on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests. It seeks to set out harmonised criminal law provisions in the field of the protection of the Union's financial interests, while allowing Member States a certain degree of flexibility as regards how to impose more stringent provisions. In particular, the proposal: introduces a definition of the Union’s financial interests (fraud in relation to VAT is considered as affecting the EU's financial interests and is therefore covered by this proposed Directive); provides a definition of fraudulent behaviour to be criminalised in the Member States; provides that dishonest conduct of tenderers in public procurement is to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of corruption to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of misappropriation, which covers conduct by public officials that does not constitute fraud in a stricter sense, and which consists in the misappropriation of funds or assets contrary to the purpose foreseen, with the intention to damage the Union's financial interests; makes reference to anti-money laundering legislation (Directive 2005/60/EC) with respect to money-laundering of the proceeds of the offences, so that such money laundering will be criminalised in the Member States; requires Member States to criminalise also forms of preparation of and participation in the offences of incitement, aiding and abetting, attempt; requires Member States to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons; requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, and to set out a certain minimum set of criminal sanctions for natural persons; requires certain minimum imprisonment terms for particularly serious offences, based on thresholds set out for each offence; requires the existence of means of freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities from these offences; requires the Member States to take the necessary measures to establish their competence bases in regard to criminal offences so as to allow the judicial authorities to initiate investigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to the Union's financial interests. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this proposal has no immediate budgetary implications for the Union. Its aim is, however, to prevent losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests by increasing deterrence and making enforcement by criminal law authorities of the Member States more effective, as well as to facilitate recovery in cases where losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests have already occurred."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while the proposal for a Regulation establishing the framework programme for research and innovation ‘Horizon Europe’ for the period 2021-2027 sets out the general and specific objectives of Horizon Europe, the structure and the broad lines of activities to be carried out, this proposal for a Decision aims to define the operational objectives and the activities which are specific to parts of Horizon Europe. The Horizon Europe proposal is in line with the Commission proposal on the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The proposal is framed by the premise that research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values, and enabling solutions that address challenges in a more systemic way. CONTENT: the proposal for a Decision seeks to establish the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe - the framework programme for research and innovation. It lays down the operational objectives of the specific programme, the budget for the period 2021 – 2027, the rules for implementation of the specific programme and activities to be carried out under this programme. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ includes five thematic clusters that address the full spectrum of global challenges through top-down collaborative R&I activities: (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. A small number of missions with specific goals will be launched from within the pillar. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ which essentially consists of: (i) scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation through a new European Innovation Council; (ii) activities aiming at enhancing and developing the overall European innovation landscape, including support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). Strategic planning : the implementation of Horizon Europe shall be steered by an inclusive and transparent strategic planning process of the research and innovation activities the programme will fund. The strategic planning exercise shall lay out a multiannual strategy for the development of work programme content, though it will remain sufficiently flexible to respond rapidly to unexpected needs and crises. This proposal lays down specific provisions for the programming and implementation of the framework programme, in particular for: (1) Missions (under the global issues and industrial competitiveness pillar ): these missions shall be co-designed and decided as part of the Horizon Europe strategic planning process, which shall include collaboration between the relevant Commission services, Member States, the European Parliament and relevant stakeholders. The first few missions shall be introduced in the first strategic planning exercise. Based on the first two years' experience, the number and scale of missions may be increased in subsequent work programmes. Whilst the duration of the Union support to missions shall not be expected to exceed 10 years and shall be subject to regular review (through the work programme cycle), the timeframe for expected impact of missions may spread out beyond this timeframe. For co-designing the missions and steering their implementation, the Commission may set up mission boards whose members shall be appointed by the Commission, following an open call for expressions of interest. (2) The European Research Council (ERC) : the Commission shall establish a European Research Council (ERC) to implement the actions under Pillar I 'Open Science' which relate to the ERC. The ERC shall be composed of the independent Scientific Council and the dedicated implementation structure responsible for the administrative implementation and programme execution. The President shall be appointed by the Commission following a transparent recruitment process involving an independent dedicated search committee, for a term of office limited to four years, renewable once. (3) The European Innovation Council (EIC) : to implement the EIC, the Commission shall establish a high level board (the EIC Board) that shall advise, inter alia, on the overall strategy, objectives, activities, evaluation criteria and selection of experts. The EIC shall be the sole channel for the Union support to breakthrough market-creating innovation. It shall provide direct tailor-made support to innovators through two main funding instruments – the Pathfinder and the Accelerator – which shall both focus through a mainly bottom-up, high-risk approach on breakthrough innovation; on innovator needs and be pro-actively managed. (4) Work programmes : the programme shall be implemented by work programmes referred to in Article 110 of Financial Regulation. They shall be prepared following a strategic planning process. Work programmes shall set out, where applicable, the overall amount reserved for blending operations. (5) Committee procedure : for the implementation of Horizon Europe, the Commission shall be assisted by a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. It would meet in different configurations according to the matter to be discussed. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the framework programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the customs 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing customs cooperation. Many of the activities in the customs area are of a cross-border nature, involving and affecting all Member States, and therefore they cannot be effectively and efficiently delivered by individual Member States. Since 2016, the Union Customs Code is the new legal customs framework. The Code triggered a massive digitalisation project with 17 different electronic systems to be fully in place by 2020. Some systems will be deployed gradually up to 2025. These electronic systems touch upon all customs procedures. The upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU implies disentangling the United Kingdom as a Member State from all existing customs electronic systems financed by customs 2020. These implications and costs however cannot be precisely estimated at this stage. The implementation of all these aspects can only be achieved through intense operational cooperation between customs administrations of the Member States, between them and other authorities, with trade and other third parties. It is therefore necessary to ensure the continuity of the Union’s financing of customs cooperation activities by establishing a new cooperation programme in this area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the customs programme for cooperation in the field of customs for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the customs 2020 programme. Objective : the general objective of the proposed new programme is to support the customs union and customs authorities to protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, to ensure security and safety within the Union and to protect the Union from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity. Customs cooperation and capacity building shall focus, on the one hand, on human networking and competency building actions and, on the other hand, IT capacity building actions. Like the current Customs 2020 programme, the new programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. It may provide funding in any form provided for in the Financial Regulation, in particular grants, procurements and reimbursement of expenses. Eligible actions : the programme shall cover expenses for preparation, monitoring, control, audit, evaluation and other activities for managing the programme and evaluating the achievement of its objectives. It shall also cover expenses relating to studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions, in so far as they are related to the objectives of the programme, as well as expenses linked to information technology networks focusing on information processing and exchange, including corporate information technology tools and other technical and administrative assistance needed in connection with the management of the programme. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of the European electronic systems ‘common components’ and ‘national components’ reflecting better the reality of electronic systems and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand and the Member States on the other hand have been listed. Lastly, a multi-annual strategic plan for customs, to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 950 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: powers which may be delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a particular legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the implementing powers which shall be conferred on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed, as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers, the Commission has committed itself to reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU, legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (previously known as “comitology”). The overall objective is to remove all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny from all legislative instruments by the end of Parliament’s seventh term (June 2014). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 in order to align it with the new institutional context. It is proposed to: empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in order to provide a satisfactory response to users' needs for statistical information without imposing excessive burdens on economic operators, to take into account changes necessary for methodological reasons and the necessity to set up an efficient system for the collection of data and the compilation of statistics; confer implementing powers on the Commission enabling it to adopt measures in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, the arrangements for collecting Intrastat information, particularly concerning the codes to be used, technical provisions for compiling annual statistics on trade by business characteristics and any measures necessary to ensure the quality of the statistics transmitted according to the quality criteria. The Commission is also proposing to: clarify the definition of “statistical value” and align the current definition of this data element in intra-EU trade statistics with that of the extra-EU trade statistics; restructure the European Statistical System (ESS) to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure, with the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC. In February 2012, the ESSC supported this new approach. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union’s General Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is committed to protect and improve human health, in particular to combat the major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed shortcomings in the EU’s mechanisms for managing health threats. The proposal builds on lessons learnt during the COVID-19 crisis, and proposes to strengthen the existing Union level structures and mechanisms for improved levels of protection, prevention, preparedness and response, against all health hazards across the EU. The proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to reinforce the crisis preparedness and response and enhance the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Together, they form part of the EU’s overall health response to COVID-19 as well as an improved crisis management framework. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the Centre’s founding regulation in order to reinforce its mandate so that it may support the Commission and Member States in the following areas: epidemiological surveillance via integrated systems enabling real-time surveillance preparedness and response planning, reporting and auditing situational awareness: rapid digitalisation of integrated surveillance systems; better preparedness in Member States: develop prevention and response plans against future epidemics and stronger capacities for integrated rapid epidemic and outbreak response; reinforced measures to control epidemics and outbreaks: provision of nonbinding recommendations for risk management; reinforced capacity and to identify population groups at risk and in need of targeted prevention and response measures; building up the key competences for health protection in Member States: the Centre will be tasked with coordinating a new network of Union reference laboratories for public health and a new network of national services supporting transfusion, transplantation and medically assisted reproduction; expanding work on the prevention of communicable diseases and specific health issues, e.g., antimicrobial resistance, vaccination and biosecurity; reinforcing the contribution to the EU’s international cooperation and development and EU commitment to global health security preparedness. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications should relate mainly to: setting-up a new vaccine monitoring platform hosted jointly by the European Medicines Agency and the Centre; new networks on Union reference laboratories and on transfusion, transplantation and medically assisted reproduction; reinforcing surveillance systems and the Early Warning and Response System; monitoring and assessing health systems capacity and identifying population groups at risk and in need of targeted prevention and response measures; creating a ‘EU Health Task Force’ to support countries with preparedness strengthening and quickly intervene in a health crisis; improving international collaboration and gathering of regional/national intelligence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Moldova is experiencing difficulties with its wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the Moldovan government. This has led Moldova to request the European Commission in July 2010 to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine under the Autonomous Trade Preferences, granted to Moldova by Council Regulation (EC) 55/2008. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the wine sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 300 000 people (one fourth of the working population), who are mainly living in rural areas and cultivating medium to smaller family plots. It is therefore proposed to provide a measure to improve the general level of wine imports from Moldova to support the economic development of this country. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide a positive outlook to the people working in the wine industry in Moldova, it is proposed to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine: for 2011 from 100 000 hectolitres (hl) to 150 000 hl, for 2012 from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl, from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year. The level of the proposed increase is based on the fact that Moldova has systematically exhausted the existing quota and the potential of the sector to improve its niche markets in the EU, while at the same time the level of the increase does not destabilise the EU wine industry. It is expected that Moldova's wine sector will continue to improve the quality of its wines. As Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 expires on 31 December 2012, and as it is important to ensure legal certainty for producers, exporters and importers, it is proposed to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 for another three years to 31 December 2015. This is a reasonable amount of time, taking into account the perspectives for a future deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA) between the EU and Moldova. Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 foresees preferential tariff quotas also on other products in addition to wine. Having assessed the situation in the different sectors covered by the quotas, it is proposed to continue the progressive increase of some of those other quotas for the levels indicated in the annexed to this proposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EU budget. As the general level of imports from Moldova is merely 0.04% of all EU imports further market opening is not expected to create negative effects for the EU. Currently around 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU free of duties. The additional duty free tariff quotas proposed for the years 2011 to 2015 will result in a small loss of tariff revenue only for the year 2011. For the years 2012 to 2015 there will not be any loss of tariff revenue since present export volumes from Moldova of all the products covered by duty free tariff quotas are covered by the 2012 level of these quotas. Hypothetical revenue that could have been generated by future exports is not considered as a loss of tariff revenue."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation requires that applications for marketing authorisation for a medicinal product, in a Member State or in the Union, be accompanied by a dossier containing the results of clinical trials carried out on the product. Sponsors are required, before the commencement of any clinical trial, to request authorisation from the competent authority of the Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Clinical trials necessitate the performance of multiple operations which may fall within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC (Directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms) or Directive 2009/41/EC (Directive on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms) in cases where the investigational medicinal product contains or consists of GMOs. Experience shows that, in clinical trials with investigational medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs, the procedure to achieve compliance with the requirements of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC as regards the environmental impact assessment and authorisation by the competent authority of a Member State is complex and may take a significant amount of time. The complexity of that procedure increases greatly in the case of multi-centre clinical trials conducted in several Member States, as sponsors of clinical trials need to submit multiple requests for authorisation to multiple competent authorities in different Member States in parallel. The Commission considers that it is of paramount importance that clinical trials with investigational medicinal products against COVID-19 containing or consisting of GMOs can be conducted within the Union, that they can begin as soon as possible, and that they are not delayed due to the complexity of differing national procedures put in place by Member States in implementation of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC. CONTENT: in the public health emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed Regulation aims to ensure that clinical trials with medicinal products for human use containing or consisting of GMOs to treat or prevent COVID-19 can start swiftly and without a prior environmental risk assessment and/or prior consent under Directive 2001/18/EC or Directive 2009/41/EC. The Regulation shall apply for as long as COVID-19 is considered a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or declared an emergency situation in accordance with Decision No 1082/2013/EU and remains so."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : in its Energy Union strategy of 25 February 2015, the Commission stressed the need for an integrated governance to make sure that energy-related actions at Union, regional, national and local level all contribute to the Energy Union's objectives, thereby broadening the scope of Governance – beyond the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy – to all five key dimensions of the Energy Union. These are (i) energy security; (ii) internal energy market; (iii) moderation of demand; (iv) decarbonisation; and (v) research, innovation and competitiveness. In its resolution of 15 December 2015, the European Parliament called for the Energy Union governance to be ambitious, reliable, transparent, and democratic and fully inclusive of the European Parliament and to ensure that the 2030 climate and energy targets are achieved. Current planning and reporting requirements (for both the Commission and Member States) in the energy and climate fields provide benefits, but they are found in a wide range of separate pieces of legislation adopted at different points in time. Moreover, some of the current requirements have been defined with a view to achieving the corresponding 2020 targets, and are not suited to supporting the achievement of the 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate, nor are they synchronised with the planning and reporting obligations under the Paris Agreement, which was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2015 (COP 21). The proposal has been prepared in parallel to the reviews in the energy policy sector, particularly regarding renewable energy, energy efficiency and market design. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that a new, single legal act fully incorporating the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) is the preferred option. The regulatory fitness check (REFIT) supporting the proposed Regulation suggests that a significant reduction of administrative burden on Member States as well as on the Commission could be expected from the new approach, but it can only partially quantify such impacts due to the limited availability of reliable data. CONTENT: the draft regulation aims at ensuring a coordinated and coherent implementation of the Energy Union Strategy across its five dimensions, as well as the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives through a combination of EU and national measures on the basis of streamlined planning, reporting and monitoring obligations and a functional governance process between the Commission and Member States. Specifically, the proposal brings together the existing scattered planning and reporting obligations from the main pieces of EU legislation across energy, climate and other Energy Union related policy areas and thereby achieve a major simplification of obligations, by reducing, aligning and updating such requirements, and removing duplications. In all, the proposal integrates, streamlines or repeals more than 50 existing individual planning, reporting and monitoring obligations of the energy and climate acquis. More precisely, the proposal: sets out the obligation for Member States to produce a national integrated energy and climate plan for the period 2021 to 2030 by 1 January 2019, as well as for subsequent ten-year periods; establishes a consultation process between the Commission and Member States before the finalisation of the plan, based on the draft national plan to be provided to the Commission by 1 January 2018, and every ten years thereafter for the following ten year periods. In this framework, the Commission will be able to make recommendations regarding the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions as well as on specific policies and measures included in the plan. Other Member States will also be able to comment on the draft plan in the framework of regional consultations. The plans need to be updated by 1 January 2024 (still with a 2030 perspective); sets out the obligation for Member States to prepare and report to the Commission long-term low emission strategies with a 50 years perspective, which are key to contribute towards broader sustainable development goals, as well as moving towards the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement; sets out the obligation for Member States to produce biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans from 2021 onwards across the five dimensions of the Energy Union to track progress; sets out the obligation of the Commission to monitor and assess Member States’ progress in relation to the objectives set in the national plan; sets out the requirements for national and Union inventory systems for GHG emissions, policies, measures and projections; sets out the mechanisms and principles for cooperation and support between Member States and the Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: officials, temporary agents or external personnel working in the Energy and Climate action policy areas will be allocated for the performance of the tasks in the Commission, within the existing overall human resources. Regarding the European Environment Agency, a phasing in of additional contract agents (up to 3 in 2020) is requested on top of the existing human resources programming for the EEA. The costs resulting from the implementation of the proposed regulation (estimated at EUR 9.908 million, including administrative expenses) will be fully accommodated under the current programmed financial envelope of the budget items in question until 2020. As far as the financial resources needed for the European Environment Agency (EUR 1.635 million) are concerned, those will be additional to the current financial programming.

The legislative procedure to adopt the Statute of the European ombudsman is of special constitutional and institutional nature. On the one hand, Parliament has an authentic right of legislative initiative, the so-called direct right of initiative. On the other hand, consent of the Council is required and the Commission must give its opinion. Given the approval of the Council and the European Commission’s favourable opinion, Parliament adopted the regulation laying down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties. In concrete terms, the proposed regulation: - sets out the conditions under which a complaint can be made to the Ombudsman; - provides for procedures to be followed when the Ombudsman's enquiries reveal maladministration; - allow the Ombudsman, without prejudice to his or her primary duty, which is to handle complaints, to conduct own-initiative inquiries whenever he or she finds grounds, and in particular in repeated, systemic or particularly serious instances of maladministration; - provides for the possibility for the Ombudsman to conduct an enquiry to identify maladministration in the context of raising alerts. The Ombudsman should have access to all elements required for the performance of his or her duties. To that end, the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should provide the Ombudsman with any information that he or she requests for the purposes of an inquiry. The Ombudsman and his or her staff should be obliged to treat in confidence any information which they have acquired in the course of their duties, without prejudice to the Ombudsman's obligation to inform the authorities of the Member States of facts which might relate to criminal offences and have come to his or her attention in the course of an inquiry. The Ombudsman should also be able to inform the Union institution, body, office or agency concerned of the facts that call into question the conduct of a member of their staff. Where necessary for the effective performance of his or her duties, the Ombudsman should be given the possibility to cooperate and exchange information with the authorities of the Member States, in compliance with the applicable national and Union law, and with other Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, in particular those responsible for the defence and protection of fundamental rights. The draft regulation stipulates that the Ombudsman should be appointed by the European Parliament at the beginning of the parliamentary term and for the duration thereof, chosen from among persons who are citizens of the Union and who offer all requisite guarantees of independence and competence. General conditions should also be laid down inter alia concerning the cessation of the Ombudsman's duties, the replacement of the Ombudsman, incompatibilities, the remuneration of the Ombudsman and the privileges and immunities of the Ombudsman.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the adoption and entry into force of international rules on liability for non-contractual damages arising from the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) by sea is crucial in view of the significant share HNS cargo represents in maritime freight transport worldwide. The International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, ('1996 HNS Convention') was aimed at ensuring adequate, prompt and effective compensation of persons who suffer damage caused by spills of hazardous and noxious substances, when carried by sea. The Protocol of 2010 to the 1996 HNS Convention contained necessary amendments to address problems identified in the 1996 HNS Convention. The 2010 Protocol and the provisions of the Convention, are to be read, interpreted and applied together as one single instrument. Neither the 1996 HNS Convention, nor the 2010 Protocol to the HNS Convention has entered into force. The latter has no contracting parties to it to this day. The 2010 Protocol, and thereby the consolidated 2010 HNS Convention, will enter into force 18 months after the date on which at least 12 States, 4 of which with no less than 2 million units of gross tonnage each, have ratified it, and the relevant data on contributing cargo have been submitted to the IMO Secretary-General showing no less than 40 million tonnes of cargo contributing to the general HNS account received in total in those States during the preceding calendar year. The main changes from the 1996 HNS Convention to the 2010 HNS Convention are: Given that issues related to judicial to judicial cooperation in civil matters do not apply to Denmark, the Council must adopt two separate decisions. Accordingly, a parallel draft decision aims to ratify the Protocol of 2010 with the exception of aspects related to judicial cooperation in civil matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: whilst no formal impact assessment was required, several options have been examined and weighed. The Commission considers that the conclusion of the 2010 Protocol to the HNS Convention will ensure: Using an international regime rather than regional solutions for these purposes better suits the nature of shipping as a global business. CONTENT: under the draft Council Decision, Member States: State signature, ratification or acceptance of the 2010 Protocol nullifies any prior signature or ratification by that State of the 1996 HNS Convention. States ratifying the Protocol express their consent to be bound by the consolidated text of the 2010 HNS Convention, as a single, consolidated instrument for the Convention, which will take effect once the 2010 Protocol enters into force. Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and is not bound by this Decision or subject to its application."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: designed to support the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative ""Innovation Union"", the basic principle of ""Horizon 2020"" is to adopt a much more strategic approach to research and innovation. All policy instruments and measures are designed to contribute to research and innovation and to develop further the European Research Area whereby knowledge, researchers and technology circulate freely, and to accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation across the Single Market. The set consists of the proposals for: · a Framework Programme for Horizon 2020; · a single set of Rules for Participation and Dissemination ; · a single specific programme to implement Horizon 2020; · a single proposal for the parts of Horizon 2020 corresponding to the Euratom Treaty. This proposal makes it clear that the rules for the participation and dissemination should adequately reflect the recommendations of the European Parliament, as summarised in the ""Report on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework Programmes"". Furthermore, following extensive public consultation based on a Green Paper, ""From challenges to opportunities: towards a common strategic framework for Union research and innovation funding"", the following obstacles were identified to participation rules: · the most important one from the participant's perspective is the complexity of administrative procedures along with the administrative burden; · participants also find it very burdensome to apply different sets of rules depending on the Union research and innovation programme and they called for a greater consistency of rules between instruments; · currently too many procedures, in particular regarding financial controls, appear to be designed exclusively to ensure a very low risk of errors, but also result in control mechanisms perceived as rigid and excessive. A risk/ trust balance is required. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the four proposals rely on two in-depth impact assessments, drawing on stakeholder consultations, internal and external evaluations, and contributions from international experts. The assessments found that the Horizon 2020 option would bring more clarity of focus, best achieve the necessary critical mass of effort at programme and project level, and lead to the greatest impact on the policy objectives and downstream economic, competitiveness, and social benefits, while at the same time helping to simplify matters by easing the administrative burden for participants, streamlining the applicable rules and procedures, ensuring consistency between instruments and pointing to a new risk/trust balance. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 173, 183 and the second paragraph of Article 188 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal lays down specific rules for the participation in indirect actions undertaken under Horizon 2020, and also lays down the rules governing the dissemination of results. The Regulation shall not apply to direct actions carried out by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The rules proposed were drawn up with the twofold aim of: · ensuring a single and sufficiently flexible regulatory framework which will render participation easier, create a more coherent set of instruments covering both research and innovation and increase the scientific and economic impact while avoiding duplication and fragmentation. · simplifying the terms and procedures from the perspective of the participants to ensure the most efficient implementation, taking into account the need for easy access for all participants. The following new features have been introduced into the rules for participation and dissemination in order to apply the above principles and to bring the rules into line with the characteristics and objectives of the new framework programme: · the rules will apply to all components of ""Horizon 2020"", including initiatives under Articles 185 and 187 TFEU, actions currently falling within the scope of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme as well as the EIT activities. The necessary flexibility corresponding to the different nature of the research and innovation actions is ensured by appropriate derogations and by allowing to set out specific participation details in the work programmes; · the rules for participation relating to the Union funding are based on the revised Regulation on the financial rules applicable to the annual budget of the Union which has streamlined and rendered more efficient the way in which Union policies can be implemented; · the financial provisions relating to the Union funding in the form of grants have been clarified and simplified. Thus, they are now establishing a single funding rate depending for each type of action funded under ""Horizon 2020"" with no differentiation among participants. Enhanced use of lump sums, flat rates and scale of unit costs is also proposed; · for direct costs, these rules provide for a broad acceptance of the usual accounting practices of grant beneficiaries, subject to a minimum number of boundary conditions. The grant agreement will include further simplification provisions allowing beneficiaries to gain legal certainty on the eligibility of the costs charged to actions under ""Horizon 2020"". Those simplification provisions will include, among others, a clear definition of the time recording requirements and objective references regarding the annual productive hours; · for indirect costs, the calculation is radically simplified. The reimbursement involves a flat rate based on total direct eligible costs of participants with a possibility to declare costs actually incurred which is limited to non-profit legal entities; · rules applying to the new forms of funding allow for more flexibility, such as those related to prizes to be awarded for the achievement of pre-specified targets or those related to public pre-commercial procurement and procurement of innovative solutions as well as those related to the financial instruments; · given its demonstrated efficiency as a safeguard mechanism, the participants' Guarantee Fund set up under the Seventh Framework Programme will be renewed for the entire duration of ""Horizon 2020"" with clearer rules and the possibility to extend it to cover risks undertaken in actions under the EURATOM Framework Programme; · the rules regarding intellectual property, exploitation and dissemination have been modelled on the widely acknowledged Seventh Framework Programme provisions with further improvements and clarifications: (i) specific new emphasis has been put on open access to research publications and an opening was made for experiments with open access to other results; (ii) the enlarged scope and new forms of funding as well as the need for flexibility in this area of the rules has been taken into account by the possibility to lay down additional or specific provisions where appropriate; (iii) access rights for the EU, and in the field of security research also for Member States, have been provided; · the participation of legal entities established in third countries and of international organisations in actions under ""Horizon 2020"" will be streamlined and stimulated, in line with the objectives of international cooperation set out in the Treaty, based on mutual benefits and taking into account the conditions for the participation of EU entities to third countries’ programmes. Within the clear and stable framework, participants will enjoy further flexibility to determine the most appropriate internal arrangements for the implementation of their actions. This should encourage and facilitate the participation of all research stakeholders, including small research units, particularly SMEs.

On 11 February 2021, the Conference of Presidents took the decision to authorise the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to split the Commission proposal into two parts and to draw up two separate legislative reports on this basis. As a reminder, Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 of the European Parliament and of the Council established the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) for third-country nationals exempt from the requirement to be in possession of a visa when crossing external borders. It laid down the conditions and procedures for issuing or refusing a travel authorisation under that system. ETIAS enables consideration of whether the presence of those third-country nationals in the territory of the Member States would pose a security, illegal immigration or high epidemic risk. In order to enable the processing of application files by the ETIAS Central System, the proposed amending regulation defines the modalities of interoperability between the ETIAS information system, other EU information systems and Europol data, as well as the conditions for the consultation of data stored in other EU information systems and Europol data should be implemented in the ETIAS automated processing for the purpose of identifying hits. Accordingly, this regulation amends Regulations (EU) 2019/816 and (EU) 2019/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to connect the ETIAS Central System to the other EU information systems and to Europol data and to specify the data that will be sent to and from those EU information systems and Europol data. The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the proposal as follows: Subject matter of Regulation (EU) 2019/816 The amendments introduced clarify that Regulation (EU) 2019/816 establishes the conditions under which data contained in the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN) may be used by the ETIAS Central Unit in order to allow for a thorough assessment of the security risks posed by applicants before their arrival at external border crossing points. Entry of data in the ECRIS-TCN For each convicted third-country national, the central authority of the convicting Member State is required to create a data file in the Central System. This file should contain a flag indicating that the third-country national concerned has been convicted in the past 25 years of a terrorist offence or in the previous 15 years of any other criminal offence listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2018/1240, where those criminal offences are punishable under national law by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years, and in those cases the code of the convicting Member State(s). Flags and the code of the convicting Member State(s) should be accessible and searchable only by the Visa Information System (VIS) and the ETIAS system for verification purposes. Retention period of stored data The flags should be erased automatically upon the expiry of the retention period referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article or at the latest, 25 years after the creation of the flag, as far as convictions related to terrorist offences are concerned, and 15 years after the creation of the flag, as far as convictions related to other serious criminal offences are concerned Each ECRIS-TCN data processing operation in the Common Identity Records (CIR) and ETIAS should be recorded."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The principal objective of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and the Council is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Union. For that purpose, a system of certificates has been established for various aviation activities, in order to achieve the required safety levels and to enable the necessary verifications and the mutual acceptance of certificates issued. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement affects in particular the validity of certificates and licenses originating from the United Kingdom issued under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139. The Commission proposes therefore to set up a temporary mechanism, to extend the validity of certain aviation safety certificates, in order to allow the operators concerned and the Agency sufficient time to issue the necessary certificates under Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, taking account of the United Kingdom's status as a third country. CONTENT: the proposal aims to put in place a mechanism to temporarily extend (for 9 months) the validity of certain aviation safety certificates in the absence of an agreement to withdraw the United Kingdom from the Union. It would thus allow post-Brexit EU-27 manufacturers to continue their production and operators to continue to use these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. This Regulation shall apply to the certificates listed in the Annex to this Regulation, which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by any of the following: - the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom as set out in Section 1 of the Annex; - natural or legal persons certified by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom as set out in Section 2 of the Annex. The Commission shall have the power to adopt delegated acts in order to extend the period of validity of the certificates referred to in Section 1 of the Annex to the Regulation. Lastly, the content and exams of certain trainings addressed under the proposal are regulated in a detailed manner under Union law and consist of standardised modules, which should normally be completed in one Member State, before a transfer to another Member State jurisdiction is possible."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has led to a massive influx of displaced persons from Ukraine into several Member States. This places renewed pressure on the financial resources of Member States to deal with urgent migration, border management and security needs. Taking into account the nature and dimension of the crisis, these unforeseen needs will persist beyond 2022. This invasion has given rise to increased needs in areas, such as migration and border management, directly covered by the Home Affairs Funds (2014-2020). The Commission considers it necessary to widen the scope of use of Home Affairs Funds as much as possible, by extending the period of eligibility and by unblocking access to unspent earmarked resources, thus avoiding the loss of unused funding following decommitment. This overall flexibility is necessary to ensure a comprehensive approach to migration management, based on mutual trust, solidarity and shared responsibility between Member States and EU institutions. CONTENT: the proposal aims to support Member States to address the consequences of the war in Ukraine, by facilitating access to unspent financial resources for the 2014-2020 programming period under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund insofar as it concerns the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, 2 as well as the Internal Security Fund insofar as it concerns the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management. Specifically, the proposal aims to: - extend the implementation period of the Home Affairs Funds 2014-2020 by one year. This extension will enable Member States to urgently utilise remaining funds to help address the increased pressure on their border and migration management systems arising from the invasion in Ukraine; - unlock access to unspent earmarked resources under the AMIF 2014-2020 to enable Member States to better address the increased pressure on their asylum and migration management systems stemming from the invasion of Ukraine. This access will be provided by amending Regulation (EU) 516/2014 establishing the AMIF and laying down provisions for its use; - enable the use of External Assigned Revenue under the AMIF 2021-2027. The proposed amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 aims to give Member States and other public or private donors the possibility, under the 2021-2027 programming period, to make additional financial contributions to asylum and migration management in the form of external assigned revenue. This external assigned revenue will constitute a dedicated contribution from Member States and other public or private donors to finance specific items of expenditure under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 24 February 2022, Russia launched a military aggression against Ukraine. There are reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been and are being committed in Ukraine. Given the seriousness of the situation, the EU should urgently take all necessary measures to ensure that those who committed these crimes in Ukraine are held accountable. As the European Union's platform for judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Eurojust provides support to national authorities investigating and prosecuting serious crime within its competence. Among others, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are crimes that fall within the competence of Eurojust. National authorities are currently collecting evidence of international crimes allegedly committed in Ukraine. Due to the ongoing hostilities, the evidence cannot be safely stored in Ukraine, which requires that a back-up/storage location be urgently found by the Union. Therefore, in order to coordinate the ongoing efforts of Member States to collect evidence, there is a need for the rapid establishment of a central storage system, where evidence collected by EU agencies and bodies as well as national and international authorities or third parties such as civil society organisations can be stored. In order to carry out its tasks, Eurojust has set up a Case Management System, which contains non-personal data and personal data as referred to in Annex II of the Eurojust Regulation. Recent events related to the Russian aggression against Ukraine have demonstrated the urgent need to go beyond the existing Eurojust case management system. Indeed, the current data processing architecture within Eurojust does not allow Eurojust to collect, store and analyse evidence on major international crimes, including those suspected to be committed in Ukraine. CONTENT: the proposal aims to improve Eurojust's ability to achieve its objectives as set out in the Eurojust Regulation by establishing an updated technical solution within Eurojust to assist Member States' authorities in dealing with genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. To this end, the proposal aims to enable Eurojust to collect, store, analyse and exchange evidence relating to major international crimes by setting up an automated data management and storage facility outside the case management system. This information and evidence (physical and electronic) could be used both for criminal cases before national courts and for prosecutions by the International Criminal Court or any other court or mechanism established for this purpose. However, the proposal does not aim to introduce any obligation on national authorities to share such information and evidence. In view of the sensitive nature of the personal data involved, their processing, including collection, preservation, analysis and exchange, must comply with the highest standards of data protection and cyber security. The proposal also aims to extend the categories of data that Eurojust can legally process to videos and audio recordings as well as satellite images and any relevant photographs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal would have an impact on Eurojust’s budget and its staff needs. It is estimated that further EUR 15.705 million would be needed for the period 2022-2027 to allow Eurojust to perform the tasks provided for by this proposal. This includes the costs for the setting up and management of the automated data management and storage facility (approximately EUR 500 000 per year) and for the necessary human resources to handle it."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: driving and resting times of drivers are regulated under EU law. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (the 'Driving Time Regulation') and Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on tachographs are part of a wider effort to improve the working conditions of drivers, ensure fair competition between operators and improve the road safety of European roads. An evaluation the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the existing set of Union social rules in road transport, identified certain deficiencies in the existing legal framework. Unclear and unsuitable rules on weekly rest, resting facilities, breaks in multi-manning and the absence of rules on the return of drivers to their home, lead to diverging interpretations and enforcement practices in the Member States. The objective of this proposal is to rectify the identified shortcomings and to help improve the working and business conditions in the sector in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a combination of two policy options: the first focused on strengthening enforcement, whilst the second established sector-specific criteria for posting workers in road transport and provides for specific enforcement measures. The impacts of the preferred option include improving the working and resting conditions of drivers (decrease in fatigue index by 28% and in periods away from home by 43% for EU-13 drivers and by 16% for EU-15 drivers). CONTENT: the proposal introduces a limited number of modifications to Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on driving time and Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on tachygraphs. Driving time : the main amendments proposed are as follows: private individuals using vehicles which would fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, to carry private belongings for their own purposes, are not obliged to record their driving times and rest periods and are therefore not obliged to have or use a tachograph or a driver's card; there is a uniform definition of the notion of 'non-commercial' carriage; drivers will have to record all tasks other than driving and also record any periods of availability; this will effectively monitor a driver's working patterns; drivers may arrange for their weekly rest periods in a more flexible manner over a period of four consecutive weeks, while ensuring that compensation for a reduced weekly rest is taken together with a regular weekly rest within three weeks. Any compensation for a reduced weekly rest must be attached to a regular weekly rest of at least 45 hours; a driver is not allowed to take a weekly rest of 45 hours or more in a vehicle. An employer is obliged to provide a driver with adequate accommodation with appropriate sleeping and hygiene facilities if drivers are not able to take a weekly rest at a private place of their choice; transport undertakings must organise the drivers' work in such a way that they are able to return to their home for a weekly rest at least once within three consecutive weeks; drivers may postpone the start of their weekly rest to reach their home provided that they comply with the daily and weekly driving time limits and with the required minimum duration of a weekly rest period; temporary exceptions from the general rules granted by Member States in urgent cases must be appropriately justified by the exceptional circumstances and the urgency involved in addressing them; Member States must inform the Commission about their national rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods applicable to the bus drivers exempted from the Regulation; national penalties imposed for infringing the Regulation should be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, as classified in relevant Union legislation. Tachygraph : the proposed amendments aim to improve the features of 'smart' tachographs to make it possible to more precisely position vehicles used for cross-border transport operations. The proposal adds an obligation on drivers to record in a tachograph the position of their vehicle after having crossed a border, at the earliest suitable stopping place."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: · powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) TFEU (delegated acts); · and on the other hand, powers conferred on the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts, as laid down in Article 291(2) TFEU (implementing acts). It is to necessary identify the powers conferred on the Commission by Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 and to classify them as delegated or implementing powers in accordance with Articles 290 and 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations, there was no need for an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to identify the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 and establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts. The Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of : (i) the establishment of the list of divisions per Member State, (ii) the determination of the threshold for the economic size and the number of returning holdings per division, (iii) the adoption of further rules on the qualification of returning holdings, (iv) the determination of the further content of the plan for the selection of returning holdings, (v) the adoption of further rules on the activities of Member States' National Committees for the data network, (vi) the adoption of further rules on the tasks of Member States' liaison agencies, and the adoption of rules on the accountancy data to be included in the farm return. Implementing powers will be conferred on the Commission in respect of the adoption of rules on the standard fee in the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Furthermore, for the sake of simplification and in the light of the experience gained with the application of Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 some of the provisions of that Regulation will be adapted or deleted. In particular, reports based on FADN data need no longer be submitted annually to the European Parliament and the Council for the annual fixing of prices of agricultural produce. The current provision that reports shall be submitted annually to the European Parliament and the Council is therefore obsolete. However, in order to provide convenient access to the data and reports based on FADN to other institutions as well as to the public such information should be published on a public website.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/25/EC regulates exhaust emissions from engines installed in agricultural or forestry tractors. The stage of emission limits currently applicable for type approval of the majority of compression ignition engines is referred to as Stage IIIA. The Directive provides that those limits will be replaced by the more stringent Stage IIIB limits, entering into force progressively as of 1st January 2010 as regards the type approval and as of 1st January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market of those engines. Directive 2004/26/EC amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery, provides that the Commission shall consider the available technology, including the cost-benefit, with a view to confirming stage IIIB and IV limit values and evaluating the possible need for additional flexibilities, exemptions or later introduction dates for certain types of equipment or engines and taking into account engines installed in non-road mobile machinery used in seasonal applications. Directive 2000/25/EC provides for a review clause in order to take into account the specificities of tractors of categories T2, T4.1 and C.2 (called narrow-track tractors, maximum width less than 1.15 m). Directive 97/68/EC was the subject of several technical studies. As a result of these technical studies carried out in 2007, 2009 and 2010, it was established that it is not technically feasible for tractors classified within the categories T2, C2 and T4.1 to meet the requirements of stages IIIB and IV already at the dates in the Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook a formal impact assessment in 2010, based on the previously mentioned technical studies and taking into account recent technological developments. The conclusion was that technical solutions are likely to be feasible, although not in the timeframe set in current legislation. A delay of 3 years for Stage IIIB and Stage IV requirements was assessed as the preferred option. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

BACKGROUND: this proposal concerns the recast of Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail transport statistics. The codification is carried out in the interests of clarity, given that the Regulation has been substantially amended several times. The new regulation will replace the various acts incorporated therein, whilst fully preserving its substance. CONTENT: the objective of this Regulation is to establish common rules for the production of rail transport statistics at Union level. Statistics on the transport of goods and passengers by rail are necessary: to enable the Commission to: (i) monitor and develop the common transport policy, as well as the transport elements of policies relating to the regions and to trans-European networks; (ii) monitor Union action in the field of transport safety; in order to fulfil the monitoring tasks provided for in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. Scope of the Regulation : this proposed Regulation shall cover all railways in the Union. Each Member State shall report statistics which relate to rail transport on its national territory. Where a railway undertaking operates in more than one Member State, the national authorities concerned shall require the undertaking to provide data separately for each country in which it operates so as to enable national statistics to be compiled. Member States may exclude from the scope of this Regulation: railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours; railway undertakings which mainly provide local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways. The annual statistics to be collected on the carriage of goods and passengers are set out in the Annexes to the Regulation. The proposal states that Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure the quality of the data transmitted. The quality of the statistical data shall be evaluated by Eurostat. By 31 December 2020 and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall report on the implementation of the Regulation and on future developments.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision No 1152/2003/EC is the founding decision for the computerised system (Excise Movement and Control System – EMCS). At the moment it covers only movements of excise goods under excise duty suspension. In order to allow the automation of the procedure for the movement of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State, Decision No 1152/2003/EC has to be modified. Since most provisions of the Decisions are affected by such modification, the Decision should be recast in the interests of clarity. This proposal accompanies the proposal for a Council Directive laying down the general arrangement for excise duty as regards the automation of the procedure for movements of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and that are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State. CONTENT: the objective of the proposal is to extend the excise movement and control system to intra EU movements of excise goods that are released for consumption, in order to simplify the procedure and allow for proper monitoring of such movements, and to provide a base for the governance of further automations of processes defined by Union excise legislation, where such automation is considered beneficial. It is proposed to amend most of the provisions of Decision No 1152/2003/EC so as to allow the possibility of automating any procedure used for the movement and control of excise goods. Specifically, the computerised system is intended to: permit the electronic transmission of the accompanying documents and the improvement of checks; improve the functioning of the internal market, by simplifying the intra-Union movement of excise goods and affording Member States the possibility of monitoring the flows in real time and of carrying out the requisite checks where necessary."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: transport is the only sector where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been on the rise. The GHG emissions from road transport are no exception. They represent almost 20% of total EU GHG emissions and have significantly increased since 1990. Air quality continues to be impacted by traffic and congestion, leading to increasing number of cities introducing low and zero-emission zones restricting local access for vehicles with internal combustion engines and to certain Member States announcing the phase-out of sales of internal combustion engine cars. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution, including road transport. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU to achieve the updated target for 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 by setting strengthened CO2 emission performance standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The proposal should ensure that CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles are reduced, provide benefits to consumers in term of air quality and energy savings, and strengthen the technological leadership of the EU automotive value chain. Additional co-benefits are expected to be increased energy efficiency and energy security. A combination of measures is required to tackle rising emissions in road transport to complement emissions trading. Stronger CO2 emissions standards for cars and vans will accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility. Under the proposal, average emissions of new cars should be reduced by 55% from 2030 and 100% from 2035 compared to 2021 levels. For new vans, the net reduction targets would be 50% and 100% respectively. To ensure that drivers are able to charge or fuel their vehicles at a reliable network across Europe, the revised Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation will require Member States to expand charging capacity in line with zero-emission car sales, and to install charging and fuelling points at regular intervals on major highways: every 60 kilometres for electric charging and every 150 kilometres for hydrogen refuelling. In addition, the proposal: - introduces derogations for certain manufacturers responsible for between 1 000 and 10 000 new passenger cars or between 1 000 and 22 000 new light commercial vehicles in a calendar year to apply for a derogation from the specific emission targets is removed from 2030 onwards. Manufacturers responsible for less than 1 000 new vehicle registrations per calendar year continue to be exempt; - sets out the obligation for the Commission to report on the progress towards zero-emission road mobility and assess the need for possible additional measures to facilitate the transition; - amends the Annexes with a view to: (i) adjusting the formulae for calculating the EU fleet-wide targets for 2030 and setting the formulae for 2035 as well as the annual specific emission targets for each manufacturer and removing the application of the zero- and low-emission vehicle (ZLEV) factor from 2030 onwards and; (ii) adjusting the formulae for determining the slope values required for calculating the annual specific emission targets. This adjustment is made in order to ensure a fair distribution of the reduction burden between manufacturers of lighter light commercial vehicles and those manufacturing heavier vehicles of that category."

1149EP8,"""""Seafarers""""",0.586,0.896,0.94,0.979,0.231,0.97,0.942,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend several European Directives in order to improve the level of information and consultation of seagoing workers in all Directives. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU labour law directives are generally applicable to all sectors of activity and all categories of workers. Nevertheless, seafarers are excluded or can be excluded from the scope of six directives, without any express justification. The directives concerned are the following: Directive 2008/94/EC relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer (hereafter referred to as ‘the Employer Insolvency Directive’); Directive 2009/38/EC on the establishment of European Works Council (hereafter referred to as the ‘European Works Council Directive’); Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees (hereafter referred to as the ‘Information and Consultation Directive’); Directive 98/59/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies (hereafter referred to as the ‘Collective Redundancies Directive’); Directive 2001/23/EC relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings (hereafter referred to as the ‘Transfer of Undertakings Directive’); Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (hereafter referred to as the ‘Posting of Workers Directive’). Depending on the situation at national level, exclusions could have a negative impact on a number of rights recognised under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to information and consultation within the undertaking and the right to fair and just working conditions. Most of the Member States have made little or no use of the exclusions which gives rise to a potential situation whereby the same categories of workers are treated differently in the different Member States. The number of EU national seafarers is steadily decreasing and this could be problematic for the future, notably because experience off-shore is essential for certain shore-based jobs. Although this could be the consequence of different factors, the lack of interest in maritime careers may be reinforced by the impression that seafarers are less well protected than other employees. As a consequence, the aim of the proposal is to improve the level of protection of the rights protected under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in EU labour law and to ensure a level playing field at EU level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the Directive to be amended, different options have been identified: suppression of the exclusions for the Insolvency Directive and for the European Works Council Directive; granting a derogation concerning the equivalent level of protection for the Information and Consultation Directive; including specific provisions for the Collective Redundancies Directive and for the Transfer of Undertakings Directive; As regards the Posting of Workers Directive, it was decided that no changes should be made. LEGAL BASIS: This proposal introduces amendments to five existing Directives: Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC. Three of these Directives were adopted with Article 153 TFEU (former Article 137 EC) as legal basis: 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC and 2008/94/EC. The legal bases of Directives 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC were respectively Articles 100 EC and 94 EC, i.e., equivalent to the current Article 115 TFEU. Despite the different legal bases of the Directives to be amended, having regard to their content, it is clear that they all serve to support and complement Member States' activities in the fields enumerated in Article 153(1) TFEU, in order to further the social policy objectives of the Union. Article 153(2) TFEU is therefore the adequate legal basis for a single proposal amending the abovementioned five Directives. CONTENT: this proposal introduces amendments to five Directives in force. The amending provisions may be summarised as follows : Right to information and consultation : the proposal recognises an unconditional right to information and consultation of seagoing workers in all Directives which previously allowed for exceptions and derogations from this right (European Works Councils Directive, Information and Consultation Directive, Collective Redundancies Directive, Transfer of Undertakings Directive). Principles : the proposal also recognises other rights, taking into account the specificity of the sector (suppression in some specific cases of cooling-off periods in the Collective Redundancies Directive or of the transfer of the employment contract/relationship in the Transfer of Undertakings Directive). Amendments to the Directives : a) reintroduction of seafarers into the scope of certain Directives : the deletion of Article 1(3), point (b) of Directive 2008/94/EC. This will suppress the possibility of excluding share-fishermen from the scope of the Insolvency Directive; suppression of Article 1(7) of Directive 2009/38/EC. Merchant navy crews will therefore be covered by the provisions of the European Works Council Directive. b) new rights : modifications to Article 3(3) of Directive 2002/14/EC in order to clarify that Member States are able to derogate from the general provisions of the Directive only where an equivalent level of protection and effective exercise by the employees concerned is ensured. c) collective redundancies : Directive 98/59/EC is amended as follows: insertion of the definition of ‘transfer’, by reference to Directive 2001/23/EC; deletion of Article 1(2)(c), thus putting the crews of seagoing vessels within the scope of the Collective Redundancies Directive; clarification that the notification provided for by Article 3(1) of the Directive should always be made to the competent authority of the State of the flag. This clarification is necessary because of the potential coexistence of employment contracts under different national laws; insertion of a new provision stating that Member States may grant the competent public authority the right to derogate, in part of in full, from the provisions on the ‘cooling-off’ period when the envisaged collective redundancy is carried out as a consequence of a transfer, having as its object exclusively one vessel or more vessels, or when the employer only operates one vessel. If Member States would like to make use of this derogation, they have to consult social partners when transposing this provision into their legislation. This amendment takes into account the characteristics of the maritime sector. It should be underlined that in the case of a sale consisting exclusively of one vessel or more, or in the case of an employer operating one vessel, the information and consultation obligation laid down in Article 2 continues to apply. The Directive remains fully applicable in all other circumstances where the collective dismissal of members of the crew of a vessel is envisaged. d) transfer of undertakings : current Article 1(3) of Directive 2001/23/EC is repealed. The Directive is made fully applicable to seagoing vessels registered in and/or flying the flag of a Member State, wherever they are situated. However, taking into account the specific characteristics of the maritime sector, Member States may, after consultation of social partners, derogate from the provisions of Chapter II of the Directive in the case of transfers concerning exclusively one seagoing vessel or a number of seagoing vessels, or the undertaking or business being transferred only operates one seagoing vessel. Consequently, in case of transfers concerning vessels exclusively or in the case of the undertaking only operating one vessel, at least the provisions of the Directive concerning information and consultation shall apply. Vessels are fully covered by the scope of the Directive when they constitute one of the assets being transferred. Non-regression clause : this clause aims at safeguarding the rights of workers covered by the scope of the proposal as recognised by the Member States before its entry into force. Review clause : the objective of the review is to monitor the implementation and application of Articles 4 and 5 of the Directive in the Member States, in particular on two issues: the phenomenon of flagging out, the level of employment of EU seafarers. Transition period : in order to take into account the differences between Member States regarding the nature of the maritime sector and the extent to which seafarers are included in the scope of national labour legislation, the proposal provides for a transition period of 5 years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the EU and Japan have a history of extensive political, economic and sectoral cooperation, which has evolved with time. Building on shared fundamental values, the EU established a Strategic Partnership with Japan in 2001. On 29 November 2012, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a framework agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Japan, of the other part. These negotiations began in April 2013 and were concluded in April 2018. Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Strategic Partnership Agreement, the Agreement was signed. The High Representative and the Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met and that the Agreement can be submitted for conclusion. The present joint proposal concerns the legal instrument concluding the Agreement. CONTENT: this draft Council Decision seeks to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Strategic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Japan, of the other part. This Agreement is the first-ever bilateral framework agreement between the EU and Japan. It will provide a legal foundation for improving bilateral cooperation and cooperation in international and regional organisations and fora. The Strategic Partnership Agreement and the Economic Partnership Agreement are part of one negotiating context and have a clear legal link.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council constituted the Union regulatory framework for the manufacture, authorisation and distribution of veterinary medicinal products. In the light of the experience acquired and following the assessment by the Commission of the functioning of the internal market for veterinary medicinal products, the Commission has presented a proposal that will repeal and replace Directive 2001/82/EC on veterinary medicinal products. This proposal lays down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to take account of the fact that centralised marketing authorisation for veterinary products is being decoupled from that for medicines for humans. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commission’s Impact Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 so as to: delete from Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the provisions regarding granting and maintaining marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products . The rules on marketing authorisations valid in all EU Member States are part of the proposal for a Regulation on veterinary medicinal products. The new Regulation on veterinary medicinal products will cover all routes granting marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products in the Union – both at centralised and national level; establish certain principles applicable to fees payable to the Agency , including the need to take into account, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisions regulating fees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon; align the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to Articles 290 and 291 (delegated and implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU. As set out in the legislative financial statement the additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of implementing acts. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements concluded on 30 June 2005 under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law makes a valuable contribution to promoting party autonomy in international commercial transactions and increasing the predictability of judicial solutions in such transactions. In particular, the Convention ensures the necessary legal certainty for the parties that their choice of court agreement is respected and that a judgment given by the chosen court is eligible for recognition and enforcement in cross-border situations. Article 29 of the Convention allows Regional Economic Organisations such us the European Union to sign, accept, approve or accede to the Convention. The Convention affects Union secondary legislation on jurisdiction based on choice by the parties and the recognition and enforcement of the resulting judgments, in particular Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I Regulation) (to be replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 as of 10 January 2015), it is in the interests of the European Union to approve the Hague Convention so that it enters into force on the same date of the entry into application of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012. Moreover, the Union, should, when approving the Convention, make the declaration allowed under Article 21 excluding from the scope of the Convention insurance contracts in general, subject to defined exceptions in order to preserve the protective jurisdictional rules available to the policyholder, the insured party or a beneficiary in insurance contracts under Section 3 of Regulation (EC) 44/2001. The exclusion should be limited to whatever is necessary to protect the interests of the weaker parties in insurance contracts. The Convention was signed by the Union on 1 April 2009 on the basis of the Council Decision 2009/397/EC. It is now necessary to approve the Convention on behalf of the EU. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2), in conjunction with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 218(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is requested to adopt a decision to approve, on behalf of the EU, the 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. Having the EU approve the Convention would reduce legal uncertainty for EU companies trading outside the EU by ensuring that choice of court agreements included in their contracts are respected and that judgments issued by the courts designated in such agreements would be eligible for recognition and enforcement in the other Contracting Parties to the Convention. Overall, approval of the Convention by the EU would complement the realisation of the aims underlying the EU rules on the prorogation of jurisdiction, by creating a harmonised set of rules within the EU in respect of third states which will become Contracting Parties to the Convention. The Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements: the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements is designed to offer greater legal certainty and predictability for parties involved in business-to-business agreements and international litigation by creating an optional worldwide judicial dispute resolution mechanism alternative to the existing arbitration system. In particular, the objective of the Convention is to promote international trade and investment through enhanced judicial cooperation by introducing uniform rules on jurisdiction based on exclusive choice of court agreements and on the recognition and enforcement of judgments given by the chosen courts in its Contracting Parties. The Convention seeks to achieve a balance between: (i) the need to guarantee to the parties that only the courts chosen by them will hear the case and that the resulting judgment will be recognised and enforced abroad, and (ii) the need to allow States to pursue some aspects of their public policy, related in particular to the protection of weaker parties, protection against serious unfairness in particular situations and guaranteed respect for some grounds of exclusive jurisdiction of States. How the Convention relates to the Brussels I Regulation: the Convention affects the application of the Brussels I Regulation if at least one of the parties is resident in a Contracting State to the Convention. The Convention will prevail over the jurisdiction rules of the Regulation except if both parties are EU residents or come from third states, not Contracting Parties to the Convention. The Convention will give EU business the necessary legal certainty that their choice of court agreements in favour of a court outside the EU are respected in the EU, and that agreements in favour of a court in the EU are respected in third States. It will also ensure that EU businesses can be confident that a judgment given by the chosen court in the EU is eligible for recognition and enforcement in third states, Contracting Parties to the Convention, and vice versa. Declaration on insurance contracts: the Brussels I Regulation (Section 3) provides for special protective jurisdiction in matters of insurance aimed at protecting the weaker party (the policyholder, the insured party or a beneficiary) and the economic interests of the general public of the place where the weaker party is located. The insured party, as plaintiff, therefore has a choice of suing the insurer at several places, including the place where the insured party is domiciled; the insurer, as plaintiff, can sue the insured party in principle only where the latter is domiciled. These protective jurisdiction rules are based on the premise that the insured party is always the weaker party, even if he acts as a commercial operator in B2B relations. There is no change to this presumption in the Brussels I Regulation (recast). For this reason, the possibility of the parties concluding the choice of court agreement has been limited (Article 13 of the Regulation). The Convention on its part applies to insurance matters without limiting party autonomy to conclude choice of court agreements. The only substantive limitation results from Article 2(1)(a) of the Convention which excludes insurance contracts entered into by private persons as consumers. This is partially contrary to the regime established in the Brussels I Regulation insofar as, for instance, the Convention would apply to insurance contracts concluded by SMEs. Once the Convention is approved by the EU, certain insurance contracts which now fall under the Brussels I Regulation, e.g. contracts between an EU policyholder and the EU branch of an insurer with headquarters outside the EU (Article 9(2) of the Regulation) would fall within the scope of the Convention (Article 26(6), in conjunction with Article 4(2) of the Convention). Therefore, if the Convention were to be concluded without excluding insurance contracts, there would be a lack of parallelism with the protective policy established in the Brussels I Regulation which allows the insured party to sue an EU insurer (or a EU branch of third State insurer) in his own place of domicile irrespective of any other jurisdiction available under a choice of court agreement. Other technical provisions have been included for the EU to exclude certain types of insurance matters falling within the scope of the Convention, without laying down additional conditions. The carve-out is as small as is needed to achieve the goal of protecting the interests of weaker parties in insurance contracts as reflected in the protective jurisdiction rules of the Brussels I Regulation."

BACKGROUND: on 10 September 2010, the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China with a view to reaching a broad and ambitious agreement on cooperation on geographical indications and their protection. The conclusion of the Agreement is part of the EU’s overall strategy to promote the EU’s policy on geographical indications. The initiative aims to provide a high level of protection, at least at the level provided for in Article 23 of the TRIPS+ Agreement, for a range of EU GIs to be protected in the People's Republic of China and Chinese GIs to be protected in the EU.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Moldova is one of the countries in the European Union's eastern neighbourhood most heavily affected by the global crisis. Despite high average economic growth rates in the years leading up to the crisis, Moldova's income level per capita remains by far the lowest in the region. The policy response to the economic crisis was delayed first by the preparation for parliamentary elections in Spring 2009 and later by internal political tensions over the election results. The repeat elections that had to be organised in the Autumn of 2009 brought a coalition government into power on a reform agenda that seeks closer approximation to the EU and aims at turning around the previous growth model which relies heavily on the inflow of remittances. These political developments have created a new momentum in the scaling up of bilateral relations with the EU, culminating in the opening of formal negotiations on a new Association Agreement on 12 January 2010. In parallel, the new Prime Minister formally requested EU financial support, which is the subject of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: macro-financial assistance will have an immediate impact on the balance of payments and the State budget of the Republic of Moldova and will in this way contribute to the alleviation of financial constraints on the implementation of the authorities' economic programme. Macro-financial assistance will further support the general objectives of the stabilisation programme agreed with the IMF. European Union assistance will also support the authorities' efforts to implement short-and medium-term policies identified in the EU-Republic of Moldova Action Plan agreed in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to provide to the Republic of Moldova macro-financial assistance (MFA) in the form of a grant of up to EUR 90 million. The proposed assistance is intended to contribute to covering Moldova's general balance-of-payments needs and the financing needs of the State budget identified by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It will support the authorities' stabilisation programme with a view to ensuring sustainable fiscal and external accounts, and will thus help the country address the consequences of the global financial crisis. The proposed European Union macro-financial assistance will complement support from the IMF foreseen under the financing arrangement agreed by the IMF board on 29 January 2010. EU MFA is aimed at contributing to covering the country's external financing needs in 2010 and 2011. The proposed assistance will also strengthen the reform momentum in Moldova in supporting the government's economic programme and its efforts towards integration with the EU. It will also contribute to the implementation of the European Union's cooperation strategy towards Moldova and, more generally, towards the countries of the Eastern Partnership. EU MFA will be exceptional and limited in time, and will be conditional on progress in the implementation of the current IMF programme and on the successful fulfilment of economic policy conditions that will be attached to this assistance. Management of assistance : the assistance will be made available in three or four instalments: in principle, two instalments in 2010 and one or two instalments in 2011. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. The Commission will agree with the authorities the specific economic policy and financial conditions attached to the payment of each instalment. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be included as necessary. Provisions are also provided as regards the definition of technical conditions as well as monitoring and evaluation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION:t he assistance will be financed from commitment appropriations in 2010 and 2011 under budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance); the payments will also take place in 2010 and 2011."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters seeks to simplify the method of transmission of judicial and extrajudicial documents between the Contracting States. It thus facilitates judicial cooperation in cross-border civil and commercial litigation. The EU in its external relations has been promoting the accession of third countries to the Hague Service Convention. The Hague Service Convention is not open to participation by regional organisations. As a result, the European Union is not in a position to accede to the Convention. Given that the Hague Service Convention is important for the European Union interests, the Council should authorise the Member States which had not concluded the Hague Service Convention before adoption of the Union measures to accede to the Convention in the interest of the European Union, subject to certain conditions. The Member States to which this decision is addressed are Austria and Malta. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2) and 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal for a Council Decision, Austria and Malta would accede to the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters in the interest of the European Union. Purpose of the Convention: the Convention indicates the channels to be used for the transmission from one Contracting State to another in the event of service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial act. The main channel of transmission, in lieu of consular and diplomatic channels, is through a Central Authority, who shall serve the documents or shall arrange to have them served. The Convention also provides for several other modes of transmission (for example, by post). It seeks to establish a system which, as far as possible, brings actual notice of the document to be served to the recipient in sufficient time to enable him to defend himself. Lastly, the Convention facilitates proof that the service has been affected abroad, by means of certificates contained in a uniform model. EU competences: this field falls into the exclusive external competence of the European Union, because of the adoption of internal Union legislation by means of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. As a result, Member States cannot sign this Convention without being authorised to do so. 24 Member States were Parties to the Convention before the EU legislation was adopted. Austria and Malta remain to be authorised to accede to the Convention. The Commission therefore proposes that the Council authorises Austria and Malta to accede to the Convention in the interest of the European Union. The Convention does not contain any provisions allowing the European Union itself to accede to the Convention. Declarations of the Contracting States: the Convention provides for a possibility for the Contracting States to make declarations with regard to a number of its provisions. The EU Member States, Contracting States to the Convention, entered various declarations. The situation is not uniform, however. Against this backdrop, it is not reasonable to require the Member States concerned to make uniform declaration(s), if any. In conclusion, Austria and Malta should, when acceding to the Convention, make all appropriate declarations allowed under its provisions that they deem necessary. The text of such declarations should be attached to the Council decision. Entry into force: Austria and Malta will take the necessary measures to deposit their instruments of accession before 31 December 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in December 2010, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 (""2010 pharmacovigilance legislation"") amending respectively, as regards pharmacovigilance, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The new legislation will apply from July 2012. These measures have substantially strengthened the legal framework for the surveillance of medicinal products, with provisions to reinforce the coordinating role of the Agency, the possibilities for signal detection, and the operation of coordinated procedures at European level to respond to safety concerns. However, recent pharmacovigilance events in the European Union, in particular the “Mediatorcase”, have shown the need for a further improvement of the pharmacovigilance system. Following an analysis of the Mediator case in the light of the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation (""Stress test""), the Commission has detected certain weaknesses in the pharmacovigilance system that need to be addressed. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal to amend Directive 2001/83/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 and Article 168(4)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the general policy objectives of the proposals to amend Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medicinal products for human use and to protect better the health of EU citizens. Following this line, the proposals aim specifically to address weaknesses identified in the EU pharmacovigilance system and provide for more transparency and efficiency of the system in cases where safety concerns are identified. The main amendments to the Regulation are as follows: Reasons for withdrawal : marketing authorisation holders are not required to declare the reasons for the withdrawal of a marketing authorisation or product. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that voluntary withdrawal of a marketing authorisation or product by the marketing authorisation holder could lead to safety issues being missed, in particular if the company is not transparent about possible safety concerns. Accordingly, provision is made for the marketing authorisation holder to inform the Agency of the reasons for the withdrawal of a medicinal product, for interrupting the placing on the market of a medicinal product, for requests for revoking a marketing authorisation, or for not renewing a marketing authorisation. Transparency : the public list of medicinal product subject to additional monitoring provided for in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will include certain medicinal products subject to post-authorisation safety conditions. Those products will be included in the list, following consultation with the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, only if the Commission or a Member States' competent authorities make a request. Therefore, competent authorities will have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to make public the fact that products are subject to strengthened surveillance. The proposal provides that, in order to ensure transparency on the surveillance of authorised medicinal products, the list of medicinal products subject to additional monitoring established by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should systematically include medicinal products that are subject to post-authorisation safety conditions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the budget of the Union. It makes minor changes to the system set forth by the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation, and does not require additional human or administrative resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the strong growth in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the aviation sector risks undermining the EU's and global efforts to effectively tackle climate change. A centrepiece of the 2030 framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically below 1990 levels by 2030. The Union and its Member States have been endeavouring to advance international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas impacts from aviation since 1997 and they have legislation in place since 2008 to limit the climate change impacts from aviation activities through the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) that has been operating since 2005. In order to advance progress at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Union has twice adopted time-bound derogations to Directive 2003/87/EC on the EU ETS so as to limit compliance obligations to emissions from flights between aerodromes situated in the European Economic Area (EEA). In October 2016, ICAO agreed at its 39th Assembly on a Resolution for a global market-based measure (GMBM) to address the growth in international aviation emissions globally from 2021 through an offsetting system, aimed at enabling the aspiration goal of stabilising international aviation emissions at 2020 levels. In the absence of amendment to the existing legislation, the initial scope of the ETS (i.e. including extra EEA flights) would apply again. In view of the agreement on the GMBM at ICAO, the EU support towards its completion and timely operationalisation, and the EU's intended implementation of the GMBM from 2021 onwards, it is deemed necessary to review the EU ETS legislation. CONTENT: in response to the progress achieved by the 39th ICAO Assembly and to promote further momentum towards the successful implementation of a global market-based measure to address international aviation emissions from 2021, the Commission proposed to amend Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading (EU ETS). Scope of the application of the EU ETS : it is proposed to extend the current approach to application of the EU ETS as set out in Regulation No. 421/2014 beyond 2016 until there will be sufficient clarity about the nature and content of the legal instruments adopted by ICAO for the implementation of the global market-based measure to allow the European Commission to carry out further assessments and review the EU ETS for the post-2020 period. Following the same approach as under Regulation (EU) No 421/2014 for the 2013-2016 period, the application of the EU ETS Directive to flights to and from outermost regions and third countries is derogated from after 2016, while flights between aerodromes in the EEA remain fully covered. Given that the scope remains as in 2016, the amount of free allocation received by aircraft operators will continue to be the same as in 2016 so, proportional to the intra-EEA activity, and the linear reduction factor applicable to all sectors under the EU ETS Directive will apply but only from 2021 onwards. Prepare for the implementation of a global market-based measure from 2021 : the proposal introduced a new provision that requires the Commission to report to the European Parliament and the Council on international developments of relevance for the implementation of the global market-based measure as well as on the actions taken by third countries to implement the measure. Thereby, the Commission is to consider ways to implement the relevant ICAO instruments in Union law through a revision of the EU ETS Directive. This may be accompanied with legislative proposals as appropriate. Annex I : Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC is amended by extending the exemption for non-commercial aircraft operators emitting less than 1 000 tonnes CO2 per annum from 2020 until 2030. The exemption reduced the number of aircraft operators regulated by Member States by around 2200 representing only 0.2% of emissions. Delegated acts : in order to prepare for the implementation of the global market-based measure, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to provide for the appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions applicable to aircraft operators for the purpose of implementing the global market-based measure being elaborated in ICAO."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: as part of the measures to regulate fisheries of bluefin tuna, improve the quality and reliability of statistical data and prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopted at its annual meeting in Marrakesh (Morocco) on 24 November 2008, Recommendation No 08-12 amending Recommendation No 07-10 on a bluefin tuna catch documentation programme. This Recommendation entered into force on 17 June 2009. The proposal aims to establish a Community bluefin tuna catch documentation programme in order to support the implementation of conservation and management measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Member States shall require a completed bluefin tuna catch document for each bluefin tuna landed at its ports, delivered to, and harvested from its farms. Each consignment of bluefin tuna domestically traded, imported into or exported or re-exported from the territory of the Community shall be accompanied by a validated catch document, except in certain cases involving tagging as specified in the text, and, as applicable, an ICCAT transfer declaration or a validated bluefin tuna re-export certificate. Any such landing, transfer, delivery, harvest, domestic trade, import, export or re-export of bluefin tuna without a completed and validated catch document or a re-export certificate shall be prohibited. The proposal states also that Member States shall ensure that each bluefin tuna consignment which is re-exported from their territory be accompanied by a validated re-export certificate. However, in cases where farmed bluefin tuna is imported live, the re-export certificate shall not apply. The proposal contains provisions on validation and tagging as well as on communication and verification of documentation and transmission of data. The current ICCAT bluefin tuna statistical programme, which only covers import and export, was not designed to provide a mechanism to offer direct control on bluefin tuna fisheries. In order to ensure that the provisions in the ICCAT bluefin tuna catch documentation programme are applied uniformly, the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1984/2003 introducing a system for the statistical monitoring of trade in bluefin tuna, swordfish and bigeye tuna within the Community must be repealed and replaced by this draft Regulation."

The measures taken so far have not effectively solved the main problems of the fishery, these being: Due to deep-sea stocks' high vulnerability to fishing, stock depletion can occur within a short period of time, and recovery might take very long or fail. The stocks' biological state is largely unknown. Some are considered depleted, others have started to stabilise at low levels of exploitation. In general the fisheries are not sustainable. A new regulation is required in order to deal with these problems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of impacts resulting from different policy choices focussed on five options. Three of these were not considered further because they were considered not representing meaningful management approaches, with disadvantages largely outweighing advantages, namely: (i) to continue the current regime amending it only by needed updates; (ii) to ban fishing for deep-sea species altogether, and (iii) to scale the regime down to being a tool for transposing measures adopted in NEAFC and applying those measures also in Union waters. The two options with relative advantage were: (iv) to phase out the most harmful fishing gears targeting deep-sea species, or (v) to introduce in Union waters management standards that were developed for bottom fishing on the High Sea. Option (iv) was retained as being a more effective and simpler instrument. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes a framework Regulation for exercising fishing activity targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantics, comprising Union waters including outermost regions of Spain and Portugal, and international waters. The objectives of this Regulation are the following: ·  to ensure the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea species while minimising the impact of deep-sea fishing activities on the marine environment; ·  to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats for these purposes; ·  to implement technical measures on fisheries management recommended by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Ensure sustainable exploitation : the general objective of the proposal is to ensure as much as possible the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea stocks while reducing the environmental impact of these fisheries, and to improve the information base for scientific assessment. As long as data and method have not achieved the required level allowing MSY-based management, the fisheries have to be managed according to the precautionary approach to fisheries management. Protect marine ecosystems : in order to reduce the destructive impact on the marine ecosystem, the use of bottom trawls should be phased out in this fishery, as they are most harmful to vulnerable marine ecosystems and have shown high levels of undesired catch of deep-sea species. The transitional restrictions on bottom-set gillnets in fisheries below 600m depth and in the depth-range 200-600m should be accompanied by a prohibition to target deep-sea species. Simplifying the management system for these stocks : the proposal also considers the opportunity to simplify the management system for these stocks, currently subject to a double instrument: catch limitations and capacity/effort limitation. Where this duplication is not necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, proposals are made to regulate the concerned fisheries with only one management instrument. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union is still faced with many challenges such as the insufficient or inconsistent implementation of certain rights across the Union or a lack of awareness about certain Union legislation both by citizens and public authorities. Legislative and policy measures as well as their coherent implementation are key tools. Funding can contribute to the development of this area through supporting legislation and policy-making and promoting their implementation. In accordance with the Communication on the EU Budget Review, a fresh look was taken at the existing funding instruments and delivery mechanisms to ensure clear focus on European added value and to cater for rationalisation and simplification of the funding mechanisms. In ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’, the Commission identified the need for a simpler and more transparent budget to overcome the problems that arise from the complexity of programme structures and the existence of multiple programmes. The area of Rights was mentioned as an example of the existing fragmentation, where action should be taken. Within this framework and aiming at simplification and rationalisation, the Rights and Citizenship Programme is the successor of three current programmes: Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Daphne III, The Sections ""Antidiscrimination and Diversity"" and ""Gender Equality"" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS). The merge of these programmes will allow for a comprehensive funding approach in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: one impact assessment was carried out concerning the future funding activities for the whole area of justice, rights and equality, which currently comprises six programmes ( Civil Justice Programme, the Criminal Justice Programme, the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme, the Daphne III Programme, the Drug Prevention and Information Programme and the sections ""Antidiscrimination and Diversity"" and ""Gender Equality"" of the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity ( PROGRESS )). The impact assessment has considered three options: Option A: to maintain six programmes and to address some of the identified problems through changes in the internal management of the programmes.; Option B: to maintain all measures of option A and additionally to merge the current six programmes into two programmes. This option would allow for flexibility in the use of funds and in addressing annual policy priorities. It would achieve increased simplification (both for the beneficiaries and the administration) and efficiency of the programmes, since significantly fewer procedures would be needed. The effectiveness of the programmes would also be improved as the fragmentation and dilution of funds would be addressed better within two programmes. Human resources could be freed, since fewer procedures would reduce the administrative burden and they would be allocated to activities improving the effectiveness of the programmes (dissemination of results, monitoring, providing information, etc). Option C: to implement only one programme. This option addresses all problems caused by the multiple legal instruments and by the increased administrative burden of managing multiple programmes. However, due to legal constraints the scope of this programme would not be able to cover the funding needs of all policy areas. A choice would have to be made between the area of justice and the area of rights and citizenship. Although this solution can deliver maximum impact in terms of management, however it would not be possible to address sufficiently the policy priorities and needs of the whole policy area. Resulting from the analysis and comparison of the options, the preferred option is the implementation of two programmes which would cover the funding needs of all policy areas (option B). In comparison to the status quo option B presents clear advantages and no disadvantage. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 19(2), 21(2), 114, 168, 169 and 197 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, the Commission proposes to establish a new European Union Programme on Rights and Citizenship for 2014-2020. General objective : the general objective of the Programme shall be to contribute to the creation of an area, where the rights of persons, as enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, are promoted and protected. Specific objectives : to achieve the general objective, the Programme shall have the following specific objectives: to contribute to enhancing the exercise of rights deriving from the citizenship of the Union; to promote the effective implementation of the principles of non discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, including equality between women and men and the rights of persons with disabilities and of the elderly; to contribute to ensuring a high level of protection of personal data; to enhance the respect of the rights of the child; to empower consumers and businesses to trade and purchase in trust within the internal market by enforcing the rights deriving from the Union consumer legislation and by supporting the freedom to conduct business in the internal market through cross-border transactions. The indicators to measure the achievement of the objectives shall be, inter alia, the European perception of the respect, exercise and implementation of these rights and the number of complaints. Actions financed : the Programme shall finance inter alia the following types of actions: analytical activities , such as collection of data and statistics; development of common methodologies and, where appropriate, indicators or benchmarks; studies, researches, analyses and surveys; evaluations and impact assessments; training activities , such as staff exchanges, workshops, seminars, train-the-trainers events; mutual learning, cooperation, awareness raising and dissemination activities , such as identification of, and exchanges on, good practices, innovative approaches and experiences, organisation of peer review and mutual learning; support for main actors , such as support for Member States when implementing Union law and policies; support for key European level networks whose activities are linked to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme; funding of experts' networks; funding of European level observatories. European added value : the Commission shall ensure that the actions selected for funding are intended to produce results with European added value and shall monitor whether European added value was actually achieved through the final results of the actions financed by the Programme. Implementation : in implementing this Regulation the Commission will establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. The Programme can make use of all financial instruments foreseen in the Financial Regulation. The Commission may use, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, an existing executive agency for the implementation of the programme, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes. The programme may share resources with other Union instruments, in particular the Justice programme, in order to implement actions meeting the objectives of both programmes.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Ukraine relations continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. An Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine, providing for a deep and comprehensive free trade area, entered into force on 1 September 2017. Since spring 2014, Ukraine has been carrying out an ambitious reform programme aimed at stabilising its economy and improving the living conditions of its population. The fight against corruption as well as constitutional, electoral and judicial reforms are among the main priorities. The implementation of these reforms has been supported by five consecutive macro-financial assistance programmes, under which Ukraine has received loans totalling EUR 5 billion over the period 2014-2021. In order to allow for greater policy flexibility in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement with Ukraine in June 2020 for an amount equivalent to USD 5 billion. The Ukrainian economy has been affected by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the persistent security threats on the country's border with Russia. Inflation accelerated and reached 10% by the end of 2021. The worsening geopolitical tensions on Ukraine's border with Russia have had a profound impact on confidence, particularly among foreign investors. According to the latest IMF projections, the lack of access to capital markets is expected to widen the country's funding gap by at least USD 2.5 billion in 2022 and significantly increase risks to the country's macroeconomic outlook. It is against this background of increased geopolitical uncertainty, which prevents Ukraine from accessing international capital markets and affects its economic situation, that the Commission is presenting a proposal to provide Ukraine with new MFA in the form of loans to foster stability in the country. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the EU makes available to Ukraine macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 1.2 billion with a view to facilitating macroeconomic stabilisation and the implementation of a comprehensive reform programme. The planned emergency MFA, put forward to provide swift support in a situation of acute crisis and to strengthen the resilience of the country, will have a duration of 12 months and include two disbursements: - the release of the first tranche, subject to the political precondition and a satisfactory implementation of the IMF programme, would occur swiftly after the approval of this proposal, upon entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on specific structural policy measures, agreed between the European Commission on behalf of the EU and Ukraine; - the disbursement of the second tranche would be linked to the continuous satisfactory implementation of both an IMF programme and the policy measures agreed in the MoU. The MoU underpinning this emergency macro-financial assistance operation is likely to focus on a limited number of feasible, short-term policy actions in the most urgent priority areas, such as strengthening economic resilience and stability, governance and rule of law, and energy. The implementation of the proposed operation is expected to go hand-in-hand with the support under budgetary operations financed by the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The announced additional allocation of EUR 120 million in NDICI grants will be important to further strengthen Ukraine’s state-building and resilience efforts. A pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems and promote structural reforms aimed at supporting sustainable and inclusive growth, decent employment creation and fiscal consolidation. Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service. In order for the European Parliament and the Council to follow the implementation of this decision, the Commission will have to inform them regularly on developments related to the assistance. Budgetary implications The proposed macro-financial assistance operation in favour of Ukraine would be disbursed in two equal instalments, to be disbursed over 12 months. These funds will be borrowed on the capital market and then lent to Ukraine. The loan will benefit from the external action guarantee. The required provisioning (corresponding to 9% of the loan amount) will be provided under the Neighbourhood, Development Cooperation and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 108 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use provides for a harmonised framework on advertising of medicines at Community level, the application of which remains a responsibility of Member States. This legislation prohibits the advertising to the general public of medicines subject to prescription. However, neither the Directive nor Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 include detailed provisions on information on medicinal products, providing only that certain information supply activities are exempted from the advertising provisions. Therefore, Community legislation does not prevent Member States from establishing their own approaches regarding the provision of information on medicinal products as long as the above mentioned rules on advertising are respected. In addition, the boundaries between advertising and information, and therefore the field of application of the legislation's restrictions on advertising, are not interpreted consistently across the Community. Pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC, a Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council concerning the ""Report on current practices with regard to the provision of information to patients on medicinal products"" (see COD/1999/0134 under “Follow-up documents”) was adopted and submitted to the European Parliament and the Council on 20 December 2007. According to the Report, rules and practices on what information can be made available vary significantly among Member States. Moreover, divergences in terms of rules and practices on what information can be made available have a negative impact on legal certainty for marketing authorisation holders with cross-border activity. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (see also COD/2008/0256) to address the gap in the current pharmaceutical legislation as regards the provision of information to the general public on prescription-only medicinal product for human use. The aim is to enhance the rational use of these medicines, while ensuring that the legislative framework continues to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines. The main elements of the proposals can be summarised as follows: clarifying that the provision of information on prescription-only medicines directly to the public by marketing authorisation holders is allowed, without prejudice to the prohibition on advertising, provided that clearly defined conditions are fulfilled; establishing harmonised conditions on the content of information which marketing authorisation holders are allowed to disseminate (information approved by the competent authorities for granting marketing authorisation, whether used literally or presented in a different way, and other limited medicine-related information); establishing harmonised quality standards for such information, to ensure that it is of high-quality and non-promotional; determining the authorised channels of information provision, in order to exclude unsolicited means of dissemination; introducing the obligation for Member States to establish a monitoring system to ensure that the abovementioned provisions on content of information, quality standards and dissemination channels are complied with and ensure enforcement in case of non-compliance. The proposal leaves it up to the Member States to decide the most appropriate monitoring mechanisms, but lays down a general rule that monitoring should take place after dissemination of information, with certain exceptions (where prior approval would be necessary) in the case of certain modalities of information where the distinction between advertising and non-promotional information is more difficult to establish. For products authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, certain approval tasks are given to the European Medicines Agency; establishing specific monitoring rules for information disseminated through websites, to take account of the cross-border nature of information provided over the Internet and to allow Member State cooperation and avoid duplication of monitoring."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Council and of the Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : Union rules on novel foods were set out in Regulation (EC) n° 258/97 of the European Parliament and Council and Commission Regulation (EC) n° 1852/2001. Those rules need to be updated to simplify the current authorisation procedures and to take account of recent developments in Union law. In January 2008, the Commission adopted a proposal aiming to simplify the authorization procedure set out in Regulation (EC) 258/97 on novel foods. The legislative discussions under the ordinary legislative procedure mainly focused on the provisions applicable to: (i) nanomaterials; (ii) the cloning of animals for food production; (iii) traditional foods from third countries; (iv) the criteria to be examined for the risk assessment, and (v) risk management and to the procedure for the authorisation of novel foods in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Lisbon Treaty). However, the proposal was not adopted after the Conciliation Committee failed to reach an agreement in March 2011. The Commission considers that issues related to cloning of farm animals should be addressed in a separate proposal, based on an impact assessment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the 2008 impact assessment is still valid, and the rationale for an in-depth revision of the current legislation remains unchanged (the length and cost of the current authorisation procedure, the need for a centralised risk assessment and risk management and for an adjusted procedure for the placing on the EU market of traditional foods from third countries). CONTENT : the proposal brings together and updates the provisions of the legislation currently in force, which will be repealed at the time of entry into application of the new legislation. It aims to streamline the authorisation procedure for novel foods, to improve its efficiency and transparency. It is limited to the safety of novel food and is based on the overall agreement achieved in conciliation. The main points are as follows: Subject matter, scope and definitions · novel foods will be subject to safety evaluation and authorisation through a fully harmonised procedure; · the definition of novel foods is clarified, bearing in mind new technologies which have an impact on food. · a simplified procedure is created for marketing of traditional foods from third countries; · nanomaterials which are intended for food uses and covered by the definition of ""engineered nanomaterials"", as laid down in Regulation (EU) n°1169/2011 on food information to consumers, shall be assessed and authorised under this Regulation before being placed on the EU market. Requirements for placing novel foods on the market within the Union: · all novel foods and their use must not present a danger to human health and their use should not mislead the consumer; · for every authorised novel food, specifications, labelling requirements, conditions of use and, where appropriate, a requirement of post-market monitoring may be laid down; · the current system of individual authorisations is replaced by a system of generic authorisation; · novel foods already authorised shall continue to be marketed and will be included in the Union list of novel foods. Authorisation procedure for a novel food · all applications for the authorisation of novel foods shall be submitted to the Commission which may then request a scientific opinion on risk assessment from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA); · the inclusion of a novel food in the Union list of novel foods will be considered by the Commission on the basis of the opinion from EFSA. For traditional foods from third countries, a safety assessment and a risk management, based on a history of safe food use, is introduced: · if the applicant has shown a history of safe food use in a third country for at least 25 years, and if the Member States or EFSA do not present reasoned safety objections based on scientific evidence, the food may be included in the Union list; · where reasoned safety objections are presented, an EFSA assessment followed by an EU authorisation procedure, similar to the standard authorisation procedure but with shorter deadlines, is required. Additional procedural rules and other requirements · the information provided by the applicant should be kept confidential where the disclosure of such information might significantly harm their competitive position. Data protection · in order to support innovation in the EU food industry and only in duly justified cases, individual authorisations with data protection may be granted for a maximum period of five years. Penalties and committee procedure · rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of the proposed Regulation will be laid down; · implementation of the measures proposed in the Regulation will be mainly adopted by the Commission. This relates to the conditions of use and labelling of a novel food as well as laying down specifications and, where appropriate post-market monitoring requirements. Transitional provisions · transitional measures are set out to ensure a smooth transition with on-going applications and notifications, pending the entry into application of this legislation; · to enhance legal certainty, a food that was legally placed on the market prior to the application of this Regulation, should be allowed to be continued to be marketed until the risk assessment and authorisation procedures have been concluded. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : operational resources necessary for implementation of the proposal will be covered by redeployment within the contribution granted to EFSA during the annual budgetary procedure. The estimated impact on appropriations of an administrative nature is EUR 2.750 million for the period 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal notes that currently, Article 7(2) of the ERDF Regulation provides for the eligibility of expenditure on housing in the new Member States. The experience to-date, however, proves that the conditions of eligibility do not fully fit the needs on the ground. Under the current ERDF provisions, housing interventions can take place in the framework of urban development operations and in the form of renovation of existing houses. Therefore, support for housing interventions in rural areas or for the replacement of “houses” of a very poor quality in urban or rural areas cannot be eligible under the ERDF. The European Parliament and the Council have repeatedly asked the Commission to take action to promote inclusion of communities facing extreme deprivation and marginalisation, with particular reference to the Roma community. This proposal aims to remedy the situation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the present proposal permits the ERDF financial support for housing interventions in cases where marginalised communities living conditions are extremely poor and social exclusion is high. This could not be possible without modification of the existing regulatory framework. CONTENT: the proposal states that allocations shall be made available also for housing interventions in favour of communities currently ineligible under the ERDF, i.e. for i) housing interventions not limited to the urban areas and ii) housing interventions consisting of the replacement of houses of extremely poor quality, irrespectively of the area (“urban” or “rural”). Expenditure shall be limited to one of the following interventions: renovation of the common parts in existing multi-family housing, renovation and change of use of existing buildings owned by public authorities or non-profit operators for use as housing designated for low-income households or people with special needs. Interventions may include the replacement of existing housing by newly constructed houses. Furthermore, the amended Article 7(2) of the ERDF Regulation confers the Commission implementing powers for the definition of the criteria for the selection of areas and of the list of eligible housing interventions. The proposal notes that in order to avoid unjustified discriminations, the guiding principle of the proposed interventions should be the 2nd Basic Principle on Roma Inclusion according to which interventions focusing on Roma people as target group should not exclude other people sharing similar socio-economic circumstances. Moreover, housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities characterised by extreme deprivation are only part of a complex issue. They should be tackled in the framework of a multi-dimensional integrated approach, to be defined at national level, with strong partnerships and taking on board aspects relating to education, social affairs, integration, culture, health, employment, security etc. Hence, the aim of the proposal amending the current ERDF Regulation is to provide, in the framework of an integrated approach, acceptable housing conditions. In this context, the role of public authorities at all stages of the implementation is of an outmost importance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the adoption and entry into force of international rules on liability for non-contractual damages arising from the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) by sea is crucial in view of the significant share HNS cargo represents in maritime freight transport worldwide. The International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, ('1996 HNS Convention') was aimed at ensuring adequate, prompt and effective compensation of persons who suffer damage caused by spills of hazardous and noxious substances, when carried by sea. The Protocol of 2010 to the 1996 HNS Convention contained necessary amendments to address problems identified in the 1996 HNS Convention. The 2010 Protocol and the provisions of the Convention, are to be read, interpreted and applied together as one single instrument. Neither the 1996 HNS Convention, nor the 2010 Protocol to the HNS Convention has entered into force. The latter has no contracting parties to it to this day. The 2010 Protocol, and thereby the consolidated 2010 HNS Convention, will enter into force 18 months after the date on which at least 12 States, 4 of which with no less than 2 million units of gross tonnage each, have ratified it, and the relevant data on contributing cargo have been submitted to the IMO Secretary-General showing no less than 40 million tonnes of cargo contributing to the general HNS account received in total in those States during the preceding calendar year. The main changes from the 1996 HNS Convention to the 2010 HNS Convention are: Given that issues related to judicial to judicial cooperation in civil matters do not apply to Denmark, the Council must adopt two separate decisions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: whilst no formal impact assessment was required, several options have been examined and weighed. The Commission considers that the conclusion of the 2010 Protocol to the HNS Convention will ensure: Using an international regime rather than regional solutions for these purposes better suits the nature of shipping as a global business. CONTENT: under the draft Council Decision, Member States would: State signature, ratification or acceptance of the 2010 Protocol nullifies any prior signature or ratification by that State of the 1996 HNS Convention. States ratifying the Protocol express their consent to be bound by the consolidated text of the 2010 HNS Convention, as a single, consolidated instrument for the Convention, which will take effect once the 2010 Protocol enters into force. When ratifying or acceding to the Protocol of 2010, Member States must inform the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organisation in writing that such ratification or accession has taken place in accordance with this Decision and the Decision adopted parallel to this Decision with regard to aspects falling within the competence conferred upon the Union in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters."

The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. This proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR) establishes together with Directive 2013/36/EU (the Capital Requirements Directive or CRD) the prudential regulatory framework for credit institutions operating in the Union. Adopted in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2007-2008 and largely based on international standards endorsed in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), known as the ""Basel III framework"", this prudential framework has contributed to enhancing the resilience of institutions operating in the Union and to making them better prepared to face potential difficulties, including difficulties stemming from possible future crises. The severe economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the exceptional containment measures are having a far-reaching impact on the economy. Credit institutions will have a major role to play in the recovery but are likely to suffer from the deterioration of the economic situation. The competent authorities have granted banks temporary relief from capital, liquidity and operational requirements so that they can continue to play their role in financing the real economy despite a more difficult environment. As a result of the exceptional situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, some of these rules can now be applied more flexibly, allowing banks to focus on lending to households and businesses. At the same time, it is essential that institutions continue to measure risks in an accurate, consistent and transparent manner to be able to monitor the effects of the pandemic on their balance sheets and avoid jeopardising the resilience of the European banking sector. This proposal is part of a package of measures taken by the European Commission to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak across the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes, as a short-term solution, to introduce targeted changes to EU banking prudential rules (the Capital Requirements Regulation) to maximise the capacity of credit institutions to lend and to absorb losses related to the Coronavirus pandemic, while still ensuring their continued resilience. Transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital The Commission proposes to amend the transitional arrangements to mitigate the potentially significant negative impact on institutions’ Common Equity Tier 1 capital arising from expected credit loss accounting under IFRS 9. The application of IFRS 9 during the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a sudden significant increase in expected credit loss provisions, as for many exposures expected losses over their lifetime may need to be calculated. In order to mitigate these potential negative effects, the Commission proposes to extend the current transitional provisions of the CRR by two years. Thus, the reference date for any increase in provisions that would fall under the extended transitional provisions would be moved from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2020. The extension of the transitional period would allow institutions to fully add-back to their CET1 capital any increase in new provisions recognised in 2020 and 2021 for their financial assets that are not credit-impaired. The amount that could be added back from 2022 to 2024 would decrease in a linear manner. Treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the non-performing loans prudential backstop Non-performing loans guaranteed official export credit agencies receive a preferential treatment regarding provisioning requirements under the CRR. It is proposed to temporarily extend this preferential treatment to exposures guaranteed or counter guaranteed by the public sector in the context of measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to Union State aid rules, where applicable. This would take account of the similar risk profile of these guaranteed exposures. Leverage ratio buffer application date The latest revision of the CRR imposed a leverage ratio buffer requirement on global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs). The date of application of this new requirement, initially set at 1 January 2022, shall be extended by one year to 1 January 2023. This would free up credit institutions’ operational capacity and allow them to focus on the more immediate challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Offsetting the impact of excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio In accordance with the Basel framework, the CRR grants discretionary power, in exceptional circumstances, to temporarily exclude certain central bank exposures from an institutions’ total exposure measure. The exemption may be granted for a limited period of time not exceeding one year. In order to facilitate the effective transmission of monetary policy actions, this discretion shall be implemented together with the leverage ratio requirement on 28 June 2021. However, the current crisis of the COVID-19 showed that the compensation mechanism was too restrictive. In order to provide greater flexibility to act in possible future crises, the proposal amends the compensation mechanism. In particular, a credit institution that exercises the discretion shall be required to calculate the adjusted leverage ratio only once, namely at the moment it exercises the discretion. The adjusted leverage ratio will apply throughout the full period during which the discretion is exercised and will not change like under the current offsetting mechanism. Other application dates The Commission also proposes that the application dates of some of the capital benefits envisaged in the CRR but not yet applicable need to be anticipated, namely: (i) the provisions on the treatment of certain software assets, (ii) the provisions on certain loans backed by pensions or salaries, (iii) the revised supporting factor for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and (iv) the new supporting factor for infrastructure finance. The objective is to allow credit institutions to free up capital and give their lending activity a much-needed boost during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath."

An agreement on future relations between the Union and the United Kingdom can only be concluded after the United Kingdom has become a third country. However, Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union requires that the framework for future relations with the Union be taken into account in the agreement setting out the arrangements for withdrawal. The withdrawal agreement sets out the terms and conditions for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU. It ensures that the withdrawal shall be carried out in an orderly manner, and provides legal certainty once the Treaties and Union law have ceased to apply in the United Kingdom. The withdrawal agreement is necessary to mitigate any negative effects on the European economy and the Union budget, protect the rights of the European citizens living and working in the United Kingdom, as well as safeguard the goal of peace and reconciliation in the island of Ireland. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. The Commission's draft text proposal for the withdrawal agreement consists of 185 articles structured in six parts, three protocols and nine annexes. The areas concerned are as follows: Part 1: Common Provisions The agreement sets out the clauses necessary to ensure the correct understanding, operation and interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. The provisions of the withdrawal agreement were clearly to have the same legal effects in the United Kingdom as in the EU and its Member States. The agreement expressly provides for this obligation, which means that both parties must ensure, in their respective legal systems, primacy and direct effect, as well as a consistent interpretation with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) prior to the end of the transitional period. Part 2: Citizens' Rights The agreement lays down provisions to safeguard the status and rights derived from Union law of EU and UK citizens, and their families, affected by the United Kingdom withdrawal. The basic conditions for residence are and will remain the same as those currently provided for under EU law on free movement. Persons covered by the withdrawal agreement will have the right to take up paid employment or engage in economic activity as self-employed workers. They will also retain all the rights they enjoy as workers under Union law. The withdrawal agreement will also protect the rights of employed or self-employed frontier workers in the countries where they work. As regards the rules on the coordination of social security systems, persons benefiting from the part of the withdrawal agreement devoted to citizens' rights will retain their rights to health care, a pension and other social security benefits. These provisions are intended to ensure a smooth termination of the current arrangements and to ensure an orderly withdrawal (for example, to allow goods placed on the market before the end of the transitional period to reach their destination, to protect existing intellectual property rights, to put an end to ongoing police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, to regulate the use of data and information exchanged before the end of the transitional period). Part 4 - Transition Period The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period until the end of 2020. During this period, the full acquis of the Union will continue to apply to the United Kingdom as if it were a Member State. The United Kingdom will thus continue to be part of the EU's customs union and single market (with the four freedoms) and to participate in the Union's policies. From the date of withdrawal (i.e. including during the transitional period), the United Kingdom will no longer be represented in the Union's institutions and will no longer participate in the Union's decision-making process. During the transition period, the United Kingdom will have to comply with the EU's trade policy and will continue to be bound by the Union's exclusive competence, in particular with regard to the common trade policy. It will not be able to conclude new agreements on its own in areas of exclusive Union competence, unless it is authorised to do so by the Union. The withdrawal agreement provides for the possibility of extending the transition period. This possibility may only be used once, the decision to this effect having to be taken before 1 July 2020. Part 5: Financial Provisions Under the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom will honour its share of the financing of all obligations incurred during its membership of the Union relating to the EU budget (and in particular the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, including payments made after the end of the transitional period linked to the closure of programmes). Part 6: Institutional Provisions The agreement sets out rules for the consistent interpretation and application of the agreement and establishes a Joint Committee as well as a dispute settlement mechanism. The withdrawal agreement also provides for: - a protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland including the provisions necessary for the so-called “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This will apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole or in part, by any subsequent agreement. The Protocol creates a single EU-UK customs territory. It also provides for a range of measures to ensure a level playing field between the EU and the United Kingdom. In this protocol, the United Kingdom undertakes not to reduce the rights set out in the Good Friday Agreement (Belfast Agreement) of 1998, and to protect North-South cooperation; - a Protocol on Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus , to protect the interests of Cypriots living and working in the Sovereign Base Areas after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union; - a Protocol on Gibraltar , which provides for close cooperation between Spain and the United Kingdom on Gibraltar, as regards the implementation of the provisions of the withdrawal agreement relating to citizens' rights, and which concerns administrative cooperation between the competent authorities in a number of policy areas. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only budgetary impact of the withdrawal agreement (EUR 288 million per year over 4 years) stems from the establishment of the Joint Committee which will supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the withdrawal agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the post-2020 multiannual financial framework, the Commission intends to propose a new tool to support Member States in the implementation of the structural reforms adopted in the framework of the European Semester. This tool shall have its own budgetary endowment, separate from and in addition to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI). This new reform delivery tool shall seek to support a broad range of reforms such as in product and labour markets, tax reforms, the development of capital markets, reforms to improve the business environment as well as investment in human capital and public administration reforms. The Commission intends to test the main features of this reform delivery tool in a pilot phase for the period 2018-2020, by offering the possibility to Member States to use all or part of the performance reserve in the current European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds to support reforms instead of specific projects. To this end, the Commission proposes amendments to the Regulation (EU) 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI funds). CONTENT: the proposal opens the possibility to partially or fully allocate the performance reserve set up by Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to support the reform commitments undertaken by the Members States. A Member State which opts for a partial or full allocation of the performance reserve shall propose to the Commission a detailed set of measures appropriate for the implementation of structural reforms in accordance with Union law. This proposal shall include reform commitments which shall contain milestones and targets for the implementation of the reform measures and a timetable which shall not be longer than three years. The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act , setting out the reform commitments to be implemented by the Member State and the amount allocated from the performance reserve for their support. Support to structural reforms by Member States shall take the form of a financing not linked to cost shall be managed in line with the rules for direct management set out in that Regulation, and shall not require national co-financing. The amount allocated to the implementation of the structural reforms should be proportionate to the nature and importance of the reform and should complement existing Union support to national reforms The Member State shall regularly report within the mechanisms of the European Semester on the progress in the achievement of the reform commitment."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the consequences of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for farmers and rural businesses are unprecedented. Mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments have led to economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances. CONTENT: the proposal includes limited and targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 providing exceptional and temporary support to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, which are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Exceptional temporary support Support under this measure shall consist of temporary emergency aid to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis to ensure the continuity of their activities. It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years."
2600EP7,"""""European Fisheries Fund""""",0.719,0.85,0.895,0.581,0.303,0.843,0.862,0.771,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to help those Member States most affected by the financial crisis to continue their programmes on the ground funded by the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) so as to inject funds into the economy. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the deepening of the financial crisis in some of the Member States is affecting substantially the real economy due to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by Governments to borrow money from the market. In this context, the proper implementation of programmes funded by the EFF is of particular importance because it facilitates financial assistance to the real economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the euro countries or from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non euro countries. To date, six countries have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme: Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. These Member States (and indeed any other Member State which may be concerned in the future by such assistance programmes) should receive help to continue the implementation of the programmes funded by the EFF by increasing the sums allocated to the countries concerned for the period for which they are under the support mechanisms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to increase payments to the countries concerned, for the period they are under the support mechanisms. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to ensure that these Member States continue the implementation of the EFF programmes on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the current proposal contains provisions that would allow the Commission to make increased payments to these countries, for the period they are under the support mechanisms. It is proposed to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund so as to enable the Commission to reimburse the newly declared expenditure for the period in question by an increased amount calculated by applying a 10 percentage point top-up of the applicable co-financing rates for the priority axis. In applying the top-up, the co-financing rate of the programme cannot exceed by more than 10 percentage points the maximum ceilings of the EFF Regulation. In any case, contribution from the funds to the priority axis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned in the Commission decision. This will be a temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits the support mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPACT: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of the European Fisheries Fund financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. For payment appropriations in 2012, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal will imply an increase of payment appropriations (for 2012 approximately EUR 20 million) which will be compensated by the end of the programming period. Therefore, the total payment appropriations for the whole programming period remain unchanged. The Commission will, in 2012, review the need for additional payment credits and if necessary propose the necessary actions to the Budgetary Authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in July 2011, the Foreign Affairs Council1 expressed its willingness to negotiate an agreement with Afghanistan that would reflect its long-term commitment to the country’s development. In November 2011, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative to negotiate a Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development (CAPD) with Afghanistan After three rounds of negotiations that went on until November 2012, talks were resumed in 2015, with the new Afghan Government. The fourth and final round of negotiations took place in Brussels on 29 April 2015 and was concluded successfully. The two sides initialled the Agreement in Kabul on 2 July 2015. CONTENT: the proposal requires the Council to adopt a decision to approve the Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development between the European Union and Afghanistan. The Agreement is the first contractual relationship between the European Union and Afghanistan and underpins the EU’s commitment to supporting Afghanistan’s future development during its ‘decade of transformation’ agreed at the Bonn conference in 2011. The two parties are committed to pursuing and extending their cooperation, to strengthening existing links and to establishing a close and lasting relationship based on reciprocity and mutual interests. The Agreement includes provisions on political dialogue and on cooperation in a broad range of areas. It draws on the EU’s standard political clauses on human rights and the International Criminal Court, and includes commitments related to the rights of women and children. It reiterates the willingness of the parties to address shared concerns, including: The provisions on cooperation cover the following sectors: The Agreement also emphasises the importance of legal cooperation and affirms the parties’ commitment to fighting organised crime, money laundering and corruption."
6421EP7,"""""European Year for Development (2015)""""",0.404,0.839,0.93,0.129,0.182,0.831,0.815,0.086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European Year of Development (2015). PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is the biggest donor of official development aid (ODA) in the world, providing more than half of all aid given worldwide. Its strong commitment to supporting partner countries dates back to 1957, when the Treaties of Rome first established a European development policy. Despite this strong commitment to supporting partner countries, EU citizens often lack information on development cooperation, why it is needed and on the added value of development policies at EU level. The October 2012 Eurobarometer survey highlighted significant areas of ignorance, with 53 % of respondents indicating that they know nothing about where EU aid goes (44 % are unaware of where their country’s bilateral aid goes). It is important to raise European citizens’ awareness of global interdependence. People need information as to how an outward-looking Europe can help to ensure global sustainability. Against this background, The EYD2015 is an opportunity to improve the level of information in all Member States IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in October 2012, the European Parliament called on the Commission to make 2015 the European Year for Development, expressing its hope that this would raise the profile of development cooperation. The Commission services and the External Action Service have been informally consulted on the idea of the EYD2015. The European Parliament and Member States have been informally contacted on the organisation of the EYD2015 . Furthermore, the issue is on the agenda for the regular meeting with Member States’ Directors-General responsible for development in June 2013. Given the external relations dimension of the EYD2015, informal discussions have also taken place with international organisations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209 and Article 210(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposed Decision is to establish a European Year of Development in 2015. Objectives : the general purpose of the European Year shall be: to inform EU citizens about EU development cooperation, highlighting what the European Union can already achieve as the biggest aid donor in the world; to stimulate the active interest of European citizens in development cooperation and foster a sense of responsibility and opportunity as regards their participation in policy formulation and implementation; and to raise awareness of the role of EU development cooperation. Initiatives involved : the proposal presents the measures taken to achieve the objectives. These may include the following initiatives organised at Union, national, regional or local level: communication campaigns to disseminate key messages targeted at the general public and more specific audiences, including through social media; the organisation of conferences, events and initiatives with all relevant stakeholders, to promote active participation and debate, and to raise awareness at European level; concrete initiatives in the Member States aimed at promoting the objectives of the European Year, in particular through the exchange of information and sharing of experience and good practices among national, regional, local administrations and other organisations; and undertaking studies and surveys and disseminating their results. A detailed Annex outlines the actions proposed and the operational means as to how the objectives may be achieved. 3 different types of actions are laid down: direct Union initiatives; co-financing Union initiatives; co-financing Member States’ initiatives. The Commission may identify other activities as contributing to the objectives of the European Year and may allow references to the European Year to be used in promoting those activities, insofar as they contribute to achieving the objectives of the Decision. Coordination with Member States : each Member State is invited to appoint a national coordinator to be responsible for organising its involvement in the European Year, and shall inform the Commission of that appointment. The national coordinators shall, in close coordination with the Commission, consult and cooperate with a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including civil society, national parliaments, social partners and, where appropriate, the national agencies or contact points for the relevant Union programmes. By 1 June 2014, Member States are invited to transmit to the Commission their proposed work programme, which shall set out details of the national activities planned for the European Year of Development. Participating countries : participation in the activities of the European Year to be financed shall be open to: (i) Member States; (ii) candidate countries benefiting from a pre-accession strategy. Coordination at Union level and implementation : the Commission shall implement this Decision at the level of the Union, in particular by adopting the necessary financing decisions in accordance with the Regulations establishing the Financing Instruments relevant to the actions concerned. It shall cooperate closely with Member States, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the bodies and associations active in development issues. The Commission shall make the theme of the European Year a priority in the communication activities of its Representations in the Member States and the European Union Delegations in partner countries. Consistency and complementarity : the Commission shall ensure that the measures provided for in this Decision are consistent with any other Union, national and regional schemes and initiatives that help attain the objectives of the European Year. Specific provisions on financial and non-financial support : measures are provided to define the mode of access to financing of measures related to the European Year (depending on the case, procurement or the award of grants financed from the general budget of the Union. Non-financial support may be granted by the Commission for activities undertaken by public and private organisations which comply with certain conditions laid down in the Decision (use of the logo etc). Measures are provided as regards the protection of the Union’s financial interests and the fight against fraud. Monitoring and evaluation : by 31 December 2016, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in this Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: no additional funding is sought for the European Year of Development. The flexibility for annual priority settings based on the budget lines and programmes of the Communication provides sufficient margin for running the Year on a EUR 15 million scale. For 2013 and 2014, the amounts under management of DG DEVCO amount to EUR 14.20 million enabling the financing of the operational activities of the European Year."
6612EP7,"""""Correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters""""",0.912,0.857,0.982,0.613,0.364,0.892,0.877,0.743,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve customs risk management and strengthen the detection and prevention of customs-related fraud. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. . ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fight against breach of customs legislation entails extensive exchange of information in the framework of cooperation both between Member States and between the latter and the Commission. While such cooperation has already been successful, a number of areas have been identified where further action is necessary, mainly as regards the functioning of the antifraud system in the customs field and the improvement of customs risk management at national and Union levels. There are several challenges. ·  Address loopholes in the existing systems for the detection of customs-related fraud : the Commission considers that the effectiveness of current measures might be improved if the relevant services are supported by systematic availability of high-quality and timely data on container movements (Container Status Messages - CSMs) carrying goods, imports, exports and transit at national and EU levels. ·  Enhance customs risk management and supply chain security at national and EU levels: there is a need to: (i) establish an equivalent level of customs controls for goods brought into/ taken out of the customs territory of the Union; (ii) introduce a Union-wide risk management framework to support a common approach. ·  Address delays in OLAF investigations : the documents supporting import and export declarations (invoice, certificate of origin, etc.) are no longer kept by customs administrations but by economic operators. Member States must first obtain this information from economic operators before transmitting the information to the Commission. Such a system is inefficient because it delays OLAF’s investigations. ·  Clarify the possibility of restricting visibility of data : the AFIS IT system is currently underused because Member States are not able to select the potential users of the information they insert in the system. Users would more readily share information that they possess within the AFIS system if they were able to shield sensitive data. ·  Streamline data protection supervision : it is necessary to have closer collaboration between the two supervisory bodies: the European Data Protection Supervisor – EDPS and Customs Joint Supervisory Authority – CJSA. Another issue in the area of data protection which needs to be further clarified is the responsibility for the technical systems established by the Commission. ·  Clarify the admissibility of evidence collected under mutual assistance : it appears necessary to clarify that the evidence obtained through mutual assistance may be used by prosecutors in the national criminal proceedings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of policy options concluded that the main amendments would comprise the following objectives: (i) create conditions for improved fighting of customs fraud related to misdeclaration of goods origin, misdescription of goods and misuse of the transit system; (ii) speed up OLAF investigations. The proposed options are in line with the fundamental rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) n° 515/97 so as to improve the detection, investigation and prevention of customs-related fraud, by increasing the exchange of information and the available evidence, and improving the functioning of the established system. Specifically, the proposal aims to: ·  update the concept of customs legislation, in order to have the terminology aligned with the customs field, adding references to entry and exit of goods; ·  remove the legal uncertainty that currently exists in relation to the possible use of information collected through mutual assistance as evidence in national criminal proceedings; ·  oblige carriers to supply the Commission with the information on container movements (i.e. Container Status Messages — CSMs); ·  create a central database for import and export data; ·  create a centralised repository for transit-related data; ·  enable the Commission to obtain directly from private sector operators documents supporting import and export declarations, in order to speed up OLAF’s investigations; ·  introduce the possibility of selecting the potential users of data (restricted visibility) so that Member States might increase the use of databases and consequently contribute to efficiency; ·  simplify and harmonise the rules for the supervision of data protection rules applicable to the EDPS and the CJSA. The proposal also introduces a maximum retention period of ten years for data stored in the CIS, stipulating that in cases where personal data are stored for a period exceeding five years, the EDPS should be informed accordingly. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary cost is estimated at EUR 60.526 million (including human resources and other administrative expenditure) for the period 2014-2020. The budgetary effort concerns mainly the IT costs to maintain and further develop the existing AFIS system. The costs related to the implementation of the proposal will be handled within the framework of the existing forecast in the context of Multiannual Financial Framework and therefore no additional request for budgetary allocation is required. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cross-border labour mobility has notably increased in recent years. In 2017, 17 million European citizens lived or worked in a Member State other than that of their nationality. This figure almost doubled compared to a decade ago. Postings have increased by 68% from 2010 to 2.3 million in 2016. There are 1.4 million EU citizens commuting to work in another Member State. There are also over 2 million workers in the road transport sector who cross intra-EU borders on a daily basis to transport goods or passengers. The European Pillar of Social Rights – proclaimed jointly by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017 - sets out a number of key principles and rights to support fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems. Ensuring fair labour mobility in Europe is central to this objective. As outlined in their Joint Declaration on the legislative priorities for 2018-2019, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are committed to taking action to reinforce the social dimension of the Union, by working on improving the coordination of social security systems, by protecting workers from health risks in the workplace, by ensuring fair treatment for all in the Union labour market through modernised rules on posting of workers, and by further improving cross-border enforcement of the Union law. In this context, the Commission proposes the creation of a ""European Labour Authority"" to ensure that EU rules on worker mobility are observed in a fair, simple and effective manner. This initiative will complement and facilitate the implementation of ongoing initiatives aimed at ensuring fair mobility, including through the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive and of the lex specialis on the posting of workers in international road transport operations and the modernisation of EU provisions on the coordination of social security systems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three policy options were considered for the proposed Authority, these being a support option, an operational option, and a supervisory option. The operational option to be performed through a new Authority that builds on existing EU level mobility bodies turned out to be the most effective way to meet the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal for a regulation aims at setting up a European Labour Authority, in the form of a decentralised EU agency, to help individuals, businesses and national administrations to make the most of the opportunities offered by free movement and to ensure a level playing field for workers' mobility. The Authority has three objectives: 1. facilitate access for individuals and employers to information on their rights and obligations as well as to relevant services. The Authority will provide information on employment, learning, mobility, recruitment and training opportunities, as well as guidance on the rights and obligations of those who live, work or are engaged in cross-border activities in another EU Member State; 2. support operational cooperation between authorities to ensure cross-border compliance with the relevant Union law, including facilitating the organisation of joint inspections. For example, the Authority will help to improve the exchange of information, support capacity building in national administrations, and assist them in carrying out joint inspections. The objectives are to enhance mutual trust between the actors, to improve day-to-day cooperation and to prevent possible fraud and abuse; 3. propose mediation and facilitate the search for solutions in the event of disputes between national authorities and cross-border disruptions of the labour market such as restructuring of companies affecting several Member States. The new Authority will pool technical and operational tasks of existing EU bodies into a permanent structure with a view to achieving improved and more efficient output In this context, the Authority will take over the management of the EURES European Coordination Office and replace: (i) the Technical Committee on the Free Movement of Workers; (ii) the Committee of Experts on Posting of Workers; (iii) he Technical Commission, the Audit Board, and the Conciliation Board of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security Systems; (iv) replace the European Platform on tackling undeclared work. The Authority will benefit all those subject to Union rules in the field of cross-border mobility of labour and the coordination of social security, specifically, workers, whether employed or not, or any other citizen of the Union or a third-country national legally residing in the Union and in a cross-border situation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total budgetary cost for the EU of the Authority is estimated at EUR 50.9 million per year at cruising speed (which should be reached by 2023). As regards staff numbers, the Authority would need 69 establishment plan posts, 60 seconded national experts and 15 contract agents."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since the first cases of the COVID-19 contagion, the EU has been working tirelessly to support the Member States and their citizens in addressing the crisis. The ARGUS crisis coordination mechanism of the Commission has been activated and a coordinating response team at political level has been established, composed of the five commissioners responsible for the most affected policies. The Commission considers it essential that the Union and its Member States act collectively to contain the spread of the virus and help patients, but also to counter the economic fallout. As part of this joint coordinated response, the EU Solidarity Fund ( EUSF ) can play an important role in showing EU solidarity to Member States in dealing with the emergency situation. The EUSF was created in 2002 to support EU Member States and accession countries in situations of major disasters caused by natural events such as floods, storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, forest fires or drought. The EUSF may award financial assistance to eligible States totalling up to EUR 500 million in 2011 prices per year. However, the current EUSF is strictly limited to natural disasters causing physical damage and does not include major disasters due to biological hazards. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions enabling the Union to intervene in the event of a major public health emergency such as COVID-19. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to include major public health crises in the emergencies that the EU Solidarity Fund finances with the aim of mobilising it if necessary for the most affected Member States. The proposal aims to provide financial assistance to provide immediate support in response to a request from a Member State or a candidate country. Union assistance should be complementary to the efforts of the States concerned and be used to cover a share of the public expenditure committed to dealing with the most essential emergency operations resulting from the emergency situation. The threshold for natural disasters was therefore set at direct damage exceeding 0.6% of gross national income (GNI) or EUR 3 billion (in 2011 prices), whereby the lower amount applies. In the case of major health emergencies, the Commission proposes take the financial burden on Member States’ budgets in order to face the additional needs. Accordingly, it is proposed to maintain the principles on which access to the EUSF is based. Accordingly, the lower of 0.3% of GNI or EUR 1.5 billion in 2011 prices, i.e. half of that applicable to natural disasters, are defined as the minimum level of public expenditure related to the public financial burden inflicted on the eligible State for emergency response measures. The proposal strengthens the existing provisions on the payment of advances by increasing the amounts of the advances. Specifically, the Commission proposes: - to raise the level of advance payments for individual disasters of all categories to 25% of the expected EUSF contribution, limited to a maximum of EUR 100 million; - to increase the total level of appropriations for EUSF advances in the annual budget from EUR 50 million to EUR 100 million. In order to ensure the timely availability of resources where necessary, the Commission shall propose to enter additional appropriations for a maximum of EUR 50 million in the budget for 2020. The financial envelope foreseen for the Fund also follows the existing Solidarity Fund, with an annual amount of EUR 500 million (2011 prices). The ceiling of the maximum EUSF allocation for 2020 is respected (EUR 597.546 million, plus EUR 552.978 carried over from 2019)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the crisis in the financial markets which has unfolded since 2008 has put the issue of financial reporting and auditing at the centre of the Union's political agenda. A well- functioning common financial reporting framework is essential for the internal market, for the effective functioning of the capital markets and for the realisation of the integrated market for financial services in the EU. In a global economy, there is a need for a global accounting language. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were adopted by the EU in 2002 and used in many jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, Europe will need more weight in the international standard setting process for its voice to be heard. promote the global adoption of IFRS; Decision No 716/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a Community programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing. On the basis of that Decision, (i) the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), the European Commission's technical adviser in accounting matters, (ii) the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation; the legal successor of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, IASCF) and (iii) the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) benefit from Union co-financing in the form of operating grants until 31 December 2013. The purpose of the proposed Regulation is to renew that Programme for the next financial framework (2014-2020) and enable direct contributions to the funding of the Programme's beneficiaries from the Union budget during that period. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in the ex ante evaluation accompanying this proposal, the Commission found that the Programme for 2009 to 2013 had met the expectations and objectives set and that financing should be continued. Moreover, the financing Programme was set up with the aim of meeting long-term objectives. Thus, it is appropriate to propose it being continued in the next financial framework of 2014-2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a Union programme for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 to support the activities of bodies which contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives of the Union in relation to financial reporting and auditing. The co-financing programme is expected to contribute to the objectives of: · ensuring comparability and transparency of company accounts throughout the EU; · ensuring the global harmonisation of financial reporting standards by promoting the international acceptance of IFRS; · promoting convergence and high quality international standards for auditing in all Member States. The programme also contributes to the Europe 2020 strategy by reinforcing the single market of financial services and capital, and contributes to the strategy's external dimension as well. The Programme covers: (i) the activities of developing or providing input to the development of standards; (ii) activities relating to applying, assessing or monitoring standards or overseeing standard-setting processes in support of the implementation of Union policies in the field of financial reporting and auditing. The beneficiaries under the Programme are the following: · in the field of financial reporting: (i)the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG); (ii) the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation); · in the field of auditing: the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). Within the current institutional framework, the new funding arrangements will ensure stable, diversified, sound and adequate funding to enable the relevant bodies to carry out their Union-related or Union public interest mission in an independent and efficient manner. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total amount to be borne by the Union’s budget is EUR 58.01 million in commitment appropriations for the 2014-2020 period. The financial envelope is divided up as follows: · IFRS Foundation: EUR 32 227 000 · EFRAG: EUR 23 508 000 · PIOB: EUR 2 275 000 EUR.

The parliamentary committee recommended that the position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure modify the Commission proposal as follows. Purpose of the regulation : this regulation should lay down rules for the creation and proper functioning of the Single European Sky in order to ensure current air traffic safety standards, to contribute to the sustainable development of the air transport system, and in particular, reducing climate impact. The Single European Sky shall comprise a coherent network at the pan-European level and, subject to specific arrangements with the neighbouring countries, in third-countries, an integrated operating airspace, network management and air traffic management for the benefit of all airspace users. National aviation authorities : these shall be legally distinct and independent, in particular in organisational, hierarchical and decision-making terms – and with their annual budget - from any company, organisation, public or private entity or personnel falling within the scope of authority activity as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 or having an interest in the activities of such entities. Staff of the national aviation authorities shall be recruited under clear and transparent rules and criteria which guarantee their independence. They shall not be seconded from air navigation service providers (ANSPs) or companies under the control of ANSPs. Persons who have been in charge of strategic decisions for more than six months shall have no professional position or responsibility with any of the air navigation service providers after their term in the national aviation authority, for a period ofat least 12 months for staff in managerial positions (at least six months for staff in non-managerial positions). Definitions : the Members added important definitions, namely that of a “local performance target” and “industrial partnership” which, according to the proposal, will now be a “driving force” within newly-structured functional airspace blocks (FABs). The definition of the “human factor” was also introduced, meaning the social, cultural and staffing conditions in the air traffic management (ATM) sector The human factor must be monitored and brought into the core of the Single European Sky framework. Cooperation between national aviation authorities : The Commission and the European Aviation Agency (EAA) shallfacilitate active cooperation of these authorities to enable them to exchange their best practices and to develop common solutions, including stronger cooperation at the regional level, and placing at their disposal a platform for these exchanges. This cooperation should take place in a network that convenes at regular intervals (at least once a year). The purpose and tasks of the network was spelled out in more detail: it must, among others, provide opinions to the Commission and the EAA on rule-making and certification and provide recommendations designed to facilitate the provision of cross-border services. Certification of air navigation service providers : the issue of certificates shall confer on air navigation service providers the possibility of offering their services to any Member State, and if appropriate, neighbouring third countries, within a functional airspace block, subject to mutual agreement between the relevant parties. Provision of support services : “support services” means communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS), meteorological services (MET) and aeronautical information services (AIS) as well as other services and activities, which are linked to, and support the provision of, air navigation services. According to the report, there should be no statutory impediments to providers of support services that would prevent their ability to compete within the Union on the basis of equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent conditions for the purpose of providing these services. Members proposed that air navigation service providers, when drawing up their business plans, should call for offers from different support services providers, with a view to choosing the financially and qualitatively most beneficial provider. Binding selection criteria for the entity procuring those services shall be, in particular, cost and energy efficiency, overall service quality, interoperability and safety of services, as well as transparency of the procurement process. System and performance criteria : Members proposed that a “performance review body” (PRB) be established as a European economic regulatorunder the supervision of the Commission, with effect from 1 July 2015. The PRB shall be functionally and legally separate from any service provider, whether at national or pan-European level. The compliance of the local performance plans and local targets with the Union-wide performance targets shall be assessed by the Commission in cooperation with the PRB. In addition to the introduction of sanctions, an appropriate compensation mechanism must also be established in order to address the problem stemming from the lack of synchronisation in SESAR deployment and lost investment resulting thereof. The Commission may propose financial mechanisms to improve the synchronisation of air-based and ground-based capital expenditure related to the deployment of SESAR technologies. Implementation of the ATM Master Plan : implementation of the ATM Master Plan shall be coordinated by the Commission. The Network Manager, the PRB and the Deployment Manager shall contribute to the implementation of the ATM Master Plan in accordance with the provisions of this regulation. The Commission shall adopt, by implementing acts, measures establishing the governance of implementation of the ATM Master Plan, including defining and selecting the body responsible at management level (Deployment Manager). Industrial partnerships : Members stipulated that industrial partnerships should be separate from FABs, which are a state initiative. What is more, industrial partnerships need not overlap with FABs in terms of the Member States concerned and therefore should be classed as a separate type of cooperation."

BACKGROUND: the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway was negotiated by the Commission, as authorised by the Council on 21 December 2016. This Agreement is based on the Air Transport Agreement (ATA) between the EU and the United States, which was signed on 25 and 30 April 2007. The EU-US ATA is the most important air transport agreement in the world, providing more than 75 million seats per year, and as such a cornerstone of the EU’s external aviation policy. The ATA between the EU and the US foresees an open wet-lease regime between the parties. The negotiating directives set out the general objective of negotiating a Wet Lease Agreement with the aim of providing precision to the relevant provisions of the ATA and abolishing time limitations for wet lease arrangements affecting the EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to authorise, on behalf of the Union, the conclusion of the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland, and the Kingdom of Norway. The Wet Lease Agreement will resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the application of the wet lease provisions of the ATA, and as such contribute to the well-functioning of the transatlantic aviation relationship The Agreement confirms the establishment of clear and non-restrictive wet lease arrangements involving the airlines of the Parties, thereby providing more precision to the respective provisions of the ATA. The Wet Lease Agreement not only resolves the current dispute on the application of the relevant provisions of the ATA, it also provides clarity and legal certainty for future arrangements affecting EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers."
10855EP9,"""""Adequate minimum wages in the European Union""""",0.177,0.429,0.865,0.329,0.579,0.667,0.851,0.732,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a framework to improve the adequacy of minimum wages and to increase the access of workers to minimum wage protection. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: adequate minimum wages are a fundamental component of the European model of social market economy. When set at adequate levels, minimum wages protect the income of disadvantaged workers, help ensure a decent living, and limit the fall in income during bad times. During economic recessions, such as the COVID-19 crisis, the role of minimum wages in protecting low-wage workers is essential to support a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery. Principle 6 of the Pillar on ‘Wages’ calls for adequate minimum wages as well as for transparent and predictable wage setting to be put in place, according to national practices and respecting the autonomy of the social partners. Minimum wage protection can be provided by collective agreements (as is the case in six Member States) or by statutory minimum wages set by law (as is the case in 21 Member States). However, many workers are currently not protected by adequate minimum wages in the EU. In the majority of Member States with national statutory minimum wages, minimum wages are too low vis-à-vis other wages or to provide a decent living, even if they have increased in recent years. National statutory minimum wages are lower than 60% of the gross median wage and/or 50% of the gross average wage in almost all Member States. In 2018, the statutory minimum wage did not provide sufficient income for a single minimum-wage earner to reach the at-risk-of-poverty threshold in nine Member States. In this context, the proposed directive aims to ensure that EU workers are protected by adequate minimum wages allowing for a decent living wherever they work. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the quantitative analysis carried out on a scenario based on a hypothetical increase of minimum wages to 60% of the gross median wage shows that it would improve the adequacy of minimum wages in about half of the Member States. Between 10 and 20 million workers would benefit from these improvements. In several countries, improvements in minimum wage protection would result in a reduction of in-work poverty and wage inequality by over 10% and a reduction in the gender pay gap by about 5% or more. CONTENT: the proposed directive establishes minimum requirements at EU level to ensure both that minimum wages are set at an adequate level and that workers can have access to the protection offered by minimum wages, either in the form of a statutory minimum wage or in the form of wages set by collective agreements. The proposal respects Member States’ competence to set higher standards, without prejudice to the role that Member States may entrust to social partners, in accordance with national traditions and in full respect of social partners’ contractual freedom. The proposed Directive: - would apply to workers with an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by law, collective agreements or practice in each Member State, including workers in atypical forms of employment ; - would oblige Member States to take measures to promote the capacity of the social partners to engage in collective bargaining on wages to encourage wage bargaining. In the case of countries where there is a legal minimum wage, the proposal: - requires Member States to provide for national criteria for setting and updating statutory minimum wages that are defined in a stable and clear manner, regular and timely updates and the establishment of consultative bodies; - calls on the Member States, in consultation with the social partners to: (i) limit the use of variations in minimum wages and their application over time and their extent and (ii) provide for the protection of statutory minimum wages against unjustified or disproportionate deductions; - requires effective and timely participation of the social partners in the setting and updating of statutory minimum wages, including through participation in consultative bodies; - Requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that workers have effective access to the protection offered by statutory minimum wages (e.g. strengthening the system of controls and field inspections, informing workers about applicable statutory minimum wages). With a view to monitoring the implementation of this Directive, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council its assessment of developments in the adequacy and coverage of minimum wages on the basis of the information provided by Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp fall in air traffic due to a significant drop in demand and the adoption by Member States and third countries of direct measures, such as border closures and flight bans, to curb its spread. Figures published by the EU Network Manager at the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (‘Eurocontrol’), indicate a fall in air traffic of around 90% for the European region at the end of March 2020 as compared to March 2019. The aviation sector is of strategic importance to the European Union and makes a vital contribution to the EU’s overall economy and employment. In 2016, for example, the aviation sector supported 9.4 million jobs in the EU and contributed more than EUR 624 billion to the EU's GDP. It also contributes to the success of SMEs and tourism. The liquidity crisis in the aviation sector may lead to insolvencies within a few months if left unaddressed. Given the contribution of aviation to the overall performance of the EU economy and the importance of its overall weight, the Commission considers it essential that the EU takes action to support the EU aviation sector. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to temporarily amend several provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to allow the Commission and national authorities to more easily address a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate of the impacts on the aviation sector for the duration of the crisis. These temporary measures include the following: Modification to air carrier licencing rules in case of financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, Member States must suspend or revoke the operating licence of any air carrier, which may not to be able to fulfil its actual or potential financial obligations for the next twelve months. Alternatively, the authorities may grant a temporary licence to such airlines. However, experience has shown that it also sends a very negative signal to the market about the ability of an airline to survive, which in turn aggravates its financial problems, in particular in terms of cash flow. Accordingly, the proposal proposes that based on assessments, carried out from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, the competent licensing authority may decide before the end of that period not to suspend or revoke the operating license of the Union carrier provided that safety is not at risk, and that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction within the following 12 months. Simplification of procedures for the imposition of restrictions on traffic rights The proposal provides for a temporary derogation to procedural requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. The derogation clarifies that a Member State may temporarily keep a justified and proportionate emergency measure in place for a period beyond 14 days – but limited to the duration of public health risks clearly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should be able to refuse, limit or impose conditions on the exercise of traffic rights to deal with problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which could be of extended duration. Such emergency measures taken in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic should respect the principles of proportionality and transparency and should be based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. At the request of any of the Member State(s) involved or on its own initiative, the Commission may suspend this action if it does not meet the requirements of the Regulation or is otherwise contrary to Union law. To this effect, Member States are obliged to inform the Commission about changes in duration and scope of their emergency measures. Improving the efficiency of ground handling contracting during the COVID-19 crisis The proposal allows the managing bodies of airport to prolong contracts of suppliers of ground handling service until 31 December 2021, in derogation of Directive 96/67/EC. It also allows the managing body of an airport to directly choose a ground handling service for a maximum period of six months. The amendments also provide for the possibility for the Commission to extend the periods concerned by means of delegated acts."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since it accounts for 18 % of world exports and 20 % of world imports, the EU can claim to be the world's number one importer and exporter of agricultural products, jockeying for position with the United States. Over the years, the European sector has focussed on quality and added value, offering processed products that are increasingly popular in Europe and worldwide. Nevertheless, on the internal market only a small minority of European consumers are aware of the efforts undertaken by European farmers to supply high-quality, healthy and safe products. Only 14 % of Europeans recognise the logos of products that benefit from a protected designation of origin (PDO) or a protected geographical indication (PGI), these being the main European quality schemes established by the Union. European agriculture is faced today with a much more competitive environment, largely resulting from the globalisation of markets. This trend should continue in the coming years with the prospect of the Doha round and various bilateral and regional agreements currently under negotiation being concluded. Though often feared, these agreements might also give rise to major opportunities for the sector. Council Regulation (EC) n° 3/2008 currently sets out the main principles of the information provision and promotion measures on the internal market and in third countries for agricultural products. Reform of this policy is needed, one which learns from the lessons of the promotional programmes implemented to date. The objective is to support agriculture, and especially the SMEs and producer organisations that form the backbone of this sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the ‘targeted’ scenario is the favoured option: this scenario ensures targeting of promotion measures on the internal and external markets through the development and implementation of a strategy. It also encourages collaboration between operators in the various Member States (by means of directly managed multi-country programmes). The strategy will also allow the range of products and themes eligible under the promotion scheme to be widened. Lastly, this scenario involves better use of indications of the origin of products and brand names (e.g. ""banner"" brands). CONTENT: in view of the experience gained and likely trends in the agricultural sector and on markets both inside and outside the Union, the Commission proposes to repeal Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 replace it with a new regulation. The proposal aims to enable information provision and promotion measures necessary for the agricultural sector to be able to rise to the many challenges it faces in a context of growing competition and opening-up of markets to be implemented on the internal market and in third countries. The main points of the proposed reform are as follows: ·  measures targeting the internal market, limited to providing information on the specific characteristics of agricultural production methods in the Union or on themes which are relevant to the Union, such as the European quality systems; ·  measures to enhance the authenticity of Union products so as to improve consumers' awareness as to the qualities of genuine products as compared to imitations and counterfeit products; ·  opening up the information and promotion scheme to certain food products based on agricultural products; ·  the eligibility of wine for the information provision and promotion measures to be limited solely to wine which is associated with another agricultural or food product. ·  strict guidelines as regards the possibilities of mentioning the origin of products or brand names as a means of illustrating the main generic message highlighting the intrinsic characteristics of European agricultural products; ·  specific arrangements to encourage a larger number of information provision and promotion measures for Union agricultural products in third countries, with the aim of reaching 75 % of estimated expenditure; ·  opening up the scheme to producer organisations; ·  establishment of a work programme which defines the strategic priorities for these measures in terms of populations, products, themes or markets to be targeted and the nature of the information and promotion messages to be imparted; ·  development of new technical and support services at European level with the aim of helping operators take part in co-financed programmes, conduct effective campaigns or develop their export activities. ·  better management of programmes submitted by operators in different Member States; ·  a systematic impact assessment in order to confirm that the goals set have indeed been achieved; ·  simplification of administrative procedures: the Commission will be more active in managing multi-country programmes, thereby making it easier for them to be set up and implemented. The respective roles of Member State and the Commission in terms of monitoring and control must be clarified in order to avoid duplication and lengthy procedures. It is proposed that selection should take place solely at Commission level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: compared to the present situation, the proposal gradually but significantly increases the budget allocated to information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (from EUR 61.5 million in the 2013 budget to EUR 200 million in 2020). Total expenditure is estimated at EUR 883 million for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
4371EP7,"""""Serious cross-border threats to health""""",0.895,0.908,0.947,0.71,0.545,0.892,0.928,0.857,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: establish a European initiative to combat serious cross-border threats to health. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: many activities related to preparedness and response planning and risk assessment for communicable diseases but also for chemical threats to health and events caused by climate change have been supported at European level, in particular the current Community network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases (see Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community). The EU already has policies, mechanisms and instruments in place for the prevention and control of serious cross-border threats and for the development of capacities to manage crises. A non-exhaustive list includes the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the Cohesion and Solidarity Funds, the EU action plan on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security, and European alert networks, such as ECURIE. In order to avoid overlaps with these areas and duplicating existing disaster prevention and control structures, a gap analysis has been carried out to assess how far these existing systems cover the monitoring of threats to health, their notification, risk assessment and crisis management capacities and structures from the public health perspective. This gap analysis revealed that the existing structures and mechanisms at EU level do not address these threats sufficiently as far as public health is concerned. The lack of public health risk assessment at EU level leads to discrepancies in evaluating the danger of a given threat, duplication of assessments between Member States and inconsistent measures at EU level. Such a situation can also lead to inefficient use of the limited resources currently available. Although the Member States have the responsibility to manage public health crises at national level, no country can tackle a cross border public health crisis on its own. At EU level, the legal basis for addressing serious cross-border health threats has been reinforced with the Lisbon Treaty. The EU can now take action in this field that complement and support national policies and encourage cooperation between Member States. This is the reason why it is proposed to create a new instrument to step up cooperation and strengthen coordination in the area of the notification and risk assessment. The aim is to streamline and strengthen European Union capacities and structures for effectively responding to serious cross-border health threats. These threats can be events caused by communicable diseases, biological agents responsible for non-communicable diseases, and threats of chemical, environmental, or unknown origin, as well as threats deriving from the effects of climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: The Commission has carried out detailed analysis of three options: Option 1 : status quo: maintaining the current level of activities; Option 2: separate and different handling of serious cross-border threats to health - enhanced EU cooperation through the use of soft instruments based on a voluntary approach; Option 3 : establishing a common EU legal framework covering all serious cross-border threats to health through improved cooperation and legally binding measures. The results of the analysis led to the conclusion that option 3 has the strongest positive health impacts as it improves the protection of citizens against serious cross-border threats to health. LEGAL BASIS: Article 168, paragraphs (4)(c) and (5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal lays down the rules on monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health, as well as on preparedness and response planning related to those activities. It aims to support the prevention and control of the spread of severe human diseases across the borders of the Member States, and to obviate other major sources of serious cross-border threat to health in order to contribute to a high level of public health protection in the Union. Scope : the proposal applies in case of serious cross-border threats to health falling within the following categories: threats of biological origin, consisting of: (i) communicable diseases; (ii) antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections related to communicable diseases; (iii) biotoxins or other toxic biological agents not related to communicable diseases; threats of chemical origin with the exception of threats arising from ionizing radiation; threats of environmental origin, including threats deriving from the effects of climate change; threats of unknown origin; events which may constitute public health emergencies of international concern determined pursuant to the International Health Regulations (2005). General structure : the monitoring system revolves around the following four fields: 1) preparedness and response planning : the proposal provides for the coordination of the efforts of the Member States in terms of improved preparedness and capacity building. To this end, the Commission will ensure coordination between national planning and between key sectors such as transport, energy and civil protection, and will support Member States in setting up a joint procurement mechanism for medical countermeasures, e.g. vaccines against influenza, which would enable the EU to be better prepared for future pandemics; 2) establishment of an epidemiological monitoring network: to provide the relevant information and data for risk assessment and monitoring of emerging threats, an ad hoc network will be set up in situations where a Member State has raised an alert on a serious threat other than a communicable disease. Communicable diseases will continue to be monitored as they are today; 3) the use of the existing Early Warning and Response System to cover all serious threats to health, and not only communicable diseases as is the case today; 4) coordinated development of national or European public health risk assessments for threats of biological, chemical, environmental or unknown origin in a crisis situation. EU response to a public health crisis: the proposal sets up a coherent framework for the EU response to a public health crisis. In concrete terms, by formalising the existing Health Security Committee, the EU will be in a better position to coordinate national crisis responses in a public health emergency. A procedure for the mobilisation and coordination of the European response to a serious cross-border risk is proposed. Thus, if a Member State intends to adopt public health measures to combat a serious cross-border health risk, it shall, before adopting any measures consult the other Member States and the Commission on the nature, purpose and scope of the measures. The measures taken shall be decided by means of implementing acts. Provision is also made for the following specific measures: Common temporary public health measures to control the spread of a serious cross-border threat to health between the Member States or to the Union as a whole; Emergency and pandemic influenza situations at the Union level ; International agreements with third countries or international organisations. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this legal proposal does not impact on decentralised agencies. In addition, the current EU health programme already covers some activities in relation to monitoring, alerting and risk assessment of some health threats. After 2013, the Commission intends to cover these activities under the proposed Health for growth programme 2014-2020. The cost is included in the proposed envelope of the new programme. DELEGATED ACTS: in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of measures needed to complement the action of the Member States, in very specific and urgent situations, for the transnational aspects of the control of serious cross-border threats to health. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts in relation to: the procedures for the coordination, the exchange of information and the mutual consultation on preparedness and response planning; the adoption of a list of communicable diseases subject to the network of epidemiological surveillance and the procedures for the operation of such a network; the setting up and termination of ad hoc monitoring networks and the procedures for the operation of such networks; the adoption of case definitions for serious cross-border threats to health; the procedures for the operation of the Early Warning and Response System; the procedures for the coordination of the responses of the Member States; the recognition of situations of emergency at Union level or of pre-pandemic situations with respect to human influenza at Union level."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. It is applied by all Member States with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries. The first series of visa waiver agreements were signed on 6 May 2015 (United Arab Emirates), 26 May 2015 (Timor-Leste) and 28 May 2015 (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu) and provisionally apply from the date of signature pending their entry into force. The Council has authorised the signature of a second series of visa waiver agreements with Tonga (signed on 20 November 2015), Colombia (signed on 2 December 2015), Kiribati (date of signature to be determined) and Palau (signed on 7 December 2015). These four agreements provisionally apply from the day following the date of signature pending their entry into force. The negotiations with the Marshall Islands were opened on 17 December 2014. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 11 December 2015 (Marshall Islands) and 13 January 2016 (Union). The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Marshall Islands on the short-stay visa waiver. The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the Marshall Islands when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of the Marshall Islands to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that the Marshall Islands may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For those travelling to carry out a paid activity, each Member State and also the Marshall Islands remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. A joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of the Marshall Islands to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. A joint declaration on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis is annexed to the agreement. Lastly, the Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council (on a recommendation from the European Central Bank). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 129(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, and on a recommendation from the ECB or a proposal from the Commission, to amend Article 22 of the Statute of the ESCB. The General Court considered it would be for the ECB to request the European Union legislature to amend Article 22, should the ECB consider that having the power to regulate CCPs is necessary for the proper performance of the task referred to in the fourth indent of Article 127(2) of the Treaty, namely to promote the proper functioning of payment systems. The ECB notes that developments at both global and European level are expected to increase the risks posed by clearing systems, in particular central counterparties, for the proper functioning of payment systems and the implementation of the single monetary policy, which would ultimately affect the Eurosystem’s primary objective of maintaining price stability: firstly, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have a major impact on the Eurosystem’s ability to carry out its tasks as central bank of issue for the euro. At present, CCPs established in the United Kingdom clear significant volumes of euro-denominated transactions. Thus, a significant disturbance affecting a major UK CCP could lead to a severe decrease in liquidity within the euro area; secondly, at the September 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, G20 leaders agreed that all standardised OTC derivative contracts should be cleared through a CCP. These developments have led to a dramatic increase in the scale and importance of CCPs in the Union and globally; thirdly, the European Commission presented its legislative proposal to ensure financial stability and the safety and soundness of CCPs that are of systemic relevance for financial markets across the Union. In order to ensure that the Eurosystem as central bank of issue for the euro can carry out the role envisaged by the legislative proposal, it should have the power to monitor and assess risks posed by CCPs clearing significant amounts of euro-denominated transactions. In the light of these considerations, the ECB considers that it should have the power to regulate clearing systems, in particular central counterparties, in order to fulfil its fundamental tasks. It therefore submits a recommendation for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council with a view to amending Article 22 of the Statute of the ESCB in this respect. CONTENT: the ECB recommends that Parliament and the Council adopt a decision amending Article 22 of the ESCB Statute on clearing and payments systems in order to allow the ECB and the national central banks to provide facilities, and to enable the ECB to make regulations, and ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems, and clearing systems for financial instruments, within the Union and with other countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement was adopted according to the objectives defined in the Commission’s communication “ Global Europe - Competing in the world ”, which describes how the EU's trade policy can contribute to achieving the European strategy for growth and employment. This underlined that the Doha programme for development remains the EU’s main priority. The communication also stressed the importance for the EU of using the framework provided by the WTO as the best way of opening up markets to trade and investment. It proposed a series of trade policy initiatives to complement efforts to relaunch WTO negotiations. Among these, it proposed the negotiation of carefully selected and prioritised free trade agreements (FTAs). Following the adoption of negotiating guidelines by the Council, on 23 April 2007, negotiations with Korea began in Seoul on 6 May 2007. These were completed with the initialling of the FTA, in Brussels, on 15 October 2009, after less than two and a half years of discussions. Parliament was kept informed regularly on the progress of the discussions by its Committee on International Trade (INTA). On 13 December 2007, Parliament adopted a resolution on economic and trade relations with Korea, which served as an important contribution to the negotiations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in preparation for the negotiations, the Commission undertook and impact assessment to examine the potential impact of an FTA with South Korea. A more detailed evaluation of the impact of trade on sustainable development, examining the potential effects of the agreement in the economic, social and environmental fields was carried out in parallel with the negotiations. Additional studies, to analyse the FTA from both a quantitative and quantitative point of view, were also undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Articles 91, 100(2) and 207, in conjunction with Article 218(6) a) v) of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal represents the legal instrument enabling the conclusion of the FTA between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and South Korea, on the other. The purpose of the agreement is to establish a progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services and to define rules on matters relating to trade. Commercial aspects: the EU-Korea FTA sets down the measures needed to establish a free trade area in accordance with the provisions of Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994). The two parties agreed to implement very rapidly the commitments to liberalise and will eliminate 98.7% of customs duties, in trade value, both for the industrial sector and for agriculture in the coming five years. The remaining customs duties will be eliminated almost entirely over longer transitional periods, with the exception of a small number of agricultural products, such as rice or garlic. Sectoral Annexes have been negotiated on electronics, motor vehicles and their parts, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, as well as chemicals with a view to the dismantling of non-tariff barriers. The FTA included the following distinct chapters covering: Electronic Commerce (with schedules of undertakings in this matter which clearly go beyond the commitments made by each party under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and that comply with Article V of the GATS) Competition and commercial compliance aspects: in terms of rules, the FTA defines ambitious commitments in the field of competition and, in particular: intellectual property (including the enforcement of these rules), More ambitious restrictive horizontal measures in regard to regulatory transparency in areas of importance for mutual trade and investment between the parties were also incorporated in the agreement. Separate protocols: the FTA includes various protocols, including a protocol on rules of origin and one concerning mutual administrative assistance in customs matters, which include provisions defining the origin of products - a concept that is used to determine the duties applicable to traded products – governing the proof of origin and laying down the practical details of cooperation between the customs authorities. It also includes a specific protocol on cooperation in the cultural field, which defines the terms of a strategic dialogue and cooperation to facilitate cultural exchanges. It also provides an institutional framework for implementation independent of that provided in the FTA itself , with the creation a separate committee and a specific mechanism for dispute resolution. Trade and sustainable development aspects: this section covers social and environmental aspects. It includes provisions on cooperation and establishes a novel monitoring mechanism involving civil society by means of a “forum of civil society”. Institutional aspects: institutional arrangements provide for the establishment of the Trade Committee, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the FTA and to examine how to further strengthen trade relations between the parties. An effective dispute resolution mechanism is provided for. The Trade Committee will comprise representatives of the EU and Korea. It will report on its activities and those of its committees, working groups and other specialized bodies to the Joint Committee established by the Framework Agreement. The updated framework agreement, coupled with the free trade agreement, reflects a new dimension of relations between the EU and Korea. At the request of the Council, the two agreements are legally and institutionally linked. Provisional application: until the entry into force, this provides for its provisional application. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no financial impact on the Union’s expenditure, but has a financial impact on its revenues."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC established an EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). It is aimed at tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient way. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The ‘Fit for 55’ package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. As part of this package, this proposal introduces an amendment to aviation rules in the Emissions Trading System of the European Union (EU ETS) to implement Member States’ notification to EU-based airlines of the offsetting for the year 2021 under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). CONTENT: with this proposal decision, the Commission seeks to phase out free emission allowances for aviation and align with the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in a way that is consistent with the EU’s 2030 climate objectives. The EU ETS Directive would thus allow the CORSIA scheme to be applied to emissions from EU-based airlines for flights to and from countries outside the EEA. The objective is to implement this notification in a manner that minimises the administrative burden of national authorities and airline operators, and provides legal certainty as regards CORSIA offsetting by airlines based in Member States. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, aviation CO2 emissions in the EU ETS have decreased by 64% in 2020 compared to 2019. Aviation emissions are unlikely to exceed their 2019 levels in 2021. Therefore, the additional compensation for aircraft operators is expected to be zero for the year 2021. However, the proposed decision provides that Member States should implement the CORSIA scheme by notifying aircraft operators based in those Member States of their compensation for the year 2021 by 30 November 2022."
9039EP8,"""""Minimum requirements for water reuse""""",0.157,0.919,0.9,0.896,0.192,0.955,0.885,0.827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to contribute to alleviating water scarcity across the EU, in particular by increasing the uptake of water reuse, in particular for agricultural irrigation. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a third of the EU's land suffers from water stress all year round and water scarcity remains an important concern for many EU Member States. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, including severe droughts, are also likely to have negative consequences on both the quantity and quality of freshwater resources. Between 1976 and 2006, the number of areas and people affected by droughts went up by almost 20% and the total costs of droughts amounted to EUR 100 billion (EC, 2012). Agricultural irrigation by far is the largest application of reused water worldwide and in Europe and a significant use of water in Europe, overall accounting for around a quarter of total freshwater abstracted. By encouraging the reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation, the EU could therefore improve its capacity to respond to increasing pressures on water resources. The need to address the problem at EU level has been acknowledged in the 2012 Commission Communication ‘A Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources’. A Fitness check of EU Freshwater policy published in November 2012 as a building block of the Blueprint, concluded that ‘alternative water supply options with low environmental impact need to be further relied upon’ in order to address water scarcity. Furthermore, the European Parliament, in its September 2015 Resolution on the follow-up to the European Citizens’ Initiative Right2Water encouraged the Commission to draw up a legislative framework on water reuse. Two instruments in force in the Union encourage the reuse of water, without however specifying the conditions in this respect. These are the Water Framework Directive ( 2000/60/EC ) and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option for agricultural irrigation is a legal instrument with a ‘fit for purpose’ approach (minimum requirements set depending on the food crop category and irrigation technique) and protection of local public health and of the environment (the key risk management tasks). It is estimated that the proposed instrument could lead to 6.6 billion m3 of water per year being reused for agricultural irrigation, compared to 1.7 billion m3 if the EU did not establish a legal framework. CONTENT: the Regulation proposed by the Commission aims to mitigate water shortages in the EU, in the context of adaptation to climate change. It would ensure that treated waste water for agricultural irrigation is safe, protecting people and the environment. More specifically, the proposal: defines the minimum water quality and monitoring requirements to be met and the obligation to perform certain essential risk management tasks in order to enable the safe reuse of urban waste water as part of integrated water management. These requirements should consist of a minimum of parameters for reclaimed water and other stricter or additional quality requirements, imposed, if necessary, by the competent authorities together with appropriate preventive measures; defines the process of risk management that should be carried out by the operator of a reclamation plant in cooperation with relevant parties (the end-user of the reclaimed water, the urban waste water treatment plant supplying water to the reclamation plant, etc.). The reclamation plant operator shall elaborate a water reuse risk management plan identifying additional requirements to further mitigate risks, which would be part of a permit issued by the competent authority; ensure transparency and access to information in order to increase user and public confidence in the safety of reused water: the public will have access to information online about water reuse practice in their Member States. With regard to access to justice, it should be possible for citizens and NGOs to legally review the decisions taken by Member States under this Regulation. The proposed Regulation sets the date of entry into force and the date of application, i.e. one year after the date of entry into force in order to provide sufficient time to the Member States to adapt to the Regulation, as well as to elaborate an implementing act ensuring the uniform application of the risk management."
6011EP7,"""""Trans-European telecommunications networks""""",0.754,0.846,0.035,0.581,0.303,0.892,0.831,0.571,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to present an amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks and repealing Decision No 1336/97/EC. BACKGROUND: On 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted the Communication ""A Budget for Europe 2020"" on the next multi-annual financial framework (MFF) (2014-2020), which proposes the creation of a Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to promote the completion of priority energy, transport and digital infrastructures with a single fund of EUR 40 billion, out of which the Commission proposed that EUR 9.2 billion are be dedicated to digital networks and services. On 8 February 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions on a new MFF setting the budget for ""CEF Digital"" at EUR 1 billion. On this basis, the Commission now proposes to modify its proposal for a Regulation on guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks. At the time of writing, the negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament on the next Multiannual Financial Framework have not yet been concluded. Likewise, negotiations on the proposal for a Regulation establishing the CEF are on-going. CONTENT: the modified proposal takes, to the extent possible, account of the latest positions in the Council and in the relevant European Parliament committee. It aims to focus the CEF intervention on a smaller number of digital service infrastructures, based on a stringent set of criteria for prioritisation, and a limited contribution to broadband via financial instruments, with a view to leverage private investment as well as investment from public sources other than CEF. Despite its limited financial contribution regarding broadband, the proposal sets a framework enabling wider contributions from business and institutional players such as the European Investment Bank. Hence, CEF will only be able to finance a limited number of broadband projects by itself, but in addition it will facilitate the efficient allocation of, for example, European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), by enabling Managing Authorities to make a contribution from the operational programmes. For digital service infrastructures , taking account of the proposed budgetary restrictions, two services have been not been a retained in the annex of this proposal (""Trans-European high-speed backbone connections for public administrations"", ""Information and communication technology solutions for intelligent energy networks and for the provision of Smart Energy Services""), while one general service infrastructure has been added The European Parliament's Industry, Research and Energy Committee added additional digital service infrastructures on ""Deployment of infrastructures in public transports allowing the use of secure and interoperable mobile proximity services"", ""Online Dispute Resolution Platform"", ""European Platform for Access to Educational Resources"", and ""Cross border interoperable electronic invoicing services"". Some of them are retained in the annex of the present proposal. In the area of broadband , the present proposal foresees the setting up of financial instruments with a view to providing an efficient way to allocate, inter alia, structural funds. Both Council and Parliament shared the view that the intervention should not displace private investment and that it should be based on the principle of technological neutrality. By insisting that EU funds be prioritised to state-of-the art technologies, while giving Member States flexibility in the choice of projects in their countries that would benefit from access to long term funds, the present proposal reaffirms the link to the Digital Agenda targets, while retaining the spirit of preferences expressed by both institutions. On the method of intervention , i.e. grants or financial instruments (loans, guarantees, project bonds, equity), the present proposal only provides for the setting up of financial instruments, as sources of efficiently priced long term funds, aligned to the infrastructure needs. Lastly, on horizontal points , the original Commission proposal foresaw Delegated Act powers to amend the list of Projects of Common Interest in the Annex. The present proposal takes account of the concerns expressed in particular by Member States, and instead foresees sufficiently flexible wording in the Annex, and recognises that the necessary programme adjustments will be made by Implementing Act. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the final amount allocated to telecommunications will be known once the political agreement on the MFF figures will be reached and the new legal base is adopted by the Legislative Authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (POPs Regulation) implements the Union's commitments under the Stockholm Convention on POPs, approved by Council Decision 2006/507/EC, and the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants, approved by Council Decision 2004/259/EC. All POP substances are recognised to have adverse, generally long-term effects upon living organisms . They persist for a very long time in the environment and in our bodies and can be transported unchanged to almost any remote point of the globe, far away from where they were produced or used. Management of POP waste, including its recycling where this is possible, should be carried out in an environmentally sound manner, with minimal impact on human health and the environment. It should also minimise the extent to which toxic substances are released into the environment, and thus contribute to the zero-pollution ambition by reducing their environmental and health impact. CONTENT: the proposal aims to implement, for the substances within its scope, the EU’s international obligations under the Stockholm Convention and, more specifically, those derived from the POPs Regulation. The proposed update brings Annexes IV and V of the Regulation into line with the Stockholm Convention and Annex I of the POPs Regulation by aligning them with the substances listed therein and by introducing concentration limits for these substances. Taking into account the amendments made to the Stockholm Convention on 15 May 2015 and in order to ensure that waste containing these substances is managed in accordance with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention, the Commission proposes to amend Annexes IV and V of Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 by including pentachlorophenol, dicofol and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), its salts and PFOA-related compounds in the Annexes and indicating their corresponding concentration limits. It is also proposed to amend the concentration limits set out in Annex IV for the following substances to adapt their limit values to scientific and technical progress: tetrabromodiphenyl ether, pentabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromodiphenyl ether, heptabromodiphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromocyclododecane, alkanes C10-C13, chloro (short-chain chlorinated paraffins), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF). Lastly, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dioxin-like PCBs) should be included in the existing group entry for Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) in Annexes IV and V of the POP Regulation. The proposal is consistent with the objective of ensuring an optimal balance with the Green Deal for Europe's ambitions to achieve toxic-free material cycles, increasing recycling and circularity and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."
1257EP7,"""""European Protection Order""""",0.053,0.908,0.93,0.548,0.394,0.916,0.877,0.829,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down rules regarding the European Protection Order and in particular to ensure that the protection provided to a person in one Member State is continued in any other Member State to which the person moves. PROPOSED ACT: Initiative of Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Finland and Sweden for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 82(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) provides that judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Union shall be based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions. According to the Stockholm programme, adopted by the European Council at its meeting in December 2009, mutual recognition could extend to all types of judgments and decisions of a judicial nature, which may, depending on the legal system, be either criminal or administrative. The programme also underlines that victims of crime can be offered special protection measures which should be effective within the Union. The resolution of the European Parliament of 2 February 2006 on the current situation in combating violence against women and any future actions recommends that Member States formulate a zero-tolerance policy as regards all forms of violence against women and calls on Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure better protection of and support to actual and potential victims. In a common area of justice without internal borders, it is necessary to ensure that the protection provided to a person in one Member State is continued in any other Member State to which the person moves. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: various policy options have been examined: · Option A : No new action to be taken in the European Union. · Option B : Non-legislative measures , whose basic aim would be to establish a mechanism for exchanging information and good practices. · Option C : Legislative proposals to amend Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions, and Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA on the application between Member States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention. Amended versions of those Framework Decisions could incorporate a protection mechanism for those cases where it is the victim who moves to a State other than the one which adopted the measure. · Option D : Legislative proposal comprising a single text covering all scenarios relating to the extension of victim protection. In the light of the impact assessment, the repercussions for fundamental rights and the need to have an effective victim protection instrument at European level, options C and D offer the best ways to deal with the issue and could meet the objectives identified in full. The preferred option would be option D in the light of the legislative consequences of existing instruments, the need for clarity when applying new legislative texts and the usefulness of having a legislative text specifically designed to deal with victim protection across borders. CONTENT : this Directive sets out rules whereby the protection stemming from a protection measure adopted according to the law of one Member State (""the issuing State"") can be extended to another Member State to which the protected person moves (""the executing State""), regardless of the type or duration of the obligations or prohibitions contained in the protection measure concerned. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: ""European protection order "" is defined as a judicial decision relating to a protection measure issued by a Member State and aiming at facilitating the taking by another Member State, where appropriate, of a protection measure under its own national law with a view to the safeguard of the life, physical and psychological integrity, freedom or sexual integrity of a person. Scope of the European protection order : a European protection order may be issued at any moment when the protected person intends to leave or has left the issuing State for another Member State. It shall only be issued when a protection measure has been previously adopted in the issuing State, imposing on the person causing danger one or more of the following obligations or prohibitions: · an obligation not to enter certain localities, places or defined areas where the protected person resides or that he visits; · an obligation to remain in a specified place, where applicable during specified times; · an obligation containing limitations on leaving the territory of the issuing State; · an obligation to avoid contact with the protected person; or · a prohibition on approaching the protected person closer than a prescribed distance. Obligation to recognise the European protection order : Member States must recognise any European protection order in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. The latter shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the TEU. Designation of competent authorities : each Member State must inform the Council which judicial authority or authorities are competent under its national law to issue a European protection order and to recognise such an order, when that Member State is the issuing State or the executing State. Member States may designate non-judicial authorities as the competent authorities for taking decisions under the Directive, provided that such authorities have the competence to take decisions of a similar nature under their national law and procedures. Issue of a European protection order : on the basis of a protection measure adopted in the issuing State, a judicial authority of that State, or another competent authority as above, shall, only at the request of the protected person, issue a European protection order, after verifying that the protection measure meets all the requirements set out in the text. The protected person or his legal representative may submit a request for the issuance of a European protection order either to the competent authority of the issuing State or to the competent authority of the executing State. If such a request is submitted in the executing State, its competent authority shall transfer this request as soon as possible to the competent authority of the issuing State in order to issue the order. Form and content : the European protection order will be in accordance with the form set out in Annex I to the Directive. The information it must contain is prescribed in the text and includes the identity and nationality of the protected person, a summary of the facts and circumstances which have led to the imposition of the protection measure in the issuing State, and the identity and nationality of the person causing a danger. Transmission procedure : the text states that where the competent authority of the issuing State transmits the European protection order to the competent authority of the executing State, it shall do so by any means which leaves a written record so as to allow the competent authority of the executing Member State to establish its authenticity. Measures in the executing State : the proposal describes the series of actions that must be taken in the executing State, including informing the person causing danger, where appropriate, of any measure taken in the executing State. Grounds for non-recognition of a European protection order : these include the following: the European protection order is not complete or has not been completed within the time-limit set by the competent authority of the executing State; the requirements set out in Article 2 on scope have not been met; the protection derives from the execution of a penalty or measure that is covered by amnesty according to the law of the executing State and relates to an act which falls within its competence according to that law; there is immunity conferred under the law of the executing State on the person causing danger, which makes it impossible to adopt the protection measures; Subsequent decisions in the issuing State: the issuing State will have jurisdiction to take all subsequent decisions relating to the protection measure underlying a European protection order, notably the renewal, review and withdrawal of the protection measure, and the initiation of new criminal proceedings against the person causing the danger. Grounds for revoking the recognition of a European protection order : this may happen where there is evidence that the protected person has definitively left the territory of the executing State. Governing law: decisions made by the competent authority of the executing State shall be governed by its national law. Languages: the European protection order shall be translated into the official language or one of the official languages of the executing State. Costs: costs resulting from the application of the Directive shall be borne by the executing State, except for costs arising exclusively within the territory of the issuing State. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this proposal for a Directive will not impose any major additional expenditure on Member States' budgets or, as already stated, on the European Union budget. In the long term, the costs which it may involve, relating mainly to the translation of the European Protection Order, will in many instances represent savings by preventing the commission of new offences against the victim, that being the primary objective of this proposal."
2528EP7,"""""Deposit guarantee schemes""""",0.035,0.78,0.754,0.323,0.303,0.711,0.764,0.571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to recast provisions on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: events in 2007 and 2008 showed that the existing, fragmented DGS system has not delivered on the objectives set by Directive 94/19/EC on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS), in terms of maintaining depositors’ confidence and financial stability in times of economic stress. The current about 40 DGS in the EU, which cover different groups of depositors and deposits up to different coverage levels, impose different financial obligations on banks and therefore limit the benefits of the internal market for banks and depositors. Moreover, schemes have proved to be underfinanced in times of financial stress. Directive 2009/14/EC was adopted as an emergency measure to maintain depositors’ confidence, in particular by increasing the coverage level from EUR 20 000 to EUR 100 000 by the end of 2010. Directive 2009/14/EC contained a clause providing for a broad review of all aspects of DGSs. The need to reinforce DGSs by presenting appropriate legislative proposals was reiterated in the Commission communication of 4 March 2009 Driving European recovery . This proposal is part of a package on guarantee schemes in the financial sector, which also comprises a review of investor compensation schemes (Directive 97/9/EC) and a White Paper on insurance guarantee schemes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: altogether, over 70 different policy options were assessed. The main options identified as preferable are: (a) simplifying and harmonising the scope of coverage; (b) reducing the payout deadline to seven days; (c) ending the practice of setting off depositors’ liabilities against their claims; (d) introducing an information template to be countersigned by a depositor and a mandatory reference to DGSs in account statements and advertisements; (e) harmonising the approach to the funding of DGSs; (f) setting a target level for DGS funds; (g) fixing the proportions of ex-ante and ex-post bank contributions to DGS; (i) introducing risk-based elements for bank contributions to DGS; (j) restricting the use of DGS funds for broader bank resolution purposes benefiting of all creditors of a bank; (k) having the host country DGS act as a single point of contact for depositors at branches in another Member State. In terms of social impact, the proposal provides that, in the event of a bank failure, depositors are reimbursed up to EUR 100 000 by a DGS within seven calendar days. This will make the intervention of social welfare systems almost unnecessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 53(1) TFEU. CONTENT: the main elements of this proposal are: simplification and harmonisation, in particular as to the scope of coverage and the arrangements for payout; further reduction of the time limit for paying out depositors and better access for DGS to information about their members (i.e. banks); sound and credible DGSs that are sufficiently financed; mutual borrowing between DGSs, i.e. a borrowing facility in certain circumstances. The elements of the review which, in the Commission’s view, should not be subject to legislation are set out in the report accompanying this proposal (please see COM(2010)0369). The report and the proposal are part of a package on guarantee schemes in the financial sector, which also comprises a review of investor compensation schemes (see COD/2010/0199) and a White Paper on insurance guarantee schemes. The main points are as follows: Scope: the Directive now encompasses all credit institutions and all schemes, without distinction. All banks must join a DGS. This ensures that depositors always have a claim against a scheme and that all schemes must be soundly financed. Mutual guarantee schemes protect depositors by protecting the credit institution itself. Since all banks must now join a DGS, mutual guarantee schemes can either be recognised as DGSs and meet the requirements set out in Directive 2006/48/EC, or be set up separately. In this case, a dual membership of a bank in both schemes and the additional safeguard role of mutual schemes can be taken into account when the contributions to the DGS are set. Definitions: deposits are now defined more clearly. Only entirely repayable instruments can be deemed deposits, not structured products, certificates or bonds. This prevents DGSs from taking unpredictable risks with investment products. Supervision: all DGSs must now be supervised on a continual basis and they must perform regular stress tests of their systems. DGSs now have the right to obtain information from banks at an early stage in order to enable fast payout. Member States are now explicitly allowed to merge their DGSs. Credit institutions now have to be given one month’s notice, not 12 months’, before they can be excluded from a DGS. Eligibility criteria and determination of the repayable amount : depositors’ eligibility has been simplified and harmonised. Most discretionary exclusions have become mandatory, in particular the exclusion of authorities and financial institutions of any kind. On the other hand, deposits in non-EU currencies are covered under the law and so are the deposits of all non-financial companies. The coverage level of EUR 100 000 (to be implemented by end of 2010 under Directive 2009/14/EC) has not been amended. However, Member States may decide to cover deposits arising from real estate transactions and deposits relating to particular life events above the limit of EUR 100 000 , provided that the coverage is limited to 12 months. It is now stipulated that interest due but not credited at the time of failure must be repaid, provided that the coverage level is not exceeded. Depositors must now be paid out in the currency in which the account was managed. Setting off claims against the depositor’s liabilities is no longer permitted after an institution fails. Payout: the DGS must now act to repay depositors within one week. Depositors do not need to submit an application. Any information they are given must be in the official language(s) of the Member State where the deposit is located. The Directive now stipulates that depositors’ unacknowledged or unpaid claims against DGS can only be time-barred to the extent that the DGS’s claims in the liquidation proceedings are time-barred. In order to meet such a short payout deadline, the competent authorities are obliged to inform DGSs by default if a bank failure becomes likely. Moreover, DGSs and banks must exchange information on depositors, domestically and across borders, unfettered by confidentiality requirements. Credit institutions must also be in a position to provide the aggregated deposits of a depositor (‘single customer view’) at any time. DGS financing and borrowing between DGS : the Directive now ensures that DGSs’ available financial means are proportionate to their potential liabilities. These financial means are safeguarded against potential losses by restrictions on investment similar to those for electronic money institutions under Directive 2009/110/EC and UCITS under Directive 2009/64/EC, taking into account the need for lower risk and higher liquidity. The financing of DGS will be based on the following subsequent steps: step 1: in order to ensure sufficient funding, DGSs must have 1.5 % of eligible deposits on hand after a transition period of 10 years (this is referred to as the ‘target level’). If these financial means turn out to be insufficient in the event of a bank failure, the second and third steps below must be taken; step 2: banks must pay extraordinary (‘ex-post’) contributions of up to 0.5 % of eligible deposits if necessary. Consequently, ex-ante funds will account for 75 % of DGSs’ financing and ex-post contributions 25 %; step 3: a mutual borrowing facility allows a DGS in need to borrow from all other DGSs in the EU, which, altogether, must, if needed, lend to the DGS a maximum of 0.5 % of its eligible deposits in need on short notice, proportionate to the amount of eligible deposits in each country. The loan must be repaid within five years and new contributions to the DGS must be raised to reimburse the loan. To secure repayment, the lending DGSs have the right to subrogate into the claims of depositors against the failed credit institution and these claims will rank first in the liquidation procedure of the credit institution whose failure depleted the borrowing DGS; step 4 : as a last line of defence against taxpayers’ involvement, DGSs must have in place alternative funding arrangements, recalling that those arrangements must comply with the monetary financing prohibition laid down in Article 123 TFEU. This four-step mechanism will become fully operational only after 10 years. In order to adapt the target level to schemes’ potential liabilities, it will be recalibrated on the basis of covered deposits (i.e. taking into account the coverage level), but without diminishing the level of protection. DGS funds should principally be used for paying out depositors. This, however, does not prevent their use for bank resolution purposes in accordance with state aid rules. However, to avoid the depletion of funds for the benefit of a bank’s uninsured creditors, such use must be limited to the amount that would have been necessary to pay out covered deposits. Given that bank resolution and payout have different purposes, DGS funds should be ring-fenced already when the target level is build up, ensuring that the primary function of DGSs, i.e. deposit payout, is not impeded. Risk-based contributions to DGSs: contributions from credit institutions to DGSs must be calculated according to their risk profiles in a harmonised way. In principle, contributions consist of both non-risk and risk-based elements. The latter will be calculated on the basis of several indicators reflecting the risk profiles of each credit institution. The proposed indicators cover the key risk classes commonly used to evaluate the financial soundness of credit institutions: capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability and liquidity. The data necessary to compute those indicators are available under existing reporting obligations. Taking into account differences between banking sectors in Member States, the Directive ensures some flexibility by developing a set of core indicators (mandatory for all Member States) and another set of supplementary indicators (optional for Member States). The core indicators consist of commonly used criteria such as capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability and liquidity. Core indicators weigh 75 % and supplementary indicators 25 %. In general, the Directive requires that the total amount of contributions to be collected by DGS should first be determined in line with the target level for DGS funds; then the amount should be apportioned among DGS member banks according to their risk profiles. Consequently, the Directive provides incentives for sound risk management and discourages risky behaviour by clearly differentiating between the levels of contribution paid by the least and most risky banks (from 75 % to 200 % of the standard amount, respectively). As to the non-risk element, the contribution base is the amount of eligible deposits, as is currently the case in most Member States. However, over time, covered deposits (i.e. eligible deposits not exceeding the coverage level) will become the contribution base in all Member States as they better reflect the risk to which DGSs are exposed. A full harmonisation of the calculation of risk-based contributions should be achieved at a later stage. Cross-border cooperation: in order to facilitate the payout process in cross-border situations, the host country DGS acts as a single point of contact for depositors at branches in another Member State. This includes not only communication with depositors in that country (acting as a ‘post box’) but also paying out on behalf of the home country DGS (acting as a ‘paying agent’). Agreements between DGSs will facilitate this function. Schemes have to exchange relevant information with each other. Mutual agreements will facilitate this. Banks reorganising themselves in a way that causes their membership of one DGS to cease and entails membership in another DGS will be reimbursed their last contribution so that they can use these funds to pay the first contribution to the new DGS. Depositor information : before making a deposit, depositors must now countersign an information sheet based on the template set out in the proposal, which contains all relevant information about the coverage of the deposit by the responsible DGS. Existing depositors must be informed accordingly on the statements of account. Advertising on deposit products must be limited to a factual reference to coverage by the DGS, in order to avoid using the DGS as a marketing argument. The regular disclosure of specific information by DGSs (ex-ante funds, ex-post capacity, results of regular stress testing) ensures transparency and credibility, leading to enhanced financial stability with insignificant costs. New supervisory architecture : o n 23 September 2009, the Commission adopted proposals for Regulations establishing the European System of Financial Supervisors, including the creation of the three European supervisory authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board. T he new European Banking Authority should collect information on the amount of deposits, conduct peer review analyses, confirm whether a DGS can borrow from other DGSs, and settle disagreements between DGSs. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while Member States are responsible for their health policies, the experience gained during the COVID-19 crisis has shown the need to significantly strengthen the EU's capacity to respond effectively to major health threats. Europe needs to give higher priority to health, to have health systems ready to provide state-of-the-art care and to be prepared to deal with epidemics and other unpredictable health threats, in line with the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Commission proposes that an ambitious stand-alone programme, called the EU4Health Programme, is the key instrument to implement this strategy. The new programme will be essential to ensure that the EU remains the healthiest region in the world, that it has all possible tools to address health challenges at national and European level and that it is ready to respond to any new and emerging health threats that may endanger the population of the EU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to establish a new programme for EU action in the field of health, entitled ‘EU4Health Programme’ (EU4Health) for the period 2021-2027. General objectives The Programme shall pursue the following general objectives: (1) protect people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health; (2) improve the availability in the Union of medicines, medical devices and other crisis relevant products, contribute to their affordability, and support innovation; (3) strengthen health systems and the healthcare workforce, including by digital transformation and by increased integrated and coordinated work among the Member States, sustained implementation of best practice and data sharing, to increase the general level of public health. From the point of view of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, the Programme should help to ensure that the EU is better prepared to deal with future health threats that would affect all or a large part of its territory. The Programme shall: - support Member States in the transition to better preparedness and the reinforcement of their health systems and support them in achieving the health-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); - set out key action areas such as improvement of national health systems, measures against communicable and non-communicable diseases, availability and affordability of medicines and other crisis relevant products; - address inequalities by benchmarking, providing support and closing identified gaps between countries, regions, population groups and citizens; - provide tools for enhanced solidarity in preparedness and crisis response, as well as in finding common ground to improve prevention and in addressing non-communicable diseases, and in particular cancer, and for better coordinating between different policies, tools and financial instruments; - contribute to tackling the negative impact of climate change and environmental degradation on human health; - support actions to enable the Commission to complement the necessary regulatory framework and contribute to addressing the significant structural needs identified in the COVID-19 crisis. Implementation The Programme shall be implemented through direct or indirect management and shall make use of the most commonly used spending mechanisms of the Union budget, including public procurement, prizes and grants. Funding for health under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027 includes several instruments such as the European Social Fund plus (ESF+), the European Regional Development Fund, the Horizon Europe Programme, the Digital Europe Programme and the Interconnection in Europe 2 mechanism. Working across programmes and sharing objectives between strategies will be key to channelling health funds between strategies and supporting the achievement of their objectives more effectively than before. Proposed budget The total budget allocated to the programme shall amount to EUR 10 397 614 000 (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027: - EUR 1 946 614 000 shall derive from heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’ of the MFF for the period 2021-2027; - EUR 8 451 000 000 shall derive from proceeds of the EU Recovery Instrument, constituting external assigned revenues."
5317EP7,"""""Credit agreements relating to residential property""""",0.228,0.916,0.842,0.613,0.303,0.904,0.923,0.029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to create an internal market in mortgage credit with a high level of consumer protection and to promote financial stability by ensuring that mortgage credit markets operate in a responsible manner. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the size of the EU mortgage market is significant: in 2008, outstanding residential mortgage lending in the EU27 amounted to almost EUR 6 trillion, or about 50% of EU GDP. The EU mortgage market is also of vital importance for the millions of European citizens currently repaying a mortgage and for would-be home owners. Rising household debt levels exist throughout Europe. A range of factors drive the decision to grant a particular mortgage credit, the borrower’s eventual choice of mortgage product and the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. These include the economic climate, information asymmetries and conflicts of interest, regulatory gaps and inconsistencies, as well as other factors such as the borrower’s financial literacy and mortgage financing structures. While these other factors clearly play a role, the fact remains that irresponsible behaviour by certain market actors contributed to a housing bubble and was one of the key features of the financial crisis. The financial crisis has had a substantial impact on EU citizens. Many consumers have lost confidence in the financial sector and certain lending practices that used to prevail are now having a direct impact.  Figures show that citizens are having increasing difficulties in meeting their debts. As borrowers have found their loans increasingly unaffordable, defaults and foreclosures have risen. Addressing irresponsible lending and borrowing is therefore an important element in financial reform efforts. For several years, the Commission has engaged in a comprehensive review of EU residential mortgages markets to ensure the efficient functioning of the single market. In 2007, the Commission adopted a White Paper on the integration of EU mortgage credit markets. In view of the problems brought to light in the financial crisis and in the context of efforts to ensure an efficient and competitive single market, the Commission undertook to come forward with measures on responsible lending and borrowing, including a reliable framework on credit intermediation.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an impact assessment which identified a series of problems in EU mortgage markets associated with irresponsible lending and borrowing at the pre-contractual stage and the potential scope for irresponsible behaviour by credit intermediaries and non-credit institutions. At the pre-contractual stage, the following problems were identified: non-comparable, unbalanced, incomplete and unclear advertising materials; insufficient, untimely, complex, non-comparable and unclear precontractual information; inappropriate advice; and inadequate suitability and creditworthiness assessments. Other problems highlighted include ineffective, inconsistent, or non-existent registration, authorisation and supervision regimes for credit intermediaries and non-credit institutions providing mortgage credit. Different options : the impact assessment considers a range of policy options for each problem area including no intervention, principles-based rules, and more detailed or specific rules at EU level. It also assesses the most appropriate instrument for measures, considering self-regulation, a Directive, a Regulation, a Communication and a Recommendation. The impact assessment concludes that a package of preferred policy options is necessary to ensure responsible lending and borrowing throughout the EU and that the preferred instrument is a Directive. The preferred policy options will also entail costs for creditors and credit intermediaries. However, these costs will be limited by several factors including the fact that a number of the preferred policy options are already implemented in several Member States, that many of the preferred policy options are already common practice amongst large parts of industry and that substantial synergies are expected between the different policy options. The estimated total benefits of the package of measures are in the range of EUR 1 272–1 931 million. The expected total one-off and ongoing costs are in the range of EUR 383-621 million and of EUR 268-330 million respectively. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of the proposed Directive is to create a responsible, efficient, healthy and competitive pan-European market that works to the benefit of consumers. It should also promote customer mobility, cross-border activity of creditors and intermediaries, and create a level playing field for all actors involved. The proposed Directive: requires Member States to designate specific competent authorities to implement the Directive; stipulates important conditions for both creditors and credit intermediaries in order to ensure a high degree of professionalism in the provision of mortgage credit, such as an obligation to act in the best interests of the consumer and requirements with regard to having appropriate knowledge and competence; introduces general principles for marketing and advertising communications and set out the form and content of information to be included in advertising. The standard information concerns key features of the credit and, when the credit is secured by a mortgage, a warning as to the consequences for the consumer in the event of non-observance of his commitments linked to the credit agreement; creates an obligation for creditors and credit intermediaries to make general information available on the range of credit products at all times. It further introduces an obligation for creditors and, where applicable, credit intermediaries to provide personalised information to the consumer on the basis of a European Standardised Information Sheet; requires credit intermediaries to disclose information to consumers concerning their identity, status, and relationship with the creditor, prior to the performance of their services in order to increase transparency of possible conflicts of interest; introduces an obligation for creditors and credit intermediaries to give explanations on the proposed credit agreement(s) to the consumer at the pre-contractual stage, determined by the level of the consumer’s knowledge and experience with credit; requires, for mortgage credit products, the use of the definition of the annual percentage rate of charge (APRC) used in Directive 2008/48/EC. Details of the APRC calculation method are given in Annex I and provisions for amending the methodology are laid down in order to be able to take market developments into account; provides for information to be delivered to the consumer in the event of changes to the borrowing rate; requires the creditor to assess the consumer’s ability to repay the credit, taking into account the consumer’s personal circumstances and based on sufficient information. It also introduces a duty for the creditor to refuse to grant the credit where the results of the creditworthiness assessment are negative; introduces the requirement for 'responsible borrowing', namely that the borrower must provide all necessary and correct information to enable the creditworthiness assessment to be carried out; introduces provisions to ensure that creditors are able to access information from relevant databases on a non-discriminatory basis; establishes standards to ensure that, where advice is given, it is clear to the borrower that advice is being provided, without introducing any obligation to provide advice; requires Member States to ensure that consumers have a right to repay their credit before the expiry of the credit agreement, giving freedom to Member States to set conditions on the exercise of that right, provided that such conditions are not excessively onerous; establish the principles for a regulatory and supervisory framework for credit intermediaries. This framework provides for the authorisation and registration of credit intermediaries, subject to compliance with certain requirements on entry into the business and on an ongoing basis, and for the establishment of a passport regime. The requirements apply to all credit intermediaries, whether they are tied or not in order to ensure a high degree of professionalism in the industry; stipulates that non-credit institutions must be subject to adequate authorisation, registration and supervision; requires Member States to ensure that appropriate administrative measures or sanctions can be taken in the case of non-compliance with the Directive; requires Member States to establish out-of-court redress bodies for the resolution of disputes between creditors and consumers and between credit intermediaries and consumers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: leaving aside the normal administrative costs linked to ensuring compliance with EU legislation, there will be no budgetary impact. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in order to take account of developments in the markets for credit relating to residential immovable property or in the evolution of credit products as well as economic developments, such as inflation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa entered into force on 21 May 2014 and became applicable as of 1 January 2014. Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management also entered into force on 21 May 2014 and became applicable as of 1 January 2014. Under Regulation (EU) No 515/2014, the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the Internal Security Fund ('the ISF –Borders and Visa'). This Fund aims to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation. This is the purpose of this Agreement with Iceland. CONTENT: with this proposed Council decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The aim of the draft Agreement with Iceland is to establish the arrangements for the participation of Iceland in the ISF – Borders and Visa and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. Protection of the EU’s financial interests: as regards budgetary and financial controls, the Member States are subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the Court of Auditors and of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)), derived either directly from the Treaty or from secondary Union legislation. These obligations must be extended to the associated country by means of the draft Agreement. In order to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities, Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 provides that cooperation agreements with third countries will expressly empower the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot controls and inspections. Territorial provisions: Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application. It will decide, within six months after the Council has adopted the proposal, whether it will implement the proposed Decision into its national law. The United Kingdom and Ireland are not participating in the adoption of this Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2000, the Union grants unlimited duty free access to the Union market for almost all products originating in the Western Balkans. Currently, this system is provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process. All the Western Balkans countries benefit from preferential trade arrangements, including individual tariff quotas, under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or Interim Agreements on trade and trade-related matters concluded with these countries, with the exception of Kosovo. Kosovo has no Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and can only benefit of the general tariff quota. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed to allocate a specific tariff quota of 20.000 hl to Kosovo, which is deducted from the global quota of 50.000 hl provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, hence reduced to 30.000 hl. This is achieved by closing the current tariff quota and establishing two new ones for the said amounts. A mechanism is foreseen which eliminates the legal uncertainties deriving from the fact that the quotas are allocated on a “first come–first served” basis, and that the date of entry into force of this regulation cannot be anticipated. In order to avoid expanding the overall volume of concessions, the quota reserved for Kosovo is applied on a pro-rata basis. This reallocation does not affect the global volume of concession to the countries in the Western Balkans, and maintains stable wine market conditions in the EU. The specific concessions provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements are also not affected by this proposed Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the European Union’s budget."

Parliament adopted its position at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure. The amendments adopted in plenary are the result of a compromise negotiated between the European Parliament and the Council. Under the compromise, the amendments to Articles 1 and 18 of the Agreement on establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which extends the geographic scope of EBRD operations have been approved on behalf of the European Union. Role of the Governor : as part of the annual report to the European Parliament, the Governor of the EBRD representing the Union shall also report on the EBRD's activities and operations in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. Transition : in the recitals, it is highlighted that the expansion of EBRD operations to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean reflects support by the Union and the international community for the hope, encouraged by the Arab Spring, for a transition in that region towards market economies and pluralistic democratic societies. Bearing in mind the fragility of the economies in the EBRD's new countries of operation and the social inequalities which were one of the root causes of the turmoil of the Arab Spring, the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should encourage the EBRD to: broaden its focus on private-sector development , in order also to contribute, through its financing, to the achievement of socially and environmentally sustainable societies, as elaborated in the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and in line with Article 3(5) and Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union; contribute to the transition towards energy-efficient, socially inclusive, open market economies while taking into account the social, poverty, civil and human rights context. Monitoring operations : the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should use their best endeavours to encourage the EBRD to monitor its operations closely, particularly in countries where there is a lack of political accountability, where civil and human rights are infringed or where high levels of corruption persist. Furthermore, the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should use their best endeavours to ensure that the principles of prudential banking, transparency and anti-fraud are taken into account in the activities of the EBRD in the new countries of operation. Approval of new countries : before the EBRD approves a potential new country of operation, it should make a detailed technical assessment of the economic and political conditions existing in the country concerned, including: an assessment of that country's commitment to principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics, as enshrined in Article 1 of the Agreement, an assessment of transition gaps, and a review of activities of other international financing institutions in that country and of the priorities in relation to which the EBRD could best make use of its unique knowledge and skills. In discussing those assessments, the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should encourage the EBRD to take full account of the views of the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extended for a period of 6 months (or 7 months in some cases) the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and postponed the completion of certain periodic checks and continuing training which, under the relevant EU legislation, should have taken place during the period between 1 March 2020 (or 1 February 2020 in some cases) and 31 August 2020. Some Member States have submitted reasoned requests to the Commission for authorisation to extend certain periods again. The Commission has adopted six decisions authorising such extensions. Despite some improvements in the situation during the summer of 2020, the persistence of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2020 forced Member States to maintain or even reinforce the measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. As a consequence, transport operators may not be able to complete the formalities or procedures necessary to comply with certain provisions of EU law on the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or approvals, or on the completion of periodic checks and continuous training, or to take other necessary steps to maintain their validity, as was the case in spring 2020. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to adopt measures to remedy these problems and to ensure both legal certainty and the proper functioning of the legal acts concerned. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and to the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in response to the exceptional situation arising from the spread of COVID-19 in the fields of road, rail and inland waterway transport and maritime security during reference periods subsequent to those referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698. The proposal provides for adaptations, in particular for certain time limits, as well as the possibility for the Commission to authorise extensions on the basis of a request submitted by any Member State by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Such extensions should be limited to what is necessary in view of the period during which the completion of formalities, procedures, checks and training are likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, should not exceed six months. The proposal concerns specific provisions which affect the application of several directives and regulations concerning in particular: - the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers for driving licences; - tachographs in road transport; - the periodic technical inspection of motor vehicles and their trailers; - the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; - access to the international road haulage market and access to the international market for coach and bus services; - railway safety, the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union and the rules establishing a single European railway area; - the conditions for obtaining boatmasters' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the Union, technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and the improvement of ship and port facility security. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency so that the situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors are minimised."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in June 2009, the Commission adopted a legislative proposal package to establish an Agency responsible for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (for more details, please refer to the summary dated 24 June 2009). The legislative package initially consisted of two proposals: a proposal for a Regulation establishing the Agency, and a proposal for a Council Decision conferring upon the Agency established by this Regulation tasks regarding the operational management of SIS II and VIS in application of Title VI of the EU Treaty. The proposed Regulation covered the SIS II, VIS and EURODAC to the extent they were governed by the EC Treaty. The proposed Decision covered the SIS II and VIS to the extent they were governed by the EU Treaty. Upon entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, the former distinction between EC Treaty and EU Treaty legal bases in the area of freedom, security and justice disappeared. Moreover, as notified to the European Parliament and to the Council by the Communication in December 2009, the proposal for a Council Decision lapsed and was formally withdrawn. Therefore, these two texts need to be merged into this single amended proposal for a Regulation, which takes into account the changes resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and which contains the substantive provisions initially proposed as a Council Decision. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five possible options to achieve the objective of long-term operational management of SIS II, VIS and EURODAC were analysed: Option 1 - baseline : the operational management solution for SIS II and VIS identified for the transitional period (the Commission entrusting the operational management tasks to Member States' authorities) would be continued as a permanent solution. Currently, EURODAC is managed by the Commission and this solution would also be maintained; Option 2 - baseline+ : under which the Commission would entrust the operational management tasks related to SIS II, VIS and EURODAC to Member States' authorities; Option 3 - a new Regulatory Agency that would assume responsibility for the long-term operational management of SIS II, VIS and EURODAC; Option 4 - FRONTEX would manage the three systems, which would entail changes to both its basic act and its management structure; Option 5 - EUROPOL would manage SIS II, whereas the Commission would manage VIS and EURODAC. This option was considered while negotiations on the conversion of the current Europol Convention into a Community act were still ongoing. As a result of a comparative analysis, the new Regulatory Agency option, which aims to create a joint operational management structure (option 3) for SIS II, VIS and EURODAC scored highest. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 77(2)(a) and (b), 78(2)(e), 79(2)(c), 74, 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The proposal respects the principle of subsidiarity, as the objective of the proposed action, the conferring of the operational management of Central SIS II, Central VIS and the National Interfaces, Central EURODAC, as well as certain aspects of their communication infrastructure, on an Agency, cannot be achieved by the Member States individually. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a European Agency for the operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), EURODAC and for developing and managing other large-scale IT systems, in application of Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The regulatory Agency shall be established as a Union body, having legal personality. The first tasks to be conferred on the Agency are operational, that is to say, ensuring the overall management of the information systems and the operation of the systems. It would thus become a ""centre of excellence"" with specialised operational staff. The Agency's core task will be to fulfil the operational management tasks for SIS II, VIS and EURODAC, keeping the systems functioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week, thus ensuring a continuous, uninterrupted flow of data exchange. Beyond these operational tasks, the corresponding responsibilities for adopting security measures, reporting, publishing, monitoring, information, organising specific VIS and SIS II related trainings, implementing pilot schemes upon specific and precise request of the Commission and monitoring of research will be assigned to the Agency. The Agency could also potentially be responsible for developing and managing other large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. This would be subject to legislative instruments establishing such systems that in turn would provide the Agency with the respective competences. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Agency will be funded by the general budget of the European Union. The necessary appropriations to cover the activities of the Agency will come from the appropriations currently foreseen in the Financial Programming 2011-2013 in the budget lines: 18 02 04""Schengen Information System (SIS II)""; 18 02 05""Visa Information System (VIS)""; 18 03 11""EURODAC"". Therefore, the proposal does not impact on the financial framework for 2007-2013. The financial statement annexed to this proposal is based on the assumption that it will be adopted in 2010 in order for the Agency to be legally established in 2011 and become a fully fledged Agency in 2012. Overall, the preparatory and start-up phase of the Agency between 2010 and 2013 is estimated at EUR 113 million, which will be covered by the 2007‑2013 financial framework."
5528EP7,"""""Public procurement""""",0.754,0.853,0.895,0.355,0.273,0.952,0.908,0.486,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to modernise existing public procurement legislation in order to make it better suited to deal with the evolving political, social and economic context. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: p ublic procurement plays an important role in the overall economic performance of the European Union. In Europe, public authorities spend around 18 % of GDP on supplies, works and services. Given the volume of purchases, public procurement can be used as a powerful lever for achieving a Single Market fostering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. A comprehensive economic evaluation has shown that the public procurement Directives have achieved their objectives to a considerable extent. They have resulted in greater transparency and higher levels of competition while achieving measurable savings through lower prices. The Commission published on 27 January 2011 a Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy — Towards a more efficient European Procurement Market launching a broad public consultation on options for legislative changes to make the award of contracts easier and more flexible and enable public contracts to be put to better use in support of other policies. A very large majority of stakeholders appreciated the initiative of the Commission to review the current public procurement policy. They voiced demand for a review of the public procurement directives to simplify the rules, increase their efficiency and effectiveness and make them better suited to deal with the evolving political, social and economic context. This proposal has two complementary objectives: Increase the efficiency of public spending to ensure the best possible procurement outcomes in terms of value for money. This implies in particular a simplification and flexibilisation of the existing public procurement rules. Streamlined, more efficient procedures will benefit all economic operators and facilitate the participation of SMEs and cross-border bidders. Allow procurers to make better use of public procurement in support of common societal goals such as protection of the environment, higher resource and energy efficiency, combating climate change, promoting innovation, employment and social inclusion and ensuring the best possible conditions for the provision of high quality social services. This initiative implements the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiatives on a Digital Agenda for Europe, the Innovation Union, an Integrated Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, Energy 2020 and a Resource Efficient Europe. It also implements the Single Market Act, in particular its twelfth key action ‘Revised and Modernised Public Procurement Legislative Framework’. Together with the proposed new utilities Directive, the proposal will replace Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC as the core elements of the European Union public procurement legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment and its executive summary give an overview of the different options for each of the five groups of basic problems (administrative organisation, scope, procedures, strategic procurement and access to procurement markets). Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the different options, a package of preferred options was identified that should optimise the synergies between the different solutions allowing savings due to one type of action to neutralise related costs caused by another (e.g. possible increased procedural requirements caused by strategic procurement actions could partially be neutralised by savings related to the improved design of procurement procedures). These preferred options form the basis of the present proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1), Article 62 and Article 114 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the main axes of the proposal are as follows: (1) Simplification and flexibilisation of procurement procedures Clarification of scope: the basic concept of ‘procurement’ has been newly introduced in order to better determine the scope and purpose of procurement law and to facilitate the application of the thresholds. The definitions of certain key notions determining the scope of the Directive (such as body governed by public law, public works and service contracts, mixed contracts) have been revised in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice; the traditional distinction between so-called prioritary and non-prioritary services (‘A’ and ‘B’ services) will be abolished . However, it became also clear that the regular procurement regime is not adapted to social services which need a specific set of rules. Toolbox approach: Member State systems will provide two basic forms of procedure, open and restricted procedure. They may, in addition, foresee, subject to certain conditions, the competitive procedure with negotiation, the competitive dialogue and/or the innovation partnership, a new form of procedure for innovative procurement; contracting authorities will furthermore have at their disposal a set of six specific procurement techniques and tools intended for aggregated and electronic procurement: framework agreements, dynamic purchasing systems, electronic auctions, electronic catalogues, central purchasing bodies and joint procurement. Compared to the existing Directive, these tools have been improved and clarified with a view to facilitating e‑procurement. Lighter regime for sub-central contracting authorities: in line with the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, the proposal provides a simplified procurement regime that applies to all contracting authorities below the central government level, such as local and regional authorities. These purchasers may use a prior information notice as a means of calling for competition. If they make use of this faculty, they don’t have to publish a separate contract notice before launching the procurement procedure. Promotion of e-procurement: the proposal aims at helping Member States to achieve the switchover to e-procurement enabling suppliers to take part in online procurement procedures across the Internal Market. It provides for the mandatory transmission of notices in electronic form, the mandatory electronic availability of the procurement documents and imposes the switch to fully electronic communication, in particular e-submission, in all procurement procedures within a transition period of two years. Modernisation of procedures: time-limits for participations and submission of offers have been shortened . The distinction between selection of tenderers and award of the contract which is often a source of errors and misunderstandings has been made more flexible, allowing it for contracting authorities to decide on the most practical sequencing by examining award criteria before selection criteria and to take into account the organisation and quality of the staff assigned to performing the contract as an award criterion; the grounds for exclusion of candidates and tenderers have been reviewed and clarified . Contracting authorities will be entitled to exclude economic operators which have shown significant or persistent deficiencies in performing prior contracts. The proposal provides also for the possibility of ‘self-cleaning’: contracting authorities may accept candidates or tenderers in spite of the existence of an exclusion ground if they have taken appropriate measures to remedy the consequences of any illicit behaviour and effectively prevent further occurrences of the misbehaviour; the modification of contracts during their term has become an increasingly relevant and problematic issue for practitioners. A specific provision on modification of contracts takes up the basic solutions developed by case-law and provides a pragmatic solution for dealing with unforeseen circumstances requiring an adaption of a public contract during its term. (2) Strategic use of public procurement in response to new challenges: the proposed Directive is based on enabling approach providing contracting authorities with the instruments needed to contribute to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategic goals by using their purchasing power to procure goods and services that foster innovation, respect the environment and combat climate change while improving employment, public health and social conditions. Life-cycle costing : the proposal gives public purchasers the possibility to base their award decisions on life-cycle costs of the products, services or works to be purchased. Production process : contracting authorities may refer to all factors directly linked to the production process in the technical specifications and in the award criteria, as long as they refer to aspects of the production process which are closely related to the specific production or provision of the good or service purchased. This excludes requirements not related to the process of producing the products, works or services covered by the procurement, such as general corporate social responsibility requirements covering the whole operation of the contractor. Labels : contracting authorities may require that works, supplies or services bear specific labels certifying environmental, social or other characteristics, provided that they accept also equivalent labels. Sanctioning violations of mandatory social, labour or environmental law : under the proposed Directive, a contracting authority can exclude economic operators from the procedure, if it identifies infringements of obligations established by Union legislation in the field of social, labour or environmental law or of international labour law provisions. Social services : The evaluation on the impact and effectiveness of EU public procurement legislation has shown that social, health and education services have specific characteristics which make them inappropriate for the application of the regular procedures for the award of public service contracts. These services are typically provided within a specific context that varies widely between Member States due to different administrative, organisational and cultural circumstances. The services have, by their very nature, only a very limited cross-border dimension. Member States should therefore have large discretion to organise the choice of service providers. The proposal takes account of this by providing a specific regime for public contracts for these services, with a higher threshold of EUR 500 000 and imposing only the respect of basic principles of transparency and equal treatment. Innovation : the proposal provides for this purpose the innovation partnership, a new special procedure for the development and subsequent purchase of new, innovative products, works and services, provided they can be delivered to agreed performance levels and costs. (3) Better access to the market for SMEs and Start-ups Simplification of information obligations : the proposal provides for the mandatory acceptance of self-declarations as prima-facie evidence for selection purposes. The actual production of documentary evidence will be facilitated by a standardised document, the European Procurement Passport which is a means of proof for the absence of grounds for exclusion. Division into lots : contracting authorities will be invited to divide public contracts into — homogeneous or heterogeneous — lots to make them more accessible for SMEs. Limitation on requirements for participation : to avoid unjustified barriers in the way of participation by SMEs, the proposed Directive contains an exhaustive list of possible conditions for participation in procurement procedures. Turnover requirements which are frequently a formidable obstacle to access by SMEs are explicitly limited to three times the estimated contract value, except in duly justified cases. Finally, any conditions for participation by groups of economic operators — an instrument of particular relevance for SMEs — must be justified by objective reasons and proportionate. Direct payment of subcontractors : Member State can provide that subcontractors may request for direct payment by the contracting authority of supplies, works and services provided to the main contractor in the context of the contract performance. (4) Sound procedures Conflicts of interest : the proposal contains a specific provision on conflicts of interest covering actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest situations affecting staff members of the contracting authority or of procurement service providers intervening in the procedure and members of the contracting authority’s management who may influence the outcome of a procurement procedure even if they are not formally involved in it. Illicit conduct : the proposal contains a specific provision against illicit behaviour by candidates and tenderers, such as attempts to improperly influence the decision-making process or entering into agreements with other participants to manipulate the outcome of the procedure have to be excluded from the procedure. Unfair advantages : the proposal contains a specific provision on safeguards against undue preference in favour of participants who have advised the contracting authority or been involved in the preparation of the procedure. (5) Governance National oversight bodies : the proposal provides that Member States designate a single national authority in charge of monitoring, implementation and control of public procurement. Knowledge centres : the proposal obliges Member States to provide support structures offering legal and economic advice, guidance, training and assistance in preparing and conducting procurement procedures. To reinforce the fight against corruption and favouritism, contracting authorities will be obliged to transmit the text of concluded contracts to the oversight body. However, the creation of disproportionate administrative burden must be avoided; the obligation to transmit the full text of concluded contracts should therefore remain limited to relatively high value contracts. The thresholds proposed would strike the right balance between increasing administrative burden and ensuring greater transparency: with a threshold of EUR 1 000 000 for supplies and services, and of EUR 10 000 000, this obligation would apply to 10 - 20 % of all procurement published in the Official Journal. Administrative cooperation : the proposal provides also for effective cooperation allowing national oversight bodies to share information and best practices and to cooperate through the Internal Market Information System (IMI). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services revealed that operators in national markets are facing obstacles to the development of inter-urban coach services. An ex-post evaluation of the Regulation was carried out from 2015 to 2017 and concluded that the Regulation is only partly effective in achieving its original objective of promoting coach and bus services as a sustainable alternative to individual car transport. By pursuing the opening of national markets, the proposal is part of the second mobility package, which aims to combat climate change, make European industry more competitive and improve the quality of life and choice of citizens for their daily mobility. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the combination of measures selected would make it possible to: generate administrative savings for businesses and administrations in the range of EUR 1.560 million for the EU-28 over the assessment period (2015-2035); increase the activity of coach transport by more than 11 % in 2030 relative to the baseline and increase its modal share by almost one percentage point; improve the connectivity of disadvantaged social groups by 62 billion passenger-kilometres in 2030 while creating 85 000 new jobs and contribute to lower accident costs of EUR 2.8 billion for the EU-28 over the assessment period; have a positive impact on the environment with a EUR 183 million net cumulative savings in CO2 emissions costs and net cumulative savings in air pollution costs of EUR 590 million for the EU-28; This would not undermine the sustainability of public service contracts serving remote urban areas. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the Regulation on passenger coach services with a view to granting access to national markets for regular services. It provides in particular for the following: Scope : the proposal extends the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 to all inter-urban carriage of passengers by regular services. Non-resident carriers should be able to operate national regular services under the same conditions as resident carriers. Regulatory body : each Member State is required to designate an independent and impartial regulatory body. The objective of that requirement is to avoid any conflicts of interest when a regulatory body is conducting an economic analysis to determine if economic equilibrium of a public service contract is compromised. The body should be able to obtain the information requested and enforce its decisions by means of appropriate penalties. Right of access to terminals : carriers should enjoy a right of access to terminals on fair, equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent terms for the purpose of operating regular services. Applications for access should only be refused if there is a lack of capacity in the terminal. Decisions on applications for access are to be taken within two months and shall contain a proper statement of reasons. Carriers shall have the possibility to appeal decisions to the Regulatory body. Regular services subject to authorisation : the proposal establishes: an authorising procedure for the international carriage of passengers over a distance of less than 100 kilometres as the crow flies : authorisations shall be granted unless rejection is justified under the clearly specified; an authorising procedure for the international carriage of passengers over a distance 100 kilometres or more as the crow flies : the refusal of a new service cannot be justified on the grounds that it compromises the economic equilibrium of a public service contract; an authorisation procedure for national regular services : the authorisation for a new service carrying passengers over distance of less than 100 kilometres as the crow flies can be rejected if it compromises the economic equilibrium of a public service contract. In addition, the proposal: abolishes the use of the journey form as a control document for occasional services. This should eliminate an unnecessary administrative burden; deletes the obligation according to which regular services are to be performed as part of a regular international service as well as the prohibition of cabotage operations in the form of regular services being carried out independent of a regular service; puts an end to the obligation to establish cabotage journey forms for occasional services; amends rules relating to inspections on the road and in undertakings to include cabotage operations. Lastly, reporting requirements are foreseen so that the Commission can have consistent information from all Member States to enable it to monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the legislation."
10166EP8,"""""OLAF investigations and cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office""""",0.186,0.792,0.94,0.312,0.154,0.851,0.77,0.038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to propose new rules to facilitate cooperation between the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Public Prosecutor's Office. BACKGROUND: with the adoption of Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the Union has substantially strengthened the means available to protect the financial interests of the Union by means of criminal law. The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) will have the power to carry out criminal investigations and bring indictments related to criminal offences affecting the Union budget, as defined in Directive (EU) 2017/1371, in the participating Member States. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) conducts administrative investigations into administrative irregularities as well as into criminal behaviour. At the end of its investigations, it may make judicial recommendations to the national prosecution authorities, aimed at enabling indictments and prosecutions in the Member States. In future, in the Member States participating in the EPPO, it will report suspected criminal offences to the EPPO, and will collaborate with it in the context of its investigations. In view of their common goal to preserve the integrity of the Union budget, OLAF and the EPPO should establish and maintain a close relationship based on sincere cooperation and aimed at ensuring the complementarity of their respective mandates and coordination of their action, in particular as regards the scope of the enhanced cooperation for the establishment on the EPPO. The European Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) 883/2013 concerning investigations conducted by OLAF in order to ensure the highest level of protection of the Union's financial interests through synergies between the two bodies. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Regulation No 883/2013 is a consequence of the adoption of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and aims to ensure consistency in the legal framework for the protection of the Union's financial interests. It has three specific objectives: (i) adapt the operation of OLAF to the establishment of the EPPO; (i) enhance the effectiveness of OLAF’s investigative function; (iii) clarify and simplify selected provisions of Regulation No 883/2013. As the revised Regulation should be in force by the time the EPPO becomes operational, the proposal therefore contains a limited number of essential changes necessary in the short term to strengthen the framework for OLAF investigations, in order to maintain a strong and fully functioning OLAF that complements the EPPO's criminal law approach with administrative investigations, but which do not entail a change to its mandate or powers. To this end, the proposal introduces the necessary provisions into OLAF's legal framework as regards: OLAF's obligation to report without undue delay to the EPPO any conduct over which the latter may exercise its competence; the information provided to the European Public Prosecutor's Office shall be sufficiently substantiated and contain the necessary information; non-duplication of investigations : OLAF shall not open a parallel investigation into facts identical to those under investigation by the European Public Prosecutor's Office; the specific procedural rules applicable to requests from the European Public Prosecutor's Office to OLAF to support or complement the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The amendment also provides for a number of limited clarifications aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of OLAF's administrative investigations, based on the Commission's recent evaluation. The focus is on those areas where, at present, the lack of clarity in certain provisions of the existing Regulation hinders the effectiveness of OLAF's interventions. The proposal: includes rules improving the performance of on-the-spot checks and inspections: the proposed amendments maintain the current powers and would provide a clearer framework for the application of national law, thus specifying more clearly the applicable safeguards and the rights of the operators concerned. The conduct by OLAF of on-the-spot checks and inspections, where economic operators submit to a check by OLAF, is subject to Union law alone. During on-the-spot checks, the economic operator concerned would have the right not to incriminate himself and to be assisted by a person of his choice; provides OLAF with access to bank account information and provides OLAF with the necessary tools to carry out its VAT checks. The proposal specifies the obligation of Member States to assist OLAF by transmitting information relating to bank accounts. It also allows OLAF to exchange information with the Eurofisc network; introduces a principle of admissibility of OLAF reports - subject only to a verification of authenticity – in judicial proceedings of a non-criminal nature before national courts and in administrative proceedings in the Member States. It specifies the role of the anti-fraud coordination services in the Member States in order to ensure that OLAF is provided with the assistance it needs for its investigations to be effective."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/936 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Union import rules. The release of the political prisoners on 22 August 2015 was an important step, which together with several positive initiatives undertaken by Belarus over the last two years contributed to the improvement of EU-Belarus relations. The Commission considers that it is necessary to recognise the positive political developments between the European Union and Belarus and to further improve bilateral relations. CONTENT: recognising the positive political developments in relations between the European Union and Belarus and in order to further improve bilateral relations, the Commission proposes to abolish the autonomous quotas on imports of textiles and clothing originating in Belarus, also considering their limited use. To that effect, Annexes II and III of Regulation (EU) 2015/936 should be amended accordingly. In addition, this opportunity will be seized to correct erroneous CN codes and to introduce the official names of the Republic of Belarus and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea according to the 2011 Interinstitutional Style Guide of the European Union, as well as to increase the period of validity of import authorisations from six to nine months in order to facilitate administrative procedures."
1566EP7,"""""Amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova""""",0.772,0.806,0.737,0.419,0.303,0.699,0.8,0.571,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Moldova is experiencing difficulties with its wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the Moldovan government. This has led Moldova to request the European Commission in July 2010 to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine under the Autonomous Trade Preferences, granted to Moldova by Council Regulation (EC) 55/2008. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the wine sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 300 000 people (one fourth of the working population), who are mainly living in rural areas and cultivating medium to smaller family plots. It is therefore proposed to provide a measure to improve the general level of wine imports from Moldova to support the economic development of this country. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide a positive outlook to the people working in the wine industry in Moldova, it is proposed to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine: for 2011 from 100 000 hectolitres (hl) to 150 000 hl, for 2012 from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl, from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year. The level of the proposed increase is based on the fact that Moldova has systematically exhausted the existing quota and the potential of the sector to improve its niche markets in the EU, while at the same time the level of the increase does not destabilise the EU wine industry. It is expected that Moldova's wine sector will continue to improve the quality of its wines. As Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 expires on 31 December 2012, and as it is important to ensure legal certainty for producers, exporters and importers, it is proposed to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 for another three years to 31 December 2015. This is a reasonable amount of time, taking into account the perspectives for a future deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA) between the EU and Moldova. Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 foresees preferential tariff quotas also on other products in addition to wine. Having assessed the situation in the different sectors covered by the quotas, it is proposed to continue the progressive increase of some of those other quotas for the levels indicated in the annexed to this proposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed Regulation does not incur costs charged to the EU budget. As the general level of imports from Moldova is merely 0.04% of all EU imports further market opening is not expected to create negative effects for the EU. Currently around 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU free of duties. The additional duty free tariff quotas proposed for the years 2011 to 2015 will result in a small loss of tariff revenue only for the year 2011. For the years 2012 to 2015 there will not be any loss of tariff revenue since present export volumes from Moldova of all the products covered by duty free tariff quotas are covered by the 2012 level of these quotas. Hypothetical revenue that could have been generated by future exports is not considered as a loss of tariff revenue."
3047EP8,"""""Use of Passenger Name Record data (EU PNR)""""",0.914,0.864,0.0,0.062,0.115,0.731,0.785,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to provide a legal framework on the on the use of Passenger Name Record data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Commission adopted, on Tuesday 6 November, a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. This proposal has been subject to in-depth discussions with the Working Groups in the Council and the “Justice and Home Affairs” Council reviewed, in January, July and November 2008, the work carried out on this issue. The discussions enable a consensus to be reached on many of the provisions. Following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the 1 December 2009, the 2007 draft framework proposal, which had not yet been adopted by the Council, became obsolete. This new proposal replaces it and is based on the provisions of the TFEU. It takes into account the views expressed by Member States in Council discussions on the draft Framework decision, as well as the recommendations of the European Parliament as stated in its Resolution of 20 November 2008 and the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Over the last decade the EU and other parts of the world have seen an increase in serious and organised crime, such as trafficking in human beings and drugs. This proposal responds to a request for increased cooperation on organised crime and terrorism. As a response to the threat posed by serious crime and terrorism, and the abolition of internal border controls under the Schengen Convention, the EU adopted measures such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), and the anticipated Entry/Exit System are examples of such measures. The ‘Stockholm Programme’ also calls on the Commission to present a proposal for the use of PNR data to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorism and serious crime. PNR data is unverified information provided by passengers, and collected by and held in the carriers’ reservation and departure control systems for their own commercial purposes. It contains several different types of information, such as travel dates, travel itinerary, ticket information, contact details, the travel agent at which the flight was booked, means of payment used, seat number and baggage information. More systematic collection, use and retention of PNR data with respect to international flights, subject to strict data protection guarantees, would strengthen the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and is necessary to meet those threats to security and reduce the harm they cause. Given that the use of PNR data is not currently regulated at EU level, it is necessary to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal does not require air carriers to collect any additional information from passengers or to retain any data, nor does it require passengers to provide any data in addition to that already being provided to air carriers. In order to ensure compliance with the principle of proportionality, the proposal is therefore carefully limited in scope and contains strict data protection guarantees. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four main options were examined in the Impact Assessment, each containing two variables: Option A : refraining from addressing the issue at EU level and maintaining the status quo. Option B : addressing the structure of a system for collecting and processing PNR data: with option B.1: Decentralised collection and processing of data by Member States; with option B.2: Centralised collection and processing of data at EU level. Option C : addressing limitation of the purpose of the proposed measures: with option C.1: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime only; with option C.2: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and other policy objectives. Option D : addressing the modes of transport to be covered by the proposed measures: with option D.1: Air carriers only; with option D.2: Air, sea and rail carriers. The options were assessed against the following criteria: security in the EU, protection of personal data, costs to public authorities, costs for carriers/competition in the internal market and encouraging a global approach. The Impact Assessment concluded that a legislative proposal applicable to travel by air with decentralised collection of PNR data for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and other serious crime was the best policy option (combination of B1, C1 and D1). This would enhance security in the EU, while limiting the impact on the protection of personal data to the minimum and keeping costs at an acceptable level. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Directive contains several chapters which may be summarised as follows: Chapter I - General provisions : t he proposal aims to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Passenger Name Record data as set out in the annex of the proposal include, inter alia: PNR record locator; date of reservation/issue of ticket; date(s) of intended travel; name(s); addresses; billing information; seat numbers; etc. Other general remarks are also made including all available information on unaccompanied minors under 18 years, such as name and gender of the minor, age, name and contact details of guardian on departure and relationship to the minor, name and contact details of guardian on arrival and relationship to the minor, departure and arrival agent). Chapter II - Responsibilities : On Member States :e ach Member State shall set up or designate an authority competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime or a branch of such an authority to act as its ‘Passenger Information Unit’ responsible for collecting PNR data from the air carriers, storing them, analysing them and transmitting the result of the analysis to the competent authorities. The PNR data transferred by the air carriers in relation to international flights which land on or depart from the territory of each Member State shall be collected by the Passenger Information Unit of the relevant Member State. Should the PNR data transferred by air carriers include data beyond those listed in the Annex, the Passenger Information Unit shall delete such data immediately upon receipt. Member States shall ensure that the assessment criteria are set by the Passenger Information Units, in cooperation with the competent authorities. The assessment criteria shall in no circumstances be based on a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. The Passenger Information Unit of a Member State shall transfer the PNR data or the results of the processing of PNR data of the persons identified for the purpose of further examination to the relevant competent authorities of the same Member State. Such transfers shall only be made on a case-by- case basis. Obligations on air carriers :M ember States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that air carriers transfer ('push') the PNR data to the extent that such data are already collected by them, to the database of the national Passenger Information Unit of the Member State on the territory of which the international flight will land or from the territory of which the flight will depart. Air carriers shall transfer PNR data by electronic means using the common protocols and supported data formats to be adopted, or in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means ensuring an appropriate level of data security: (a) 24 to 48 hours before the scheduled time for flight departure; and (b) immediately after flight closure, that is once the passengers have boarded the aircraft in preparation for departure and it is no longer possible for further passengers to board. Member States may permit air carriers to limit the transfer to updates of the transfers. On a case-by-case basis, upon request from a Passenger Information Unit in accordance with national law, air carriers shall transfer PNR data where access earlier than that mentioned is necessary to assist in responding to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or serious crime. Transfer of data to third countries : it is explicitly stated that a Member State may transfer PNR data to a third country under strict and limited conditions and with express authorisation from the Member States for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. Period of data retention : Member States shall ensure that the PNR data provided by the air carriers to the Passenger Information Unit are retained in a database at the Passenger Information Unit for a period of 30 days after their transfer to the Passenger Information Unit of the first Member State on whose territory the international flight is landing or departing. Upon expiry of the period of 30 days after the transfer of the PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the data shall be retained at the Passenger Information Unit for a further period of five years. During this period, all data elements which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR data relate shall be masked out. Access to the full PNR data shall be permitted only by the Head of the Passenger Information Unit for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of a terrorist offence or serious crime, and to provide the competent authorities with the results of such processing; and where it could be reasonably believed that it is necessary to carry out an investigation or prosecution. Penalties against air carriers : penalties are provided for against air carriers which, do not transmit the data required under this Directive, to the extent that they are already collected by the them, or do not do so in the required format or otherwise infringe the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Protection of personal data : the proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Each Member State shall provide that, in respect of all processing of personal data pursuant to this Directive, every passenger shall have the same right to access, the right to rectification, erasure and blocking, the right to compensation and the right to judicial redress as those adopted under national law in implementation of Articles 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. The draft Decision lays down a number of provisions which aim to: prohibit any processing of PNR data revealing a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life; ensure the traceability of all processing of PNR data by air carriers, all transfers of PNR data by Passenger Information Units and all requests by competent authorities or Passenger Information Units of other Member States and third countries; ensure that air carriers, their agents or other ticket sellers for the carriage of passengers on air service inform passengers of international flights at the time of booking a flight and at the time of purchase of a ticket in a clear and precise manner about the provision of PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the purposes of their processing, the period of data retention, their possible use to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime, the possibility of exchanging and sharing such data and their data protection rights, in particular the right to complain to a national data protection supervisory authority of their choice; lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to be imposed in case of infringements of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Chapter IV - Implementing measures : this chapter concerns common protocols and supported data formats. All transfers of PNR data by air carriers to the Passenger Information Units for the purposes of this Directive shall be made by electronic means or, in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means, for a period of one year following the adoption of the common protocols and supported data formats. The technical provisions of comitology are also provided to this effect. Chapter V - Final provisions : Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive at the latest two years after the entry into force of this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive. There will be a transitional period for the proposal in the form of a two year implementation period. There will also be a transitional collection of PNR data, aiming to achieve collection of data on all flights within 6 years from the entry into force of the Directive. The proposal includes a review clause providing for a review of the operation of the Directive four years after its transposition date and a special review of the potential extension of the scope of the Directive to cover PNR data of passengers on flights internal to the EU. Member States shall prepare a set of statistical information on PNR data provided to the Passenger Information Units. Territorial application : the application of the Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols Nos 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the breeding of domestic animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species, and to a lesser extent the breeding of animals of other species, occupy an important place in Union agriculture and is a source of income for the agricultural community. The breeding of animals of those species is best encouraged if purebred breeding animals or hybrid breeding pigs of recorded high genetic quality are used. Member States have thus consistently endeavoured, as part of their agricultural policy, to promote, sometimes through public investment, the production of livestock of particular genetic characteristic that meets defined performance standards. Disparities between those standards have the potential to create technical barriers to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports into the Union. At present Union zootechnical legislation consists of four species specific (vertical) basic acts laying down the fundamental principles, concerning breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species. Technical requirements of identical nature for acceptance of breeding animals for breeding are currently regulated in three Council Directives and a Commission Decision. A horizontal Directive, complemented by implementing measures, provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals and their germinal products. Lastly, a specific Council Decision provides rules on the designation of a reference centre for breeding of bovine animals. CONTENT: the proposed regulation provides in a single legal framework the principles relating to: the approval or recognition and listing of breeding organisations, breeders associations and private undertakings, the registration and classification of animals in herd-books, flock-books, studbooks and, in the case of hybrid breeding pigs in registers, performance testing and genetic evaluation, the content and format of zootechnical certificates for breeding animals and their semen, ova and embryos. In addition, the proposal provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals, their semen, ova and embryos, and the designation of reference centres for breeding of animals. Provisions are laid down in this Regulation to carry out official controls and zootechnical checks and to resolve disputes arising where zootechnical checks disclose non-compliance with zootechnical requirements. However, the rules hereby proposed mirror those laid down in the Commission proposal for a new Regulation on official controls that is currently discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council. The Commission will closely follow the evolution of the discussions on the two texts, and will make the necessary proposals in due time in order to ensure that the provisions on official controls in the field of zootechnics are included in the forthcoming Regulation on official controls. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE : Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: Money laundering and terrorism financing create thus a high risk to the integrity, proper functioning, reputation and stability of the financial system. The changing nature of money laundering and terrorist financing threats requires a permanent adaptation of the legal framework to counter such threats. At EU level, Directive 2005/60/EC (the Third Anti Money Laundering Directive or AMLD) sets out the framework designed to protect financial institutions against the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. The EU rules are to a large extent based on international standards adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). At international level, the FATF has undertaken a fundamental review of international standards and adopted a new set of Recommendations in February 2012. In parallel to the international process, the European Commission has been undertaking its own review of the European framework. The proposed revision of the Directive is complementary to the revised FATF Recommendations, which represent a substantial strengthening of the anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment, where it analysed the potential consequences of money laundering and terrorism financing. It also analysed the impact of the legislative proposals on fundamental rights. In order to rectify the problems identified, the assessment concluded that the following operational objectives must be achieved: ensure consistency between national rules and, where appropriate, flexibility in their implementation by strengthening and clarifying current requirements; ensure that the rules are risk-focused and adjusted to address new emerging threats, by strengthening and clarifying current requirements; ensure that the EU approach is consistent with the approach followed at international level by extending the scope of application, and strengthening and clarifying the current requirements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal incorporates and repeals Commission Directive 2006/70/EC laying down implementing measures for Directive 2005/60/EC1, thus improving the comprehensibility and accessibility of the anti-money laundering legislative framework. The Commission proposes to make the following amendments to the Third Anti-Money Laundering Directive: broaden the scope of the Directive beyond casinos to cover the gambling services involving wagering a stake with monetary value in games of chance; include an explicit reference to tax crimes as a predicate offence; reduce the scope of the Directive and customer due diligence thresholds for traders in high value goods from EUR 15 000 to EUR 7 500 for cash transactions; introduce a requirement for Member States to carry out a risk assessment at national level and take measures to mitigate risks; Member States are required to ensure that enhanced due diligence must be conducted in certain situations of high risk, while allowing them to permit simplified due diligence in lower risk situations; require all companies to hold information on their beneficial owners; maintain the approach which requires identification of the beneficial owner from a 25% ownership threshold, but clarify what the ""25% threshold"" refers to; introduce new rules clarifying that branches and subsidiaries situated in Member States other than the head office must apply host state anti-money laundering rules and reinforce cooperation arrangements between home and host supervisors; remove the provisions relating to positive ""equivalence "" with third countries, as the use of exemptions on the grounds of purely geographical factors is less relevant; provide a range of sanctions that Member States should ensure are available for systematic breaches of key requirements of the Directive; bring in the provisions of Council Decision 2000/642/JHA concerning arrangements for cooperation between financial intelligence units of Member States in respect of exchanging information and also extend and strengthen cooperation; entrust certain tasks to the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA): (i) carry out an assessment and provide an opinion on money laundering and terrorist financing risks; (ii) produce guidance for financial institutions on what factors should be taken into account when applying simplified customer due diligence and enhanced customer due diligence and when applying a risk-based approach to supervision; introduce provisions to clarify the interaction between anti-money laundering/combating terrorist financing and data protection requirements; introduce new requirements for the treatment of domestic politically exposed persons (PEPs) and PEPs working in international organisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."
3625EP7,"""""Common fisheries policy""""",0.842,0.429,1.0,0.452,0.485,0.928,0.81,0.429,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: reforme of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Green Paper on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy concluded that despite progress since the 2002 reform, the objectives to achieve sustainable fisheries in all its dimensions (environmental, economic and social) have not been met. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers supported this conclusion. The main problems of the CFP are: lack of focus in the objectives on environmental, economic and social sustainability; unacceptably high levels of discards; fleet overcapacity, overfishing, total allowable catches (TACs) that are set too high, and low compliance have resulted in a large majority of Union stocks being overexploited; low profitability and low economic resilience for a significant number of fleets; insufficient integration of environmental concerns into the policy; lack of reliable data to assess all stocks and fleets; substantial public financial support to fisheries that does not contribute to achieving the objectives of the CFP; low attractiveness of the fishing activities and decline of some coastal communities dependent on fishing; top-down micro-management at Union level, lacking flexibility and adaptation to local and regional conditions; insufficient development of aquaculture in the Union; legislation and management are costly and extremely complex, which fosters lack of compliance; trade policy facing the challenge of globalisation and increased interdependence. The Common Fisheries Policy needs a fundamental reform by repealing the current Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy, and replacing it on 1 January 2013 by a new CFP adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: for the Impact Assessment exercise different options for the CFP reform package were identified. Two preferred options are similar in focusing on the environmental sustainability while creating sufficient flexibility to give the fishing sector time to adapt to ambitious environmental objectives. The impact assessment demonstrates that ambitious targets for the resources meeting the Union's international obligation of achieving maximum sustainable yield by 2015 can deliver important overall stock improvement leading to significant economic and social improvements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The Commission introduces in the proposal significant changes to the CFP. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: General Provisions : the overall objective of the CFP is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities provide long-term sustainable environmental conditions, which are a prerequisite to reach an economically and socially sustainable fishing industry that contributes to the availability of food. The policy shall be aimed at exploitation of living marine biological resources that restores and maintains fish resources at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, not later than 2015. The CFP shall implement the precautionary and ecosystem approaches to fisheries management. Access to waters :the proposal confirms the principle of equal access to waters, while treating third-country vessels with access to Union waters equally. The Commission proposes to extend the current restrictions on the right to fish within the 12- nautical miles until 2022. These restrictions have reduced fishing pressure in the most biologically sensitive areas and have contributed to economic stability for small-scale, coastal fishing activities. The Commission proposes to introduce into this regulation the specific restrictions for the 100 nautical miles around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Conservation of marine biological resources : conservation of marine biological resources is the fundamental pillar to achieve the objectives of the CFP. The proposal covers the main principles for technical conservation measures applicable to fisheries. For the multi-annual plans and the technical conservation measures the Commission envisages a move away from micro-management by the co-legislators. The Union legislation on these plans and measures needs to define the essentials, such as the scope, targets, evaluation indicators and time frames. The Commission proposes decentralization that may authorize Member States to adopt the conservation and technical measures necessary to achieve the objectives and targets using a toolbox of measures under the conservation policy. This will create regional flexibility and simplification of the policy. Access to resources : the proposal introduces a mandatory system of transferable fishing concessions (on fishing opportunities for regulated stocks) as from 2014 for all vessels with the exception of vessels under 12 meters with passive gear. Management of fishing capacity : the general obligation for Member States to adjust the fleet capacity to the fishing opportunities is maintained. For the period when decommissioning of vessels with public aid remains possible under the European Fisheries Fund, the provisions on fleet capacity reductions have to remain in place. The Member State and Commission fleet registers will ensure informed monitoring and management of the fleets. Science base for fisheries management : the proposal introduces provisions for Member States to adopt national fisheries data collection and scientific and innovation programs and to coordinate between themselves, in particular with a view to the Union research and innovation framework. External policy : the external policy is integrated into the CFP to ensure alignment of its objectives with the overall principles and objectives of the CFP. The Union shall actively participate in the works of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), as well as international multilateral bodies (UN, FAO) in order to strengthen them and enhance their performance in the management and conservation of international fish stocks. Relations with third countries through Sustainable Fisheries Agreements (SFAs) are another means to promote internationally the CFP principles and objectives. Aquaculture : the CFP should support the environmentally, economically and socially sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. The Commission considers that the specific nature of aquaculture requires a focalized stakeholder consultation body, and proposes to this effect the creation of an Advisory Council for Aquaculture. Common Market Organisation : the organisation of the common markets needs to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, to enable the industry to apply the CFP at the appropriate level, and to strengthen competitiveness, particularly of producers. Control and Enforcement : c onsistent with the new control regime as adopted with Council Regulations No 1005/2008 and No 1224/2009, the proposal integrates the basic elements for the Union control and enforcement regime for compliance with the rules of the CFP. The Commission proposes monitoring and control obligations in particular in relation to fully documented fishery, as well as pilot projects on new fisheries control technologies that contribute to sustainable fishing. Financial Instruments : to increase compliance the proposal introduces conditions for Union financial assistance that may be granted to contribute to the achievement of the CFP objectives. Financial assistance will become conditional upon compliance with the rules, and this principle will apply to both Member States and operators. For Member States non-compliance may result in interruption, suspension or financial correction to the Union financial assistance. For operators serious, infringements may lead to banning of access to financial assistance or financial reductions. Advisory Councils : the Commission proposes to consolidate and where possible to extend the experience with the Regional Advisory Councils under the CFP. The proposal should provide for regionalisation of measures on a sea-basin approach under the conservation pillar. In conjunction with this proposal the Commission will adopt a proposal for a Regulation on the common organisation of the markets in fisheries and aquaculture products. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the impact is estimated at € 69.754 million for operational expenditure in commitment appropriations for the year 2013. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
9485EP8,"""""Internal Security Fund""""",0.671,0.842,0.02,0.333,0.077,0.955,0.843,0.038,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. Regulation BACKGROUND: over recent years, security threats have intensified and diversified in Europe. Terrorism, serious and organised crime, itinerant crime, drug trafficking, corruption, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings and arms, among others, continue to challenge the internal security of the Union. The challenges the Union is facing, notably from international terrorism, cannot be managed by individual Member States alone and without the financial and technical support of the EU. Security has an inherently cross-border dimension and therefore a strong, coordinated Union response is required. Financial support provided under this Regulation shall contribute in particular to strengthening national and Union capabilities in the security area. The Commission proposes to multiply EU funding for internal security by factor of 1.8 compared to the current period (2014-2020), so as to ensure a high level of security within the Union while strengthening the role of decentralised agencies in this area. The new internal security fund builds on the investments and achievements of its predecessor instruments: (i) the security and safeguarding liberties programme; (ii) the instrument for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management (ISF-P) and (iii) the drugs component of the Justice programme. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The proposed scope builds largely on the current Regulation for the Internal Security Fund-Police, while taking into account new policy developments, such as the European security agenda, the fight against terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime, and the new interoperability agenda. Objectives : the new enhanced fund shall contribute to a high level of security in the Union, in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime. Its specific objectives shall be to: increase the exchange of information among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant Union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; intensify cross-border joint operations among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities in relation to serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; support effort at strengthening the capabilities in relation to combating and preventing crime including terrorism in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the Member States. Actions funded shall be implemented in full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity. Actions limited to maintaining public order at national level shall not be eligible. Member State support : the allocation of the funding to the programmes of the Member States shall be based on a distribution key of three criteria: (i) the gross domestic product; (ii) size of the territory and; (iii) population of the state. It is proposed to weigh the different criteria as follows: 45% to inverse proportion to the gross domestic product, 40% to proportion to the size of population and 15% to proportion to the size of the territory of the Member State. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for projects with real European added value or to meet urgent needs and emergency funding to Member States. Coordination between EU policies : the enhanced ISF shall be coherent with and complementary to other Union financial programmes, notably the cohesion policy funds and Horizon Europe, as well as the Integrated Border Management Fund and the Asylum and Migration Fund. Furthermore, work under the internal security fund shall be consistent with that of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The Commission proposes to allocate an amount of EUR 1.12 billion (in current prices) to EU agencies in the field of security. The proposed Regulation does not cover the funding for these agencies. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 2.5 billion (in current prices) to the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The financial envelope shall be used as follows: EUR 1.5 billion allocated to Member States to enable them to build long-term resilience in the field of security; EUR 1 billion allocated to the thematic mechanism to address unforeseen security challenges and to enable a rapid response to emergency situations."
3152EP7,"""""Permitted uses of orphan works""""",0.754,0.817,0.246,0.484,0.394,0.783,0.81,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to create a legal framework to ensure the lawful, cross-border online access to orphan works. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: l ibraries, museums, archives, educational establishments, film heritage institutions and public service broadcasting organisations are engaged in large-scale digitisation of their collections or archives in order to create European Digital Libraries. In so doing, they contribute to the preservation and dissemination of European cultural heritage, which is also important for the creation of European Digital Libraries, such as Europeana. Prior authorisations are necessary to make works protected by copyright available to the public in an online digital library or archive. When the relevant copyright owner cannot be identified or found the works in question are known as orphan works. Libraries or other institutions that make works available online to the public without prior authorisation risk infringing copyright. This initiative builds on the Commission's 2006 Recommendation on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural content and digital preservation. Despite the Recommendation, only a handful of Member States have implemented orphan works legislation. The few existing national solutions are circumscribed by the fact that they limit online access to citizens resident in their national territories. The creation of a legal framework to facilitate the cross-border digitisation and dissemination of orphan works in the single market is also one of the key actions identified in the Digital Agenda for Europe  which is part of the Europe 2020 Strategy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t he impact assessment analyses six options: Option 1 : do nothing, Option 2 : a statutory exception to copyright, Option 3 : extended collective licensing, Option 4 : an orphan-specific licence granted by collecting societies, Option 5 : an orphan-specific licence granted by a public body, and Option 6 : the mutual recognition of national solutions regarding orphan works. All policy options (except Option 1) are premised on the adoption of a directive that will require all Member States to enact specific orphan works legislation within a specified timeframe. All policy options, except Option 3, are premised on the requirement that a diligent search is necessary prior to the making available of an orphan work in an online digital library. The Commission considers that an approach based on mutual recognition of the orphan status (Option 6) allows libraries and other beneficiaries to enjoy legal certainty as to the ""orphan status"" of a particular work. Mutual recognition ensures that the orphan works contained in a digital library would be available to citizens across Europe. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to create a legal framework to ensure the lawful, crossborder online access to orphan works contained in online digital libraries or archives operated by a variety of institutions that are specified in the proposal when such orphan works are used in the pursuance of the public interest mission of such institutions. Such works include: works published in the form of books, journals, newspapers, magazines or other writings, and which are contained in the collections of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, or cinematographic or audiovisual works contained in the collections of film heritage institutions, or cinematographic, audio or audiovisual works produced by public service broadcasting organisations before the 31 December 2002 and contained in their archives. The proposal deals with the diligent search necessary to identify whether a particular work is an orphan work and, once this has been established, to make it legal to make this work available to the public online under certain conditions and for specific purposes. The proposal also clarifies the application of extended collective licences to works which are potentially orphan works. More specifically, the proposal: contains the definition of an orphan work. The definition of an orphan work incorporates the requirement of a diligent search; explains how the diligent search is to be carried out by those who are permitted to use orphan works. It also clarifies that a diligent search need only be carried out in the Member State of first publication of the work; establishes the principle of mutual recognition whereby a work deemed to be an orphan work after a diligent search shall be considered an orphan work in all Member States; concerns the possibility to put an end to the orphan work status; enumerates the uses that the named beneficiaries are permitted to undertake with respect to orphan works (to make them available to the public, within the meaning of Directive 2001/29/EC, and to reproduce such works, within the meaning of Directive 2001/29/EC, for the purposes of achieving their public interest mission); specifies how Member States may permit certain additional uses under specific conditions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."
2603EP8,"""""EU-Georgia Association Agreement: anti-circumvention mechanism""""",0.914,0.932,0.96,0.396,0.212,0.97,0.911,0.692,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to incorporate the anti-circumvention mechanism foreseen in the EU-Georgia Association Agreement into European Union law. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU-Georgia Association Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied from 1 September 2014. The Agreement includes a so-called anti-circumvention mechanism, which provides for the possibility to reintroduce the most favoured nation customs duty rate when imports of certain agricultural goods from Georgia exceed a given threshold without due justification of their exact origin. The Commission considered it necessary to lay down the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the anti-circumvention mechanism for the temporary suspension of tariff preferences contained in the Agreement. CONTENT: this proposed Regulation constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the anti-circumvention mechanism of the Agreement already concluded with Georgia. It provides for the possibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of six months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed agricultural products reach the defined annual import volumes. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. In order to prevent a negative impact on the Union market as a result of an increase in imports, the Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the temporary suspension of the preferential tariffs under the anti-circumvention mechanism provided in the Agreement, imperative grounds of urgency so require. For reasons of transparency, the Commission should submit an annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Agreement and the application of the anti-circumvention mechanism."
2514EP7,"""""Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) and protection of intellectual property rights""""",0.772,0.89,0.07,0.581,0.394,0.88,0.821,0.4,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to entrust the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) with certain tasks related to the protection of intellectual property rights, including the assembling of public and private sector representatives as a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy in order to avoid significant harm being caused by counterfeiting and piracy to the European economy and to the health and safety of European citizens. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU’s economic well-being relies on sustained creativity and innovation. Accordingly, the Europe 2020 Strategy  highlights the need to strengthen the EU’s research performance, to promote innovation throughout the Member States, ensuring that innovative ideas can be turned into new products and services that create growth and quality jobs. Intellectual property rights (IPR) are vital business assets, which help to ensure that innovators and creators get a fair return for their work and investments. Over the last ten years, however, IPR infringements have increased significantly. In 2009, the OECD estimated that international trade in counterfeit and pirated goods accounted for USD 250 billion in 2007, which is larger than the national GDPs of 150 economies. Also, figures published by EU customs authorities reflect a clear increase in customs activity, with a rise in registered cases from 26 704 in 2005 to 43 572 in 2009, i.e. up by about 60 % in five years. One of the main initiatives to address this threat launched by the Council and the Commission in 2009 was to set up a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy to improve understanding on intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements ('the Observatory'). In line with the Council's request of 2008, the Observatory in its current form is a centre of expertise with no legal personality managed by the Commission services. The latest Council Resolution relating to the Observatory added further responsibilities, by inviting it to assess the needs for implementation of EU-level training programmes for those involved in combating counterfeiting and piracy. A September 2010 European Parliament Resolution additionally called for the Observatory to compile scientific research data on counterfeiting and IPR regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 and 118(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment looked at three different options, each with a number of sub-options: Option 1: the Observatory continues to be administered by DG MARKT, but with extra resources: Sub-option 1a – DG MARKT’s human and budgetary resources are increased. Sub-option 1b – The management of the Observatory is outsourced to an external contractor. Option 2: tasks are performed by a private body or jointly under a public-private partnership: Sub-option 2a – Industry-led initiative, financed by private sector stakeholders. Sub-option 2b – Industry-led initiative, financed by a Commission grant/programme. Sub-option 2c – Public-private partnership (PPP). Option 3: the Observatory is entrusted to an EU agency: Sub-option 3a – The tasks of the Observatory are entrusted to a newly created EU agency. Sub-option 3b – The tasks of the Observatory are entrusted to an existing agency. In budgetary terms it would offer a cost-efficient solution (with total costs of between EUR 3.3 million and 4.3 million in the first two years and between EUR 4.74 million and 5.52 million as of year three) and allow costs to be covered by financial resources outside of the EU budget. The Commission concludes that Option 3b (entrusting the tasks to an existing EU agency, preferably OHIM) is the preferred option. It would allow the Observatory to have access to expertise, resources and financing and to become quickly operational. In budgetary terms it would offer a cost-efficient solution and allow costs to be covered by financial resources outside of the EU budget. CONTENT: over the last two years, the Observatory's institutional framework has been set up. This setting up phase of the Observatory having been concluded it shows that, due to a lack of funding, human resources, IT and meeting capacities and necessary expertise, with its current infrastructure it will not be able to meet its objectives in the future and that the taking on of additional tasks under the current setting would be excluded. It is proposed to entrust the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market with the tasks and activities relating to the management of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, including those concerning copyright, rights related to copyright and patents. The specific objectives are: to make public authorities and private stakeholders more aware of counterfeiting and piracy as regards their scope, impact and trends, and effective techniques to combat the problem and to improve day-to-day cooperation; to inform consumers of the economic impact and dangers related to counterfeiting and piracy and to help them avoid being misled into buying fake products; to improve the coordination of actions directed towards third countries. The operational objectives are to ensure that the Observatory has the necessary infrastructure (in terms of human resources, funding, IT and meeting capacities, expertise and independence from vested interests) to perform its tasks effectively, as quickly as possible and at minimum cost to the EU budget. These objectives dovetail with existing EU policies and strategies, such as Europe 2020. They also fit in with the Commission’s main priorities and proposals concerning its IPR strategy for Europe. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not create any costs for the EU budget. Instead, it would allow for savings of around EUR 40 000 as certain costs that are currently borne by the EU budget would in future be borne by the OHIM’s budget."
6907EP7,"""""Maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management""""",0.719,0.74,0.018,0.29,0.303,0.747,0.738,0.029,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a framework for maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management. PROPOSED ACT : Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the ultimate aim of maritime spatial planning is to draw up plans to identify the utilisation of maritime space for different sea uses. Maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management are complementary tools. Applied jointly, they improve sea-land interface planning and management. Increased use of coastal and maritime areas as well as climate change effects, natural hazards, and erosion, put pressure on coastal and marine resources. They require integrated and coherent management to secure sustainable growth and preserve coastal and marine ecosystems for future generations. In 2008, the Commission published its ‘Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning: achieving common principles in the EU’, followed by a 2010 Communication entitled ‘Maritime Spatial Planning in the EU — achievements and future development’. This draft directive is an essential part of the ambition to develop the EU’s Blue Economy as described in the Commission Communication on Blue growth: opportunities for marine and maritime sustainable growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment evaluated the effectiveness and the economic, environmental and social impacts of three options: (1) guidance and development of best practice, (2) non-binding measures, and (3) legally binding measures, including a ‘framework-type’ directive or regulation. The impact assessment concluded that, even though non-binding options offer some advantages, a legally binding approach by means of a directive is the most appropriate instrument in order to: ·  ensure predictability, stability, and transparency of maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management, whilst leaving flexibility for implementation to Member States and not interfering with the latter’s competences; ·  ensure that timelines for implementation are coherent with the timeframes of other relevant EU legislation and policy initiatives (e.g. Renewable Energy Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Europe 2020 targets, etc.); ·  foster growth of economic activities at sea in a context of increased competition for space. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 43(2), 100(2), 192(1), and 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the main purpose of the proposed directive is to promote the sustainable growth of maritime and coastal activities and the sustainable use of coastal and marine resources by establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management in the form of a systematic, coordinated, inclusive and trans-boundary approach to integrated maritime governance. To ensure the sustainability and environmental health of the various uses, maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management will have to employ an ecosystem-based approach that ensures the protection of the natural resources that provide the basis for carrying out various activities. The proposed action covers all policy areas of the TFEU with an impact on coasts, seas and oceans. The proposal: ·  obliges Member States to carry out maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management in accordance with national and international law. The aim of the action is for Member States to establish a process or processes that cover the full cycle of problem identification, information collection, planning, decision-making, management, monitoring of implementation, and stakeholder participation. Planning details and the determination of management objectives are left to Member States. The EU will not take part in this process; ·  requires Member States’ actions to aim for coherence of management across sea basins, through trans-boundary cooperation in the same marine region or sub-region and related coastal zone and appropriate data collection and exchange. Implementing acts will ensure consistent implementation of the Directive throughout the EU and facilitate reporting from the Member States to the Commission and, where relevant, the exchange of data between Member States and with the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
3989EP9,"""""Common agricultural policy - support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States and financed by the EAGF and by the EAFRD""""",0.839,0.863,0.0,0.822,0.474,0.815,0.539,0.171,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to modernise and simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 (regulation on the CAP strategic plans). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a single common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. CONTENT: this proposal lays down rules on the objectives to be pursued through Union support financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) under the CAP. It also defines the new working method covering direct payments to farmers, rural development support and sectoral support programmes. Objectives adapted to the new priorities : the CAP general objectives shall focus on the economic viability, the resilience and income of farms, on an enhanced environmental and climate performance, and on the strengthened socio-economic fabric of rural areas. The future CAP shall focus on nine specific objectives: support viable farm income and resilience across the EU territory to enhance food security; enhance market orientation and increase competitiveness including greater focus on research, technology and digitalisation; improve farmers' position in the value chain; contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as sustainable energy; foster sustainable development and efficient management of natural resources such as water, soil and air; contribute to the protection of biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services and preserve habitats and landscapes; attract young farmers and facilitate business development in rural areas; promote employment, growth, social inclusion and local development in rural areas, including bio-economy and sustainable forestry; improve the response of EU agriculture to societal demands on food and health, including safe, nutritious and sustainable food, as well as animal welfare. Moreover, fostering knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas is a cross-cutting objective. To deliver on these objectives Member States shall ensure simplification and performance of CAP support. Greater flexibility for Member States : Member States shall have a certain level of flexibility for transfers between allocations. The focus shall be less on rules and compliance and more on results and performance. This approach will give far greater freedom to Member States to decide how best to meet the common objectives at the same time as responding to the specific needs of their farmers, rural communities and society at large. Member States shall present their proposed interventions to achieve the EU specific objectives in a CAP strategic plan. In the plans, Member States shall set targets on what they want to achieve in the programming period using commonly defined result indicators. The Commission shall assess the proposed CAP strategic plans to ensure the consistency and coherence with the general principles of Union law and the protection of the internal market. Once the CAP strategic plans are established, Member States shall annually report on the progress made in the implementation. The Member States and Commission will monitor progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. Better targeting of aid : direct payments shall remain an essential part of the policy, as farmers' income needs to be supported to foster a smart and resilient agricultural sector. Priority shall be given to supporting small and medium-sized farms and young farmers. Income support should be targeted to genuine farmers. The proposal provides inter alia for: a reduction of payments as of EUR 60 000 and compulsory capping for payments above EUR 100 000 per farm, with the possibility for Member States to deduct labour costs from the amount of direct payments; the possibility of granting a higher level of support per hectare for small and medium-sized farms; the obligation for Member States to allocate at least 2% of their direct payment allocation to attract young farmers. Member States should be allowed to use part of their financial ceiling available for direct payments for coupled income support in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability, and/or quality in certain sectors and productions that are particularly important for social, economic or environmental reasons and undergo certain difficulties. More ambitious environmental and climate objectives : direct payments shall be conditional on increased environmental and climate requirements. A new system of so-called ‘eco-schemes’, funded from national direct payment allocations, will be mandatory for Member States, although farmers will not be obliged to join them. These eco-schemes will have to address the CAP environment and climate objectives in ways that complement the other relevant tools available and go beyond what is already requested under the conditionality requirements. Member States will be required to dedicate at least 30% of their rural development budget to environment and climate measures. 40% of the total CAP budget shall contribute to climate action. For rural development, it is proposed to rebalance the financing between the EU and Member States’ budgets. Less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain interventions such as LEADER and the payments for management commitments. Member States shall have the possibility to transfer up to 15% of respective direct payments to EAFRD allocation and vice versa. A higher percentage can be transferred from direct payments to EAFRD allocation for interventions addressing environmental and climate objectives and installation grants for young farmers. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 by Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 with the main objective of showing solidarity with and providing support to workers affected by redundancies resulting from changes in world trade patterns. In the light of the scale and the speed of development of the financial and economic crisis in 2008, the Commission, in its European Economic Recovery Plan, envisaged the revision of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. The aim of this revision, brought about by Regulation (EC) No 546/2009, was to extend the scope of the EGF as part of Europe's crisis response and to turn it into an early, more effective crisis intervention instrument in line with the fundamental principles of solidarity and social justice. The amendments included permanent changes, such as the reduction from 1 000 to 500 of the required number of redundancies to trigger an application for EGF support and an extension from 12 to 24 months of the implementation period for EGF supported measures. A temporary derogation was introduced in order (1) to enlarge the scope of the EGF to cover support in favour of workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the financial and economic crisis (paragraph 1a of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006) and (2) to increase the level of EGF co-funding from 50 to 65% (Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006). The temporary derogation expires on 30 December 2011 and the possibility of reviewing it is provided for in the second paragraph of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. Therefore, it is proposed to extend the temporary crisis-related derogation, which expires on 30 December 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 175(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in order to extend the temporary derogation to support workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis the date laid down in the second paragraph of paragraph 1a of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 is replaced by 31 December 2013. This amendment also automatically extends the increased co-financing rate of 65% until the same date, as laid down in Article 10(1) of the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: Article 28 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006on budgetary discipline and sound financial management provides that the EGF may not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 500 million. Based on the requests for EGF support in the past the proposed extension of the crisis related derogation in Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 is not expected to exceed this maximum annual amount. These requests reached EUR 51.8 million in 2007 and EUR 20.6 million in 2008. In 2009 the total amount of EGF support requested reached EUR 131.7 million, of which 75% concerned crisis related applications and 25% trade related applications. In 2010 the total amount of EGF support requested reached EUR 132,5 million, of which 87% related to crisis related applications and 13% to trade related applications."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the two-way carriage of passengers and goods by road between Switzerland and the EU is regulated by the Land Transport Agreement between the EU and Switzerland ('EU Agreement'). Under the EU Agreement, the transport of passengers by coach and bus between two points situated on the territory of the same Contracting Party by carriers established in the territory of the other Contracting Party, known as cabotage, is not authorised. This means that the carriers operating the passenger services which cross the border can only carry passengers across the border or within the territory of the Contracting Party they are established in. Bus and coach operators established in Switzerland may not carry passengers between two points on the German side of the border and operators established in the EU may not carry passengers between two points on the Swiss side of the border. However, Article 20(2) of the EU Agreement specifically allows pre-existing rights under bilateral agreements concluded between individual EU Member States and Switzerland that were in force at the time of conclusion of the EU Agreement to continue to be exercised. The border regions of Germany and Switzerland are closely integrated. Many Germans commute to work in Switzerland and vice versa and there is vibrant cross-border passenger traffic by road. A number of bus and coach services are offered which cross the border and thus connect the border regions of the two countries. By letter dated 11 May 2017, Germany informed the Commission that it would appreciate if the Union was to empower it to amend its bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland of 1953 with a view to authorising cabotage operations during the provision of passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border region between the two countries. Switzerland informed the Commission that it was also interested in amending this agreement to that effect. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to empower Germany to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the respective border regions of Germany and Switzerland in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between the two countries, provided that there is no discrimination between carriers established in the Union and no distortion of competition. Cabotage operations allow increasing the load factor of the vehicles which increases the economic efficiency of the services. The authorisation of cabotage operations in the context of the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between Germany and Switzerland would allow the carriers involved to become more competitive and efficient. In order to ensure that the cabotage operations concerned do not excessively alter the functioning of the internal market for coach and bus services, as established by Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, their authorisation should be subject to the conditions that there is no discrimination between carriers established within the Union and no distortion of competition. For the same reason, cabotage operations should only be authorised in the border regions of Germany in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between Germany and Switzerland. As border regions of Germany shall be considered the administrative districts of Freiburg and Tübingen in Baden-Württemberg and the administrative district of Swabia in Bavaria. This proposal is based on a request by Germany and concerns only this Member State. A similar request has been received by Italy which is subject to a parallel procedure."

BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In the absence of an agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom governing the matter, there would be no legal basis for the provision of air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States by the respective carriers after the end of the transition period under the withdrawal agreement. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The disruption of air transport connectivity would represent the loss of a strategic asset for the EU and the Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to ensure the provision of certain air services between the United Kingdom and the European Union for a limited period of 6 months (until 30 June 2021) if no agreement governing this area can be reached, provided that the United Kingdom does the same. The proposal provides for: - the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories; - the possibility for UK carriers to provide those services by means of code-sharing or blocked-space arrangements, and to enter into leasing arrangements under strict conditions; - a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by Union carriers in the United Kingdom stay equivalent to those granted to UK carriers under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts; - the establishment of a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union air carriers enjoy fair and equal conditions of competition with United Kingdom carriers once the United Kingdom is no longer bound by Union law; - the establishment of procedures to enable Member States to verify that air carriers, aircraft and crews entering their territory under the Regulation are licensed or certified by the United Kingdom in accordance with internationally recognised safety standards."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication ‘A Budget for Europe 2020’  the Commission recognised the need to provide, for the duration of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014 – 2020, specific, one-off support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes triggered by the increasing globalisation of production and trade patterns. As in the 2007-2013 programming period, this specific support should be provided through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), one of the existing special instruments whose mobilisation does not affect the expenditure ceilings of the MFF. In the same Communication the Commission indicated that through the EGF the Union should also be able to provide support in the event of large-scale redundancies resulting from a serious disruption of the local, regional or national economy caused by an unexpected crisis. The scope of the EGF will furthermore be extended to provide transitory support to farmers to facilitate their adaptation to a new market situation resulting from the conclusion by the Union of trade agreements affecting agricultural products. The prime objective of this proposal is to ensure that the EGF continues to operate in the next programming period in line with the basic principles laid down for the MFF 2014 – 2020, which also extended its scope. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considered three options for the EGF: Option 1 – No policy change , i.e. the EGF continues without its own budget. Following each application the budgetary authority has to take a decision whether this particular situation merits support. The main disadvantage is the long delay caused by the administrative procedures surrounding the decision- making process. The main advantages are the flexibility of the instrument, in particular taking into account the largely unpredictable nature of the expenditure, the awareness it raises in the European Parliament of mass redundancies, the high visibility of each application as well as the high visibility of the EGF itself. Option 2 – Incorporation of EGF actions into the ESF. The main disadvantages are the need for a clear budget allocation during the programming period despite the 'unprogrammable' nature of mass redundancies, the possible conflict with overall allocation criteria used in cohesion policy and a reduction of the political visibility of Union support as the budgetary authority would not be involved. The main advantages of this option are increased coherence and complementarity with the ESF, the shortening of the decision-making process and the simplification and streamlining of EGF applications as the EGF could benefit from ESF structures, procedures, management and control systems as well as ESF simplifications in areas such as eligible costs. Option 3 – the EGF as a stand-alone fund with its own budgetary allocation . The main disadvantages are the loss of budgetary flexibility as it would earmark for a variable expenditure pattern a fixed amount of expenditure, the delivery mechanism (a negative impact on the delivery mechanism compared with option 2 as the EGF would not benefit from ESF structures, procedures and simplification) and finally the risk of some overlap with the ESF. The main advantage is the high degree of visibility for European solidarity. The assessment has shown that in terms of speed of delivery of EGF assistance options 2 and 3 are preferable. However, these options involve a higher risk of reduced efficiency because of non-use of allocated resources. The involvement of policy makers in option 1 guarantees the highest level of public commitment of the Union to the welfare of redundant workers. Therefore, option 1 is the preferred option, offering as it does the necessary flexibility to enable effective use of resources, without affecting the Multiannual Financial Framework. LEGAL BASIS: the third paragraph of Article 175, as well as Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to ensure that the EGF continues to operate in the next programming period in line with the basic principles laid down for the MFF 2014-2020. The main provisions of this proposal may be summarised as follows: Scope : the EGF will provide support in cases: where workers have been made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns, in line with the initial scope of the EGF as laid down in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006; where workers made redundant as a result of a serious disruption of the local, regional or national economy caused by an unexpected crisis (comparable to the financial and economic crisis that hit the economy from 2008 onwards) provided that a direct and demonstrable link can be established between the redundancies and that crisis; to help farmers adjust to a new market situation resulting from a trade agreement, such as an agreement on agricultural products concluded by the Union. Examples of such possible forthcoming trade agreements are those under negotiation with Mercosur countries, or in the context of the World Trade Organisation under the Doha Development Agenda. Intervention criteria : in order to ensure that the EGF remains a valid European-level instrument, an application for EGF support for workers can be triggered when the number of redundancies reaches a minimum threshold. Experience with the functioning of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 has shown that a threshold of 500 redundancies within a given reference period is acceptable, in particular taking into account the possibility to submit applications for a lower number of redundancies in small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances. For the agricultural sector ,an EGF application would be triggered on a different basis. Ex-ante information about the sectors and / or products likely to be affected by increased imports as a direct result of trade agreements will be provided in the analysis carried out by the Commission departments for the trade negotiations. Once the trade agreement is initialled, the Commission departments further check the sectors or products for which a substantial increase in Union imports and a significant drop in prices are expected and will assess the likely effect on sectoral income. On this basis the Commission would designate agricultural sectors or products and, where relevant, regions as eligible for possible EGF support. Member States would have the possibility to submit applications for an EGF contribution, provided that they can prove that eligible sectors experience significant trade-related losses, that farmers operating in these sectors are affected and that they have identified and targeted the affected farmers. As the access to EGF support is conditioned by the fact that the workers must have been made redundant, or for farmers that they are adjusting that part of their activity affected by the relevant trade agreement, the proposal contains specific provisions on how the redundancy should be counted for each worker. Revision of the notion of ‘workers’ : in order to ensure that EGF support is available to workers independently of their contract of employment or employment relationship, the notion of 'workers' is extended to include not only workers with contracts of employment of indefinite duration as in Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, but also workers with fixed-term contracts, temporary agency workers and owner-managers of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed workers (including farmers). The EGF is designed to contribute to the growth and employment objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Therefore, its focus is on active labour market measures aimed at reintegrating dismissed workers rapidly into stable employment. As does Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, this proposal provides for a financial contribution from the EGF for a package of active labour market measures. It cannot contribute to the funding of passive measures as these are not compatible with the growth and employment objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Allowances may only be included if they are designed as incentives to facilitate the participation of dismissed workers in active labour market policy measures. In order to ensure a reasonable balance between genuinely active labour market policy measures and 'activated' allowances, the share of allowances in a coordinated package of active labour market measures is capped. For farmers , including all members of the farm household active on the farm, the measures would focus on the acquisition of appropriate training and skills and use of advisory services enabling them to adjust their activities, including carrying out new activities, within and / or outside agriculture, as well as to support to a limited extent the initial investments in changing or adjusting their activities so as to assist them to become structurally more competitive and secure their livelihoods. Support could also be given to cooperation activities with a view to creating new market options especially for small-scale farmers. Application and intervention deadlines : the effectiveness of the EGF has suffered from the length and procedural requirements of the decision-making process. Shortening as much as possible the time lag between the date of application for EGF support and the date of payment, and simplifying the procedures, should be a common concern for all parties involved in the EGF process: Member States should strive to submit a complete application as soon as possible once the relevant criteria are met; the Commission should assess and conclude on eligibility soon after the submission of a complete application; the budgetary authority should swiftly take its decision on deploying the EGF funding. In order to cover the needs arising at the beginning of the year, the Commission will continue to propose within the annual budgetary procedure a minimum amount in payment appropriations for the relevant budgetary line. In view of the unpredictable nature of the needs arising for support from the Fund, it is necessary to reserve a part of the annual maximum amount for applications receiving financial contributions after 1 September each year. In case the needs for support from the Fund exceed the amount remaining available, the Commission’s proposals will reflect the proportion set for support of the agricultural sector during the duration of the MFF. Complementarity, compliance and coordination : assistance from the EGF will be in addition to the efforts of the Member States, at national, regional and local levels. For reasons of sound financial management the EGF cannot replace measures that are already covered by Union Funds and Programmes included in the MFF. Nor can the EGF financial contribution replace measures that are the responsibility of dismissing companies under national law or collective agreements. Budget procedure : the budget procedure in the proposal follows directly from point 13 of the draft Interinstitutional Agreement. Whenever possible, the process will be shortened and streamlined. Taking account of the fact that the measures co-funded by the EGF are implemented by means of shared management with the Member States, the payment mechanism for the financial contribution will remain in line with those applied for this management mode of the Union budget. At the same time, the financing arrangements should reflect the scope of the actions to be carried out by the Member States as proposed in their applications. The co-funding rate will be modulated, with a 50% contribution to the cost of the package and its implementation as the norm, and the possibility to raise this rate to 65% in the case of applications submitted by those Member States on the territory of which at least one region at NUTS II level is eligible under the ""Convergence"" objective of the Structural Funds. The purpose of this modulation is to ensure that the Union’s expression of solidarity with workers in these Member States and regions is not hampered by a lack of Member State co-funding resources, as recognised by the higher co-funding rates laid down under the Structural Funds. The Commission, in its assessment of such applications, will decide whether the higher co-funding rate is justified in the specific case proposed by the Member State. One of the key messages for the period 2014-2020 is that expenditure at Union level should be result-oriented, thus ensuring that the output and impact of the expenditure push forward the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and the achievement of its targets. For expenditure related to the EGF the MFF sets the target that at least 50% of workers assisted through the EGF should find a new and stable job after 12 months. Implementing reports : Member States will present an interim report on the implementation of EGF support after 15 months. Within the same results-oriented approach the proposal provides for the possibility that Member States, subject to approval by the Commission, can amend the planned active labour market policy measures if in the course of the 24-month implementation period other measures become more relevant and promising to reach a higher reintegration rate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EGF is one of the special instruments not included in the MFF, with a maximum amount from January 2014 to 31 December 2020 of EUR 3 billion, while the amount in support of the agricultural sector shall not exceed EUR 2.5 billion (2011 prices). It may not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 429 million. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."

BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries applies to imports of textile products originating in third countries, with which the European Community has concluded bilateral agreements, signed protocols or made other arrangements. In recent years, the European Union only maintained bilateral agreements on trade in textiles with Russia and Serbia. After Russia's accession to the WTO and the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 lost its main purpose. Moreover, Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 was used to impose quantitative limits to certain textiles products originating from the People's Republic of China during a limited period and to eventually use the transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism for China. This mechanism expired on 11 December 2013. Therefore, it is necessary to repeal this Regulation.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: digital services cover a wide range of daily activities including online intermediation services, such as online marketplaces, online social networking services, online search engines, operating systems or software application stores. They increase consumer choice, improve efficiency and competitiveness of industry and can enhance civil participation in society. However, whereas over 10 000 online platforms operate in Europe’s digital economy, most of which are SMEs, a small number of large online platforms capture the biggest share of the overall value generated. These large platforms increasingly act as gateways or gatekeepers between business users and end users and enjoy an entrenched and durable position. The proposed Digital Markets Act aims at preventing gatekeepers from imposing unfair conditions on businesses and consumers and at ensuring the openness of important digital services. Common rules across the single market are needed to foster innovation, growth and competitiveness, and facilitate the scaling up of smaller platforms, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups who will have a single, clear framework at EU level. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the aim of the proposed regulation is to lay down harmonised rules ensuring contestable and fair markets in the digital sector across the EU where gatekeepers are present. It should apply to core platform services provided or offered by gatekeepers to business users established in the EU or end users established or located in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment or residence of the gatekeepers and irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the provision of service. Its main objectives are: - to address market failures to ensure contestable and competitive digital markets for increased innovation and consumer choice; - to address gatekeepers’ unfair conduct; - to enhance coherence and legal certainty to preserve the internal market. Specific provisions of the proposal The proposal: - should only apply to large companies that would be designated as ‘gatekeepers’. For this purpose, it contains the provisions concerning the designation of gatekeepers. More specifically, it establishes the conditions under which providers of core platform services should be designated as gatekeepers either based on the quantitative criteria (through a presumption subject to counter-demonstration) or following a case-by-case assessment during a market investigation; - sets out the practices of gatekeepers that limit contestability and that are unfair; - provides rules for carrying out market investigations: (i) designation of a gatekeeper; (ii) investigation of systematic non-compliance and (iii) investigation of new core platform services and new practices; - contains the provisions concerning the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation. These include the Commission's ability to request information, to conduct interviews and make statements and on-site inspections, to adopt interim measures and to make voluntary measures binding on the gate-keepers. In case of non-compliance, the Commission can issue non-compliance decisions, as well as impose fines and periodic penalty payments for breaches of the Regulation. Budgetary implications The total financial resources necessary for the implementation of the proposal in the 2021-2027 period should amount to EUR 81.090 million, including EUR 50.640 million of administrative costs and EUR 30.450 million entirely covered by the allocations foreseen in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 under the financial envelopes of the Single Market Programme and the Digital Europe Programme. The financing should support inter alia activities such as carrying out the designation of providers of core platform services, carrying out market investigations and performing any other investigative actions, enforcement actions and monitoring activities."
2147EP7,"""""Professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States""""",0.789,0.886,0.877,0.581,0.182,0.952,0.856,0.771,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to allow professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between participating Member States under conditions that guarantee the security of the transaction, the safety of the staff involved and of the public and the free movement of currency. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the introduction of the euro has considerably increased the need for cross-border transportation of cash by road. However, due to incompatibilities between national legislations it is in most cases very difficult for professional cash transporters to move euro cash between euro-area Member States and very little cross-border land transportation therefore takes place. Regulatory differences concern a wide range of issues such as the possession and carrying of firearms by the cash-in-transit (CIT) staff, authorised transport modalities, armouring and equipment of the CIT-vehicles, number of staff in the vehicles etc. The current regulatory obstacles moreover imply a fragmentation of the single market in this sector. The European Central Bank, the banking sector and the large retail sector have repeatedly called for the launch of an initiative aimed at lifting the obstacles to the professional cross border transportation by road of euro cash in Europe. On this basis, the Commission adopted a White Paper on professional cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between Member States in the euro area in May 2009. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five broad options were considered: Option 1 : a baseline no-change scenario; Option 2 : bilateral/multilateral agreements between those Member States potentially most concerned by cross-border transports; Option 3 : a set of common rules for cross-border transports only; Option 4 : full mutual recognition; and Option 5 : full harmonisation of the regulation of all CIT-transport. The detailed analysis of impacts concerns option 3: a set of common rules for cross-border transport. This option would meet the objective of facilitating the free circulation of euro cash. Since it is limited to cross-border transports it would furthermore not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives. Three sub-options are moreover considered: (i) extending the scope of the rules to EU Member States outside the current euro area; (ii) extending the scope to other cash and valuables; and (iii) restricting the scope to point-to-point transports only. As regards the sub-options, it is concluded that the common rules should apply also to the territory of EU Member States that are about to introduce the euro as from the date of the decision of the Council to abrogate their derogation from participating in the euro. LEGAL BASIS: Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Action at EU level brings important economies of scale as compared to bilateral or multilateral action. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down a set of common rules for the professional cross-border transport of euro cash within the euro area. It is based on the principle of a specific cross-border CIT-licence which would be granted by the Member State of origin to CIT-companies whishing to transport euro cash across borders. Seven different authorised transport types are foreseen – five for the transport of banknotes and two for the transport of coins – with possibilities for Member Sates to opt out from specific options for their territory. In terms of scope, the following elements are noteworthy: the proposed Regulation would apply to the professional transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States. It is also foreseen that the territory of Member States which have not yet introduced the euro are covered by the Regulation as from the date of the Council decision to abrogate their derogation from participating in the euro. The extension of the scope of the Regulation is the subject of a separate proposed Regulation; the proposed Regulation would apply both to so-called point-to-point transports (i.e. transports from one secure location to another secure location with no intermediate stops) and so-called retail transports of cash (multi-stops transports servicing final customers); for retail transports, the majority of the stops must take place in the host Member State(s), whereas there is no limit to the number of stops that can be made in either the Member State of origin or the host Member State; the transports must as a rule be carried out during daytime, with exceptions foreseen for point-to point transports; the CIT-vehicle must return to its Member State of origin within the same day. The CIT cross-border licence : C IT-companies whishing to undertake cross-border transport of cash under the terms of the Regulation must apply for a specific licence from the granting authority of their Member State of origin. To obtain the licence, the company, its management and its staff will have to meet a certain number of conditions laid down in the Regulation. In case of infringement of the rules, the sanctioning power belongs to the authority that granted the licence, i.e. the authority of the Member State of origin. However, safeguarding powers are granted to the Member State crossed or the host Member State in case of emergency or manifest breaches of the rules (e.g. minimum number of staff not respected, infringement of the rules on the carrying of weapons etc). Member States furthermore have a duty of mutual information on all these aspects. Authorised transport types F or banknotes , the following five transport types would be authorised for the cross-border transport of cash: transportation of banknotes in an unarmoured vehicle of ordinary appearance equipped with a system of neutralisation of banknotes (IBNS); transportation of banknotes in an unarmoured vehicle with a clear marking indicating that it is equipped with IBNS; transportation of banknotes in a cabin-armoured vehicle equipped with IBNS; transportation of banknotes in a fully-armoured vehicle not equipped with IBNS; transportation of banknotes in a fully-armoured vehicle equipped with IBNS. For coins , the following two transport types are foreseen: transportation of coins in an unarmoured vehicle; transportation of coins in a cabin-armoured vehicle. In all cases, there must be at least two security staff in the vehicle, except for transport in a fully-armoured vehicle without IBNS where three security staff are required. Member States may choose to close down the use of certain options for their territory as long as they accept at least one of the above-listed options for banknotes and one of the above-listed options for coins and as long as they do not allow comparable transport modalities for domestic CIT-transports. Application of national rules : in particularly sensitive areas from the point of view of security, national rules would continue to apply. These areas concern the carrying and use of weapons, the relationship with the police forces and the rules governing the behaviour of the CIT security staff outside the CIT-vehicle as well as the security of the locations where the cash is delivered or picked up. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no negative impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth assigns a prominent role to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (set up by Regulation (EC) 294/2008) which contributes to a number of flagship initiatives. During the period 2014-2020, the EIT will contribute to the general objective of "" Horizon2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, by integrating the knowledge triangle of higher education, research and innovation. This integration takes place primarily via the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together organisations on a long-term basis around societal challenges. However, given its integrated, cross–cutting nature, synergies will also be sought with other pillars, in particular the ""competitiveness"" pillar. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. On the other hand, the preparation of the proposal took account of the responses to the open consultations on the EIT. Views were expressed by the Member States and a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and civil society. It showed a strong support to the mission of the EIT to drive more and better cooperation between the worlds of academia, entrepreneurship, research and innovation. According to respondents: the EIT should play a distinctive role in 'Horizon 2020', the future EU Programme for Research and Innovation, and forge closer links with other European and national efforts; a majority of respondents praised the way in which the EIT ensures the participation of businesses in its work and urged the Institute to step up its outreach activities. Moreover, respondents considered business involvement as highly relevant for the future success of the EIT. Flexibility, clarity on rules and clear returns on investment is therefore fundamental in order to attract private sector participation; the proposal also relies on the external evaluation report in which the concept of integrating the knowledge triangle is regarded as highly relevant and the themes around which the EIT is structured are well-received; there is much support for the model which has been developed by the EIT, based around integrated networks of co-location centres. Respondents were also positive, and consistent, in their perspective that the value of the KICs was in acting as a catalyst to secure additional value from the activities which individual members already undertook. LEGAL BASIS: Article 173 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal will be implemented as centralised indirect management. The proposed amendments are based on several sources: lessons learnt during the initial period, the proposal for the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda, which builds on the proposal of the EIT Governing Board, the recommendations of the external evaluation report and Commission opinion on the evaluation, as well as the results of broad consultations with EIT stakeholders. The main amendments proposed are as follows: the financial contribution from Horizon 2020 to the EIT will be implemented in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in ""Horizon 2020"" . The EIT funding to the KICs will cover ""KIC added value activities"", however the KICs or their partner organisations may apply to other schemes under Horizon 2020 or European Union programmes in accordance with their respective rules and on equal footing with other applications; the EIT should directly engage with national and regional representatives and other stakeholders from across the innovation chain, generating beneficial effects on both sides. In order to render such dialogue and exchange more systematic, an EIT Stakeholder Forum should be organised, bringing together the wider community of stakeholders around crosscutting issues; the scope of the EIT contribution to the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (hereinafter referred to as KICs) should be defined and the origins of KICs' financial resources clarified; the composition of the EIT bodies should be simplified . The functioning of the EIT Governing Board should be streamlined and the respective roles and tasks of the Governing Board and the Director should be further clarified; new KICs , including their priority fields and the organisation and timing of the selection process, should be launched on the basis of modalities defined in the Strategic Innovation Agenda; cooperation on the organisation the monitoring and evaluations of the KICs between the Commission and the EIT is required to ensure coherence with overall EU level monitoring and evaluation system; in order to assure broader participation of organizations from different Members States in the KICs, the partner organizations should be established in at least three different Member States; the criteria and procedures for the financing, monitoring and evaluation of the activities of the KICs should be adopted by the EIT prior to launching the KIC selection process; the EIT Triennial Work Programme should take into account the Commission's opinion concerning the EIT's specific objectives, as defined in Horizon 2020, and its complementarities with European Union policies and instruments; the EIT, being under Horizon 2020, will be part of the mainstreaming of climate change expenditures as defined in Horizon 2020; the evaluation of the EIT should provide timely input to the evaluation of Horizon 2020 in 2017 and 2023; the Commission should strengthen its role in monitoring the implementation of specific aspects of EIT activities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: during the period 2014-2020 a financial contribution of EUR 3.182.230 million (current prices) for the EIT will be provided from Horizon 2020, the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress has been achieved in the past 20 years in the Union in the field of anthropogenic air emissions and air quality by a dedicated Union policy, including the 2005 Communication from the Commission ""Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution”. Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has been instrumental in this progress by setting caps on Member States' total annual emissions for 2010 onwards of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC). As a result, SO2 emissions were reduced by 82%, NOx emissions by 47%, NMVOC emissions by 56% and NH3 emissions by 28% between 1990 and 2010. However, as indicated in the ""Clean Air Programme for Europe"" (""revised TSAP""), significant adverse impacts and risks remain on the environment and human health. There is a need to review and update these requirements to address the highly significant remaining health risks and environmental impacts posed by air pollution in the Union, and to align Union law with new international commitments following a revision of the Gothenburg Protocol in 2012. The revised TSAP sets out new strategic objectives for the period up to 2030 with a view to moving further towards the Union's long-term objective. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment modelled the optimal delivery of the desired reduction, and this optimisation yielded national emission reduction commitments for the six most relevant pollutants. These reduction commitments will reduce total external costs of air pollution by EUR 40 billion (on the most conservative valuation) compared to the EUR 212 billion in the baseline, including direct economic benefits amounting to more than EUR 2.8 billion. The baseline shall deliver in 2030 a reduction of health burden by 40% as compared to 2005. This proposal delivers an extra 12%, which makes a 52% reduction in total regarding health burden as compared to 2005. For eutrophication, it delivers an extra 50% on top of the baseline. CONTENT: the proposal repeals and replaces the current Union regime on the annual capping of national emissions of air pollutants, as defined in Directive 2001/81/EC. By doing so: it ensures that the national emission ceilings (NECs) set in Directive 2001/81/EC for 2010 onwards for SO2, NOx, NMVOC and NH3 shall apply until 2020; establishes new national emission reduction commitments (""reduction commitments"") applicable from 2020 and 2030 for SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, fine particulate matter (PM2,5) and methane (CH4) as well as intermediate emission levels for the year 2025 applicable to the same pollutants. National reduction commitments : the proposal provides that the Member States must limit their annual emissions of SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, PM2,5 and CH4, to meet their reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, Member States must limit in 2025 their annual emissions of those pollutants to the levels defined on the basis of a linear reduction trajectory, unless this would require measures entailing disproportionate costs. The proposal also indicates what emission sources should not be accounted for. Flexibilities : the proposal entitles Member States to use certain flexibilities, provided that the Commission does not object: to account for a share of NOx, SO2, and PM2,5 emission reductions achieved by international maritime traffic under certain conditions; to implement jointly their reduction commitments for CH4; and to propose adjusted emission inventories when non-compliance with a reduction commitment (save for CH4) results from improved inventory methodology. In addition, the proposal: requires the Member States to adopt, implement and regularly update their national air pollution control programmes (NAPCPs) describing how their reduction commitments shall be met; requires Member States to monitor air pollutant emissions and, in so doing, prepare and update national emission inventories and projections to be accompanied by an informative inventory report (IIR); states that Member States shall monitor, where practicable, the adverse impacts of air pollution upon water and terrestrial ecosystems; requires Member States to communicate to the Commission, at the dates specified, their NAPCP and any updates and all monitoring information; the Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency and Member States, shall regularly verify the accuracy and completeness of reported national emission inventory data; seeks to promote cooperation between the Commission and Member States with third countries and relevant international organisations to further and better address air pollutant emissions at a global level; lays down the provisions on penalties applicable to breaches of the national provisions enacted pursuant to the proposal, on the entry into force and the transposition of the proposal into Member States’ legislation; provides that the Commission shall report every five years on the implementation of this Directive. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values. The proposed new Horizon Europe programme builds on the success of the previous framework programme, Horizon 2020. Horizon 2020 has already attracted the world’s best research institutions and researchers, supported 340 000 researchers, and developed Europe’s skilled human capital. Scientific publications from Horizon 2020 are world class and have contributed to major scientific breakthroughs. Specifically, Horizon Europe shall strengthen the EU’s scientific and technological bases in order to help tackle the major global challenges of our time and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At the same time, the programme shall boost the Union’s competitiveness and help deliver on the Union’s strategic priorities. According to the Commission, the new programme is expected to increase GDP on average by 0.08% to 0.19% over 25 years and directly generate an estimated gain of up to 100 000 jobs in R&I activities in the ‘investment phase’ (2021-2027). The economic activity generated by the Programme is expected to foster an indirect gain of up to 200 000 jobs over 2027-2036, of which 40% will be highly skilled. The proposal is in line with the headline target of investing 3% of the EU’s GDP on research and development. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Horizon Europe research and innovation framework programme for the period 2021-2027 and lays down the rules for participation and dissemination of results applicable to indirect actions carried out under the programme. The programme’s general objective is to deliver scientific, economic and societal impact from the Union’s investments in research and innovation in order to: (i) strengthen the scientific and technological bases of the Union and foster its competitiveness, including in its industry; (ii) to deliver on the Union strategic priorities; (iii) contribute to tackling global challenges, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ has a more ‘top down’ directed approach addressing Union and global policy and competitiveness challenges and opportunities. These are integrated into five clusters (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. Alongside the regular calls for proposals, a limited set of highly visible missions shall be introduced. These will be designed in the context of a strategic planning process. Missions, with ambitious but time-bound and achievable goals, should speak to the public and engage it where relevant. They will be co-designed with Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ shall essentially focus on scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation by establishing a European Innovation Council, support the enhancement of European ecosystems of innovation and continued support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The European Innovation Council shall offer a one-stop-shop to high-potential innovators. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology shall complement the European Innovation Council by promoting sustainable innovation ecosystems and developing entrepreneurial and innovation skills in priority areas through its knowledge and innovation communities. The three pillars shall be underpinned by activities to strengthening the European Research Area, specifically: sharing excellence to fully exploit the potential in less R&I performing countries. Cross-cutting elements : the Commission proposes to: significantly strengthen international cooperation by extending association agreements to include countries with excellent science, technology and innovation capacities; make the principle of open science the modus operandi of the new programme by requiring open access to publications and data which shall accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation; rationalise the current plethora of European partnerships so that they can continue in simplified forms that are open to all (such as academia, industry, Member States, and philanthropic foundations). These partnerships shall be designed on the basis of Union added value, transparency, openness, impact, leverage effect; enhance synergies with other EU programmes to promote faster dissemination and uptake of research and innovation results. Rules for participation and dissemination : these shall have the following new features: (i) continuation of the principle of a single set of rules for participation and dissemination through further improvements; (ii) maintenance of ‘Horizon 2020’ funding rates; (iii) simplification of the cost reimbursement scheme, in particular the actual costs scheme for personnel costs; (vi) increased emphasis on exploitation and dissemination of results, particularly in the Union; (vi) communication by beneficiaries of Union funds, including to the public and the media. For Horizon Europe, the award criteria shall be excellence; impact; and quality and efficiency of the implementation. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the Framework Programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices. The indicative distribution of this amount shall be: EUR 25.80 billion for pillar I ‘Open Science’; EUR 52.70 billion for Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’; EUR 13.50 billion for pillar III ‘Open innovation’; EUR 2.10 billion for the part ‘Strengthening the European Research Area’."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: driving and resting times of drivers are regulated under EU law. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (the 'Driving Time Regulation') and Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on tachographs are part of a wider effort to improve the working conditions of drivers, ensure fair competition between operators and improve the road safety of European roads. An evaluation the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the existing set of Union social rules in road transport, identified certain deficiencies in the existing legal framework. Unclear and unsuitable rules on weekly rest, resting facilities, breaks in multi-manning and the absence of rules on the return of drivers to their home, lead to diverging interpretations and enforcement practices in the Member States. The objective of this proposal is to rectify the identified shortcomings and to help improve the working and business conditions in the sector in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a combination of two policy options: the first focused on strengthening enforcement, whilst the second established sector-specific criteria for posting workers in road transport and provides for specific enforcement measures. The impacts of the preferred option include improving the working and resting conditions of drivers (decrease in fatigue index by 28% and in periods away from home by 43% for EU-13 drivers and by 16% for EU-15 drivers). CONTENT: the proposal introduces a limited number of modifications to Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on driving time and Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on tachygraphs. Driving time : the main amendments proposed are as follows: private individuals using vehicles which would fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, to carry private belongings for their own purposes, are not obliged to record their driving times and rest periods and are therefore not obliged to have or use a tachograph or a driver's card; there is a uniform definition of the notion of 'non-commercial' carriage; drivers will have to record all tasks other than driving and also record any periods of availability; this will effectively monitor a driver's working patterns; drivers may arrange for their weekly rest periods in a more flexible manner over a period of four consecutive weeks, while ensuring that compensation for a reduced weekly rest is taken together with a regular weekly rest within three weeks. Any compensation for a reduced weekly rest must be attached to a regular weekly rest of at least 45 hours; a driver is not allowed to take a weekly rest of 45 hours or more in a vehicle. An employer is obliged to provide a driver with adequate accommodation with appropriate sleeping and hygiene facilities if drivers are not able to take a weekly rest at a private place of their choice; transport undertakings must organise the drivers' work in such a way that they are able to return to their home for a weekly rest at least once within three consecutive weeks; drivers may postpone the start of their weekly rest to reach their home provided that they comply with the daily and weekly driving time limits and with the required minimum duration of a weekly rest period; temporary exceptions from the general rules granted by Member States in urgent cases must be appropriately justified by the exceptional circumstances and the urgency involved in addressing them; Member States must inform the Commission about their national rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods applicable to the bus drivers exempted from the Regulation; national penalties imposed for infringing the Regulation should be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, as classified in relevant Union legislation. Tachygraph : the proposed amendments aim to improve the features of 'smart' tachographs to make it possible to more precisely position vehicles used for cross-border transport operations. The proposal adds an obligation on drivers to record in a tachograph the position of their vehicle after having crossed a border, at the earliest suitable stopping place."
4317EP7,"""""Staff Regulations of officials and Conditions of employment of other servants of the EU""""",0.018,0.927,0.0,0.258,0.333,0.867,0.887,0.114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Staff Regulations constitute the legal framework for employment and working conditions for the approximately 55 000 officials and other agents employed by more than fifty institutions and agencies located in different places of employment in the European Union and in third countries. Recent events in the global economy as well as the subsequent need to consolidate public finances cannot fail to have an impact on the European civil service and the administrations of all EU institutions, bodies and agencies. In this context, it is important to take account of a certain number of elements weighing on the administrative budget, in particular: the upcoming retirements in EU institutions, which will mainly affect staff from the 15 Member States of the Union before 2004, it will be a particular challenge to maintain the geographical balance of all Member States among staff; the demographic changes in Europe, attracting and retaining excellent staff from all Member States will be even more difficult in the future. The main amendments concern in particular the method of calculation of pensions, given that the current system weighs heavily on the administrative budget. The Commission proposal strikes the balance between cost-efficiency and the needs of the institutions in the field of human resource management. The European Commission considers that, if this proposal is adopted, the EU institutions will continue to be assisted by an independent, efficient and modern European civil service that will allow them to fulfil the tasks which they have been entrusted with by the treaties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 336 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 12 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union. CONTENT: the main elements of the proposal are as follows : - reducing staff by 5% : it is proposed to reduce the staff of each institution and agency by 5%, and this would be done by not replacing a certain number of departures, i.e. those who retire and those whose contracts come to an end; - method for adjusting salaries and pensions : the new method would preserve the principle of parallelism between the evolution of salaries of national officials and that of the EU officials, and would address the shortcomings of the current method: the new method would reflect nominal salary changes (instead of real salary changes) in all Member States. In this way the method will precisely follow salary changes in all Member States of the European Union and not only in a limited sample; in order to reduce the time lag in an extraordinary situation, the new exception clause would be automatically applied in case two conditions are met: 1) a decrease in the EU's GDP, and 2) the gap between the adjustment value of the remuneration and pensions of EU staff and the change in the EU's GDP exceeds two percentage points. If both conditions are fulfilled, half of the adjustment value would be postponed to the next year. For instance, this clause would have been triggered in 2009; the Brussels International Index would be suppressed. The differences in the increase in the cost of living between each place of employment and that of the Member States would be calculated and reflected in correction coefficients. A new joint correction coefficient would be introduced for Belgium and Luxemburg, considering these Member States as a single place of employment. It will be fixed at 100 for the first year. - solidarity levy : since 1982, the method has been linked to an additional tax on salaries, due to the effects of the oil crisis. Despite the improvement in the economic situation, this additional tax has not been phased out, but has become a measure linked to the automatic application of the method. It is suggested that, for the duration of the proposed method, the solidarity levy be increased at the rate of 6%; - modifications to the pension system in order to keep pace with demographic developments : increasing the normal retirement age to 65 years : currently, the normal retirement age is 63 years for officials recruited after 1 May 2004. Officials recruited before 1 May 2004 are subject to transitional provisions according to which the retirement age varies from 60 years to 63 years. It is proposed to increase the normal retirement age for officials recruited as of 1 January 2013 at 65 years. Similar transitional rules as those applied in 2004 would be implemented, i.e. the retirement age of officials recruited before 1 May 2013 would vary from 60 to 65 years. Furthermore, it will no longer be only on an exceptional basis that the possibility to continue working until 67 years would be granted; raising the age for early retirement to 58 years and reducing the number of officials benefiting from early retirement : currently, the minimum early retirement age is set at 55 years. Under the new proposal, the minimum early retirement age would be set at 58 years. In addition, the maximum number of officials retiring in a given year without a reduction of their pension rights would be fixed at 5% of the officials in all institutions who retired during the previous year (as opposed to 10% in the current system). This scheme is maintained since it has proven useful for all institutions as a HR management tool in the course of the last enlargement exercise; aligning the methodology for calculating the pension contribution rate to international actuarial practice : the computation system for the pension contribution rate expires on 30 June 2013. It is proposed to keep the same methodology, but to increase the moving average for interest rates and salary growth to 30 years. A transitional period of eight years would apply. - adapting the conditions of employment : it is proposed to: introducing a minimum number of weekly working hours : the 5% staff cut would require that every staff member take a share of the additional work burden, if the same policy objectives are to be achieved. It is therefore proposed to introduce in the Staff Regulations a minimum number of working hours per week, i.e. 40. maintaining flexitime working-time arrangements : flexible working-time arrangements allow reconciling work and private life and facilitate suitable gender balance within the Institutions while respecting the mandatory working time obligations. It is therefore appropriate to introduce a clear reference to these arrangements in the Staff Regulations. - allowances and entitlements : staff members are currently entitled to a maximum of six days per year of travelling time to their place of origin. It is proposed to limit the annual travelling time to a maximum of three days. The annual travel allowance is based on kilometric distance by railway, which is often not the most habitual route to travel to the place of origin. Therefore, the distance would be calculated as a great circle distance, which would have an effect of decreasing individual allowances. Furthermore, the payment of annual travel expenses would be limited to territories of the Member States of the EU. In order to reduce the administrative burden both for the staff members concerned and the administration, the rules on the reimbursement of removal costs should be simplified. It is therefore proposed to introduce cost ceilings which take account of the official's or agent's family situation and of the average cost of removal and associated insurance. The rules on mission should be adapted in order to take account of the specific need of an institution whose staff members must frequently go on mission to the principal places of work of their institution. It is proposed to allow in such cases the reimbursement of accommodation costs on the basis of a flat-rate sum; - transparency measures for Institutions and agencies : the Staff Regulations are implemented through a series of measures adopted by the Institutions and agencies. In order to ensure coherent and harmonised implementation of the Staff Regulations and for reasons of simplification, the Commission implementing rules would apply by analogy to agencies. However, in order to take account of the specific situation of agencies, they will be able, after receiving an authorisation from the Commission. - career of assistants, new career stream for secretaries and more flexibility in recruiting contract staff : reserving the highest grades for staff with the high level of responsibilities : in order to establish a clear link between responsibilities and grade, the career stream in the assistants' function group would be restructured in such a way to reserve the two highest grades (AST 10 and 11) only for officials and temporary agents who exercise significant responsibilities for staff management, budget implementation and/or coordination. new function group ""AST/SC"" for secretaries and clerical staff : a new function group ""AST/SC"" for secretarial and clerical staff should be introduced. Salaries and promotion rates proposed for this new function group establish a suitable correspondence between the level of responsibility and the level of remuneration. In this way it will be possible to preserve a stable, comprehensive and well-balanced European civil service, as considered necessary by many institutions. recruitment of contract staff : in order to give more flexibility to the institutions, the maximum length of contracts for auxiliary contract staff would be extended from 3 to 6 years. In addition, while the vast majority of officials will continue to be recruited on the basis of open competitions, the institutions would be authorised to organise internal competitions which are also open to contract staff. addressing unjustified geographical imbalances : the Staff Regulations stipulate that European Union officials are to be recruited on the broadest possible geographical basis. However, the statistical data show that, while some nationalities are overrepresented in comparison with the relative weight of their population in the European Union, others are largely under-represented. These imbalances are particularly noticeable in certain grades. Therefore, Article 27 of the Staff Regulations should be amended in order to allow the institutions to take measures correcting long lasting and significant geographical imbalances, while preserving the principle of recruitment based upon the highest standard of ability, efficiency and integrity. This measure shall be adopted by way of general implementing measures and shall be subject to a report after five years. - increasing efficiency in staff management for the agencies : t oday there are 45 structures (32 regulatory agencies, 7 joint undertakings and 6 executive agencies). In total, they employ almost 8 000 members of staff, mostly engaged as temporary agents. However, the provisions of the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants are not fully adapted to the needs of small structures such as agencies. For this reason the Commission suggests introducing a new category of temporary staff for agencies. They would be recruited following a transparent and objective selection procedure and could be engaged for an indefinite period of time. If necessary, agencies would be able to second them in the interests of the service. Also, temporary staff in agencies could take unpaid leave up to a maximum of 15 years throughout their entire career. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal would have a budgetary impact on the expenditure and revenue of the European Union. Due to transitional provisions, the financial impact of certain provisions would gradually increase and would reach its full effect only in the long term. The savings over the next multiannual financial framework are estimated to exceed EUR 1 billion. In the long run, the savings from the proposed amendments would be 1 billion Euros per year. More details are provided in the financial statement, which is annexed to this proposal."
3137EP7,"""""Exclusion of certain countries from trade preferences""""",0.0,0.037,0.825,0.484,0.424,0.711,0.81,0.543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE : to amend the list of countries that benefit from trade preferences by removing those which have still not taken the necessary steps towards ratification of an Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) from Annex I of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007. PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 granted a number of countries duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market under certain conditions. After the negotiation process of the EPA with the ACP regions was concluded in December of 2007, a number of countries were offered such access in anticipation of the steps towards ratification of an EPA. However, several countries have neither taken the necessary steps towards ratification of an EPA nor concluded comprehensive regional negotiations. Accordingly, the proposal intends to remove those countries which have not signed their Agreements or have not ratified their agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the following States have not taken steps towards the completion of their respective agreements and will be removed from Annex I of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007: Botswana; Burundi; Cameroon; the Comoros; Côte d’Ivoire; the Fiji Islands; Ghana; Haiti; Kenya; Lesotho; Mozambique; Namibia; Rwanda; Swaziland; Tanzania; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe. According to the criteria set out in Article 2(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, trade preferences granted to these countries should no longer be maintained. The Commission will continue to work with a view to ensuring that these countries become a contracting party to an EPA, and will use to the full the recent momentum of different negotiations to create a sustainable long term trade regime with these partners in keeping with the EPA negotiating directives and the priorities set out in the Cotonou Agreement. The Commission has informed the Council, the European Parliament, the ACP Group of States and civil society that the current situation is not sustainable, as duty-free quota-free market access is still granted to beneficiary countries which are not taking the necessary steps towards ratification of the agreements on which this access is based, thus removing the justification for its advance provisional application. Delegated acts: should the countries removed from Annex I take the necessary steps towards ratification of an EPA, they would continue to benefit from the respective trade preferences and could therefore be re-instated in the Annex as soon as possible in order to provide continuity of their market access. To this end the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU for the purpose of amending Annex I in order to reinstate these countries. The proposal states that the delegation of power shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time and may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council. A delegated act shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of 2 months and that period shall be extended by 2 months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on revenue – the effect is as follows: the amount budgeted for the year 2011: EUR 16 653 700 000. Own resources (customs duties) will increase by EUR 381.60 million for each year from 2014 to 2016 inclusive. The reason is that if a country is removed from a list of beneficiaries, it will export to the EU under a different trade regime which is either less favourable or at best equal to the regime offered by the Regulation, resulting in more customs duties being collected on behalf of the EU. The calculation of impact on the EU budget takes the situation created by Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 as the status quo (duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market, no duties paid). Then, for each country concerned, it compares the status quo to duties paid under an alternative trade regime each country will enjoy once removed from the list of beneficiaries, which is as follows: for least-developed countries (LDCs): the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme, offering duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market (no duties paid); for upper-middle-income countries (UMICs): the most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment (duties paid as per general EU tariff schedule); for other developing countries (DCs): the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that suspends or reduces tariffs (some duties paid, some at a reduced rate). The final impact on the EU budget will depend on the number of countries removed from the list of beneficiaries. The amendment proposes to remove 18 countries from Annex I, of which 9 would not benefit from the EBA scheme and therefore their exports to the EU would be subject to a duty. However, if they fulfill certain conditions before the amendment takes effect on 1 January 2014, they will continue to benefit from current trade preferences. In this respect, the figure given is a maximum, as it assumes all 9 concerned countries will be removed: in fact, if a country continues to benefit from the Regulation, the customs duties will not accrue to the EU budget and the figure will be lower."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. CONTENT: the Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/352 which establishes a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports. It is proposed that the new transitional provision shall provide Member States with the option to allow managing bodies of a port or competent authorities to decide whether to:  waive (condone, i.e. not require the payment at all); or suspend (freeze or put on hold the payment for a certain time period); or reduce (decrease the payment); or defer (require the payment at a later point in time) the payment of the port infrastructure charges. As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. This new provision also stipulates that the managing body of a port or the competent authority shall ensure that port users and the representatives or associations of port users are informed accordingly. The time limit of two months referred to in Regulation (EU) 2017/352 shall not apply."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the European Union has already approved the Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol and the four previous amendments to the Protocol. At the 28th meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, which took place in Kigali, Rwanda, from 10th to 15th October 2016, the text of an amendment to that Protocol (the Kigali amendment) was adopted, adding a stepwise reduction of the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) to the control measures of the Montreal Protocol. A stepwise reduction of the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons is necessary to reduce the contribution of those substances to climate change and to prevent their unlimited introduction, in particular in developing countries. CONTENT: the proposal concerns the adoption by the Council of a decision on the conclusion of the agreement to amend the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, adopted in Kigali on 15 October 2016. The text of the Kigali amendment divides countries into three groups based on when they should reduce the use of HFCs: the first group, which includes the most economically developed countries, must implement the first reductions in HFCs during the period 2019-2023 and undertake to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% by 2036, compared to the period 2011-2013 as a reference; a second group of countries will freeze its HFC consumption and production between 2024 and 2028 and commit to reducing its consumption by 80% by 2045; the remaining countries will freeze their consumption and production by 2028 and 2031. Together, countries will have to reduce HFC levels by 85% by 2047. The Kigali Amendment will enter into force on 1 January 2019, provided that at least 20 parties have deposited their instruments of ratification. The envisaged phase-down of HFCs is implemented through Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 that will have to be revised at a later stage in order to ensure compliance with the Kigali Amendment beyond 2030. Until 2030, the last year for which the Regulation determines a reduction step, the phase-down schedule is stricter than the future control measures under the Montreal Protocol."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union and its Member States are Parties to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention). Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Aarhus Regulation) established provisions to apply the provisions of the Convention to EU institutions and bodies. For the European Green Deal to be successful and bring about lasting change, the public - individuals but also civil society - should remain a driving force in the transition and be given the means to participate actively in the development and implementation of new policies. In its Communication on the European Green Deal, the Commission committed itself to revise the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ to improve access to administrative and judicial review at EU level for citizens and NGOs who have concerns about the legality of decisions affecting the environment and to take measures to improve their access to justice before the national courts in all Member States. In its resolution of 15 January 2020, the European Parliament reaffirmed that it is essential to ensure that EU citizens have genuine access to justice and documents as enshrined in the Aarhus Convention. CONTENT: the proposal aims to revise the administrative review created established in 2006 by the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ for the benefit of NGOs with regard to acts and omissions of an administrative nature by EU institutions and bodies. In concrete terms, the amending proposal: - extends the current possibilities for NGOs to request administrative review: whereas administrative review can currently only be requested for acts of 'individual scope' (which directly concern a person), in future NGOs may also request review of any non-legislative administrative act of 'general scope'; however, the proposal excludes provisions of such acts for which EU law explicitly requires implementing measures at EU or national level; - amends the references to environmental law by providing that, in future, any administrative act which contravenes EU environmental law may be subject to review, irrespective of its policy objectives; however, the proposal does not envisage granting standing for individuals; - extends the deadlines for the internal review procedure to allow for an appropriate quality of submissions, including a two-week extension for NGOs and a four-week extension for EU institutions. Budgetary implications The report and the external study on the functioning of access to justice in environmental matters accompanying the proposal assessed the impact of the different options on the internal resources of the EU institutions, in particular the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). They concluded that this impact shall be limited if the options introduced by the proposal are followed. The proposed amendments shall not create a new system and shall not lead to an increase in the number of potential applicants for review. Although the expanding of the eligibility requirements may lead to an increase in the current workload, this could be partially compensated by clearer eligibility criteria."

The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, exercising its prerogatives as an association committee in accordance with Rule 50 of the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, was also consulted for an opinion on the report. The committee recommended that Parliament’s position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows: A sustainable industry policy strategy in the Union : the committee stressed the need to exclude unfair tenders comprising goods and/or services originating outside the Union. At the same time, reciprocity and fair conditions for the market access of Union industries should be ensured. Keep the principle of uniformity of the Common Commercial Policy (CCP): to prevent distortion of the internal market, and ensure efficient leverage through the CCP, Members stated that that Member States or their contracting authorities may restrict the access of third country goods and services to their tendering procedures only by measures provided for in the Regulation or by relevant Union law, and only after an investigation by the Commission has revealed the absence of substantial reciprocity by the third country concerned. Scope: the Regulation shall apply to the award of contracts and to the award of concessions for services provided for governmental purposes. It is proposed to exclude from the scope of the Regulation developing countries considered to be vulnerable due to a lack of diversification and insufficient integration within the international trading system as well as countries and potential GSP+ beneficiary countries. Rules of origin : the determination of the origin of a service should be made in line with the principles of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The provisions determining the rules of origin of services should prevent the circumvention of restrictions on access to the Union public procurement market through the establishment of ""letterbox"" companies. Procedure : Members wanted to ensure that the term 'calendar days' is consistently used throughout the proposal instead of 'days', 'calendar days' and 'working days'. They also shortened the length of the procedures throughout the proposal to provide faster protection, and made amendments intended to avoid an endless consultation procedure with third countries. Public contracts : in the performance of public contracts economic operators must comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions. A ‘lack of substantial reciprocity’ shall be presumed, where the non-observance of international labour law provisions listed in the Directive on public procurement. Assess impact and review the instrument : the report proposes incorporating a review clause, which obliges the Commission to look into the impact of the regulation, after it has come into force and being applied for a few years. Accordingly, when the Commission submits its second report, it shall also submit a legislative proposal for an amended Regulation or set out the reasons why, in its view, no changes are necessary. For the same reason, the report suggests limiting the application of any restrictive measures taken through an implementing act to up to 5 years so as to avoid these measures turning into a permanent closure of the market."

538EP8,"""""Macro-financial assistance to Ukraine """"",0.657,0.837,0.86,0.042,0.077,0.866,0.801,0.019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to grant macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Ukraine of a maximum amount of EUR 1.8 billion. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in line with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine that goes beyond mere bilateral cooperation, encompassing gradual political association and economic integration. The EU signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Ukraine in 1998 that outlines the framework of cooperation in all key areas of reform and continues to be the legal basis of relations between the two parties. Relations were further reinforced in November 2009 when the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda was adopted, which was updated in 2011 (endorsed by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council in June 2013). On 21 March and 27 June 2014, the EU and Ukraine signed an Association Agreement, which will establish a deep political association and economic integration between the EU and Ukraine. The Ukrainian economy is experiencing a deep recession that is the result of long-standing macroeconomic imbalances and structural problems. The eruption of an armed conflict in the East aggravated the situation through sizable losses of productive capacity and reduced confidence which had a heavy toll on the economy. The new government appointed in Ukraine following the political change in February 2014 envisaged the implementation of an ambitious reform Action Plan. These efforts have been seriously complicated, however, by the armed conflict in the East, growing trade restrictions from Russia, and the escalation of a natural gas dispute between the two countries. As a result, the economic recession in Ukraine has become more severe than initially expected by international donors. In the current situation, Ukraine does not have access to international debt markets and is not expected to regain it in the short term. This is why the Ukrainian authorities requested MFA from the EU of EUR 2 billion on 9 September 2014. The European Commission is submitting to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal to grant MFA to Ukraine of maximum EUR 1.8 billion in the form of medium-term loans . CONTENT: the proposal aims to grant MFA to Ukraine of a maximum amount of EUR 1.8 billion, with a view to supporting Ukraine's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda. The assistance will contribute to cover Ukraine’s residual external financing needs in 2015-16, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance shall be made available for a period of two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding foreseen by the proposal. Conditions for granting the assistance : the Commission and the Ukrainian authorities would agree on a Memorandum of Understanding setting out the structural reform measures associated with the proposed MFA operation, including aspects of timing and sequencing. These measures will support the authorities’ reform agenda, including relevant elements of the aforementioned forthcoming National Reform Strategy for 2015-17, and the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, as well as complementing the programmes agreed with the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral donors. A pre-condition for granting the assistance shall be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms - including a multi-party parliamentary system - and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. Reform strategy : the Commission will seek consensus with the Ukrainian authorities on the expected National Reform Strategy, so as to facilitate smooth implementation also of the conditionality to be agreed in the proposed Memorandum of Understanding. These policy conditions should address some of the fundamental weaknesses accumulated over the years by the Ukrainian economy. Possible areas of conditionality could in principle include: · public finance management; · anti-corruption; · tax administration; · reforms in the energy sector; · financial sector reforms; · and measures to improve the business environment. Aid instalments : t he assistance will be disbursed in three loan instalments : the 1st instalment is expected to take place in the middle of 2015 ; the 2nd instalment could be disbursed in the 4th quarter of 2015 ; the 3 rd and last instalment could be made available towards the end of the 1st quarter of 2016. The disbursements would inter alia be conditional on satisfactory reviews under the IMF programme and the continued drawing by Ukraine on IMF funds. Management of the assistance : the assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. Where the circumstances permit, and if Ukraine so requests, the Commission may: · take the steps necessary to ensure that an early repayment clause is included in the loan terms and conditions and the inclusion of a corresponding clause in the conditions of the borrowing operations; · decide to refinance all or part of its initial borrowings or may restructure the corresponding financial conditions. Implementing powers : implementing powers shall be conferred on the Commission in line with (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council . The fact that the assistance is of a substantial amount and therefore has a potentially significant impact, justifies the use of the examination procedure, in this context. Report : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, examining the progress made in implementing the Union's macro-financial assistance, the economic situation and prospects of Ukraine, as well as progress made in implementing the policy measures, indicating the connection between the economic policy conditions laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding, Ukraine’s on-going economic and fiscal performance and the Commission’s decisions to release the instalments of the Union's macro-financial assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the MFA would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed into the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU from budget line 01 03 06 (“Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund”). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2015 for a total amount of EUR 1,200 million and the third loan disbursement in 2016 for the amount of EUR 600 million, the provisioning will take place in the budgets for 2017 (for EUR 108 million) and 2018 (EUR 54 million)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea provides for financing in the following areas: international relations, governance, data collection and scientific advice and control and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy. In each field of action, Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 is completed by other regulations or decisions. Several elements of the related legislation have evolved since the adoption of Regulation 861/2006 which should be amended in order to ensure coherence between all the elements of the legislative framework. Experience has demonstrated the need to amend the Regulation in order to slightly adapt some provisions to better fit the needs. It is also proposed to clarify when necessary the scope of the measures financed and to improve the drafting of some articles. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: this revision does not entail any fundamental changes to Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006: the objectives, the type of measures financed, the architecture and the financial envelope are not affected. Modifications due to the evolution of the legislative framework : the scope of the new data collection framework is larger than the previous framework. It covers not only the collection of data by Member States but also its management and use; take into consideration the fact that in Council Decision 2007/409/EC the Regional Advisory Councils have been granted the status of bodies pursuing an aim of general European interest. They can be granted financial support to cover their operating costs and the restriction which limited support to their start up phase has been deleted; Article 5 has been modified to mirror the provisions of the new data collection framework, under which the data to be collected also comprises socio-economic variables in the fisheries, aquaculture and processing sector, such as income, capital costs, employment, etc; reformulate and simplify Article 9 on the collection, management and use of data in order to align the description with the other areas of expenditure covered by the Regulation, by identifying only the main categories of measures. The eligible measures are defined in detail by Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 concerning the establishment of a Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the Common Fisheries Policy; take account of the relevant provisions of the new data collection framework which define in detail the programming procedures; delete Article 23 as it has become obsolete since the programming procedures are now defined in the new data collection framework. Responding to the needs : amendments aim to: allow the Commission to sign procurement contracts with the international bodies in charge of stock assessments; extend the possibility of financing the costs related to the preparation of Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA) meetings to other representative organisations in ACFA. This amendment shall allow for financial support for translation, interpretation and room hire costs related to these meetings; advance the date for the submission of applications for Community support. This is designed to accelerate procedures and programme implementation; give a more detailed description of the information to be provided in order to standardise the data received on the projects and to reinforce sound financial management. It also specifies information required for joint projects conducted by more than one Member State; provide information on the mechanisms which will allow verification on the use of the co financed control resources; improve the transmission of data on the projects. Clarification of the scope of the actions to be undertaken : a number of provisions of Decision 2000/439/EC on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy were not taken over in Regulation (EC) 861/2006 and were also not converted into implementing rules. This created a legal void for the years 2007 and 2008 in which the Commission had to apply the rules previously in force as laid down in Decision 2000/439/EC. In the interest of legal certainty it should be retroactively provided that those rules continued to be applicable in that period. Other proposed amendments aim to: clarify that the partnerships in the international field may be at bilateral, regional or multilateral level; replace the words ""civil servants"" with ""personnel"" to cater for the fact that training participants, although representing a Member State authority, are not necessarily civil servants; replace the words ""irresponsible and illegal fishing"" with ""illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing"", which is the used notably in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008; better reflect the tasks carried out by the Joint Research Centre, which not only analyses the implementation of control activities, but also gives advice and is involved in developing new technologies; delete a superfluous category of expenditure for the Community Fisheries Control Agency; update the list of consultative bodies for the meetings of which the ACFA plenary designates a representative; reflect the range of cooperation which the Commission may need to establish with international organisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the modifications introduced by this amending proposal do not entail financial consequences on the EU budget. They will simply allow better execution of the budget amounts as quantified in the Financial Statement attached to Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by Decision 2012/419/EU, the European Council amended the status of Mayotte with regard to the Union with effect from 1 January 2014. Therefore, from that date Mayotte will cease to be an overseas territory to become an outermost region within the meaning of Articles 349 and 355(1) TFEU. Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014. This proposal follows the examination of requests made by the French authorities to have the Union acquis amended through derogations and/or transitional periods applicable to Mayotte in different areas, such as environment, agriculture, social policy and public health. The examination has revealed that France needs additional time to comply with the Union acquis with regard to Mayotte in these fields. The amendments proposed relate to all the Directives. In the interest of simplicity and speediness, it has been considered expedient not to resort to individual proposals for each of the acts concerned but, where legally possible, to bundle the amendments to several acts in a single proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2), Article 114, Article 153(2), Article168 and Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: taking into account the specific situation in Mayotte, the Commission is proposing to amend a series of Directives in the fields of the environment, agriculture, social policy and public health. Environment: it is proposed to amend three Directive in order to: (i) grant France the sufficient periods of time for meeting the requirements of the Directives concerning urban waste water treatment and for the adoption and the proper implementation of river basin management plans; (ii) define specific time limits to allow France to reach the Union standards as regards bathing water quality. Agriculture: it is proposed to amend Council Directive 1999/74/EC laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens. Since laying hens are reared in Mayotte in unenriched cages and since it would be difficult to change this position in the short term, France should be granted sufficient time to adapt. Social policy: it is proposed to amend Directive 2006/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with a view to granting a derogation to France, until 31 December 2017, from certain provisions in the field of artificial optical radiation. It is also proposed that France must ensure proper consultation of the social partners and limit risks for workers to a minimum. Public health: it is proposed to amend Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, to grant France an additional period of 30 months from 1 January 2014 to bring into force the provisions necessary to comply with that Directive in respect of Mayotte . BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a shift from the use of fossil fuels in vehicles to electromobility is one of the prerequisites for reaching the climate neutrality goal in 2050. Batteries are thus an important source of energy and one of the key enablers for sustainable development, green mobility, clean energy and climate neutrality. The current regulatory framework, with Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries, only covers the end-of-life stage of batteries. There are currently no legal provisions in the EU that cover other aspects of the production and use phases of batteries, such as electrochemical performance and durability, GHG emissions, or responsible sourcing. According to estimates from the World Economic Forum, there is a need to scale up global battery production by a factor of 19 to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Commission is therefore proposing to modernise EU legislation on batteries, implementing its first initiative among the measures announced in the new action plan for the circular economy. In addition to the Commission’s work, both the Council and the Parliament have called for action to support the transition to electro-mobility, carbon-neutral energy storage, and a sustainable battery value chain. CONTENT: this proposal introduces gradual requirements to minimise the carbon footprint throughout the life cycle of batteries. Its objective is three-fold: 1) to strengthen the functioning of the internal market (including products, processes, battery waste and recycled materials) by ensuring a level playing field through a common set of rules; 2) to promote a circular economy; and 3) reduce environmental and social impacts throughout all the stages of the battery life cycle Minimum sustainability requirements In order to encourage the production and placing on the EU market of high quality and efficient batteries, the proposed Regulation establishes requirements on sustainability, safety and labelling to allow the placing on the market and putting into service of batteries, as well as requirements for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries. The Regulation would apply to all types of batteries, i.e. portable batteries, automotive batteries, electric vehicle batteries and industrial batteries. The proposal also sets out requirements to ensure the proper functioning of the market for secondary raw materials while preventing and reducing the environmental impacts of the production and use of batteries, as well as their treatment (including recycling) at the end of the battery's life. Carbon footprint of electric vehicle batteries and rechargeable industrial batteries The proposal provides for the following: - as of 1 July 2024, only industrial rechargeable batteries and electric vehicle batteries for which a carbon footprint statement has been drawn up could be placed on the market; - as of 1 January 2026, batteries should be classified into carbon footprint performance classes; - as of 1 July 2027, batteries should comply with maximum life-cycle carbon footprint thresholds; - as of 1 January 2030, industrial and electric-vehicle batteries with internal storage should contain the following minimum share of recovered cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel from waste of the cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel present in active materials in those batteries: 12% cobalt; 85% lead, 4% lithium and 4% nickel; - as of 1 January 2035, the minimum share of recovered cobalt, lithium or nickel should increase to 20% cobalt, 10% lithium and 12% nickel. For lead the minimum share shall stay at 85%. Increasing the resilience of the EU battery supply chain by closing the materials loop To close the loop and keep recovered materials used in batteries in the European economy for as long as possible, the Commission proposes to set new requirements and targets for the recycled content and the collection, treatment and recycling of batteries at the end of their life cycle. The proposal sets collection rates for waste portable batteries to be achieved by Member States, excluding currently waste batteries from light means of transport. The collection rates should gradually increase so to ensure that by end 2025 65% of waste portable batteries are collected and by end 2030 70% of such batteries are collected. The proposal also contains requirements for re-purposing and remanufacturing operations to give a second life to industrial and electric vehicle batteries. Persons carrying out the repurposing or remanufacturing of batteries should ensure that the examination, performance testing, packing and shipment of batteries and their components is carried out following adequate quality control and safety instructions. Battery passports By 1 January 2026 at the latest, a ‘passport’ should be created for batteries, with a view to enabling economic operators to collect and re-use information and data on each battery placed on the market more efficiently and to make better informed choices in their planning activities. Budgetary implications The proposal requires human and financial resources for the purchase of data and services. Some of the staff requirements are expected to be met under the existing allocations of the Commission, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)."
4072EP9,"""""Common agricultural policy: financing, management and monitoring""""",0.806,0.923,0.0,0.534,0.439,0.565,0.591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to modernise and simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 (horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. More specifically: (i) agricultural prices have fallen sharply as a result of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions; (ii) the EU has become more open to global markets; (iii) the EU has made new commitments at international level, for example on climate change mitigation (through COP 21). On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a regulation defining the objectives of the CAP as well as rules on support for strategic plans to be developed by Member States in the framework of the CAP; a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. CONTENT: this proposal for a horizontal regulation of the CAP seeks to maintain the current structure of the CAP in two pillars with annual measures of general application in Pillar I (direct payments) complemented by measures reflecting the national and regional specificities under a multi-annual programming approach in Pillar II (rural development). The financing of the various CAP interventions and measures from the Union budget is provided by (i) the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and (ii) the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Increased subsidiarity for Member States : the new design of the CAP for post 2020 will point to an increased subsidiarity so that Member States can better tailor implementing measures under both Pillars to their realities and farmers' concrete circumstances. On this basis, the current CAP Horizontal Regulation is adapted to the new delivery model and reflects more flexibility for Member States in implementing the policy (in line with their local needs), less bureaucracy for beneficiaries and shift to a performance-based policy. Setting targets at EU level : the move at EU level from an emphasis on compliance to performance requires a clear identification of the objectives which the policy has to achieve: again, these objectives shall be established at EU level. In order to advance towards a more result-driven policy mechanism, there shall be a shift from assurance on legality and regularity of the underlying transactions to assurance on performance and the respect of EU basic requirements, like (IACS) or the governance bodies (paying agencies, coordinating bodies, competent authorities and certification bodies). The robust and reliable governance structures which characterise the CAP will be maintained. Controls and sanctions : in addition to financing provisions, the CAP Horizontal Regulation continues to have provisions on general principles for checks and penalties, checks for conditionality and the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS). A new system of ‘conditionality’ shall link all farmers' income support (and other area- and animal-based payments) to the application of environment- and climate-friendly farming practices. Accordingly, the proposed Regulation lays down rules on financing, management and control systems, clearance processes (annual financial clearance and annual performance clearance) and conformity procedure. Simplification : in line with the new delivery model, an annual performance clearance shall be established in order to check the eligibility of the expenditure in relation to the reported outputs. The proposal also provides for a reduction in the number of paying agencies and strengthens the role of the coordinating body and the certification body. It introduces the concept of the single audit approach and provides that the number of audits carried out by the Commission can be reduced. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy. Agricultural reserve : a new agricultural reserve shall be established in the EAGF, to provide additional support for the agricultural sector for the purpose of safety-net measures in the context of market management or stabilisation and/or in case of crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution. The amount of the reserve shall be at least EUR 400 million at the beginning of each financial year. Non-committed appropriations of the agricultural reserve shall be carried over without time limitation to finance the agricultural reserve in the following financial years. Transfer of allocations : Member States shall have the possibility to transfer up to 15% of their CAP allocations between direct payments and rural development and vice versa, to ensure the financing of their priorities and measures."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol. As a reminder, the Eurodac Regulation (recast) (Regulation (EU) No 603/2013) enables law enforcement authorities to consult Eurodac in order to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. Since 2001, the Agreement between the European Community and Iceland and Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway also covers the application of the ‘Dublin-related’ parts of Eurodac. However, law enforcement access, which was a new element of the ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation compared to the original Eurodac regime (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) has not been regulated so far by the said Agreement. The negotiations on an agreement between the European Union, on the one part, and Iceland and Norway, on the other part, on the modalities of the participation by Iceland and Norway to the procedure for comparison and data transmission for law enforcement purposes foreseen in chapter VI of the ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation have been finalised and an Agreement in the form of a Protocol to the Agreement of 19 January 2001, extending the application of the Agreement of 19 January 2001 to law enforcement was initialled. The extension of the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to Iceland and Norway would: - enable the law enforcement authorities of Iceland and Norway to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data entered by other participating States and stored in the Eurodac database when they seek to establish the identity or get further information concerning a person who is suspected of a serious crime or terrorism or concerning a victim; - the law enforcement authorities of all other participating States, whether other EU Member States or Associates Countries, to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data entered by Iceland and Norway and stored in the Eurodac database, for the same purposes."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: although they are not protected as a classical intellectual property rights (IPR), trade secrets are nevertheless a key complementary instrument for the appropriation of intellectual assets that are the drivers of the knowledge economy of the 21st century. Economists agree that companies, irrespective of their size, value trade secrets at least as much as all other forms of IP. Trade secrets are particularly important for SMEs and start-ups as these often lack specialised human resources and financial strength to manage and defend IPRs. Due to globalisation, the exposure of trade secrets to theft, espionage or other misappropriation techniques continues to increase. A survey launched in 2012 revealed that, over the last 10 years, about one in five respondents had suffered at least one attempt at misappropriation within the EU. The risk also increases that stolen trade secrets are used in third countries to produce sub-standard goods that subsequently compete within the EU with those of the victim of the misappropriation. Member States legislation offer an uneven level of protection of trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition, thus leading to fragmentation of the internal market of information and know-how. The Commission considers that harmonisation of trade secret law in the EU would improve conditions for firms to develop, exchange and use innovative knowledge. The Commission adopted in May 2011 a comprehensive IP strategy, undertaking to examine the protection of trade secrets. This proposal is a product of the commitment to create a single market for intellectual property. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option favoured by the Commission to strengthen the efficacy of legal protection for trade secrets involves convergence of national civil law remedies against the misappropriation of trade secrets and rules on preservation of confidentiality of trade secrets during and after legal proceedings. The convergence of civil law remedies would allow innovative businesses to defend their rightful trade secrets more effectively across the EU. CONTENT: the draft directive establishes a definition of trade secret and sets out the means for victims of the misappropriation of such a secret to obtain reparation. The definition of ‘trade secret’ contains three elements: (i) the information must be confidential; (ii) it should have commercial value because of its confidentiality; and (iii) the trade secret holder should have made reasonable efforts to keep it confidential. This definition follows the definition of ‘undisclosed information’ in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The key element for the acquisition, use and disclosure of a trade secret to be unlawful is the absence of consent of the trade secret holder. The use of a trade secret by a third party is also unlawful, from the moment that third party was aware, should have been aware, or was given notice, of the original unlawful act. Measures, procedures and remedies : the proposal establishes the measures, procedures and remedies that should be made available to the holder of a trade secret in case of unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of that trade secret by a third party. Specifically, the proposal: ·  sets the general principles applicable to the civil enforcement instruments in order to prevent and repress acts of trade secret misappropriation, and safeguards to prevent abusive litigation; ·  establishes a limitation period of at least one year but not more than two years to bring actions for the application of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in the Directive; ·  requires that Member States provide judicial authorities with mechanisms to preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets disclosed in court for the purpose of litigation, such as restricting access to documents submitted by the parties or third parties. The confidentiality measures must apply during litigation, but also after litigation in case of requests of public access to documents for as long as the information in question remains a trade secret; ·  provides for provisional and precautionary measures in the form of interlocutory injunctions or precautionary seizure of infringing goods; ·  establishes safeguards to ensure equity and proportionality of the provisional and precautionary measures. The proposal also sets out the measures that may be ordered with the decision on the merits of the case: ·  prohibition of use or disclosure of the trade secret, the prohibition to make, offer, place on the market or use infringing goods (or import or store infringing goods for those purposes) and corrective measures; ·  awarding of damages for the prejudice suffered by the trade secret holder and the possibility of calculating the damages on the basis of hypothetical royalties; ·  empowering the competent judicial authorities to adopt publicity measures at the request of the plaintiff, including the publication of the decision on the merits of the case – provided that the trade secret is not disclosed. Sanctions, reporting and final provisions : in order to ensure an effective application of the Directive the proposal provides for the application of sanctions in case of non-compliance with the measures provided for and includes provisions on monitoring and reporting."

BACKGROUND: the European Union is built on solidarity, a shared value which is strongly felt throughout European society. There are many young people who want to engage in solidarity activities, and there are many unmet needs in communities that could be addressed by involving young people in such activities. The State of the Union address of 14 September 2016 emphasised the need to invest in young people and announced the establishment of a European Solidarity Corps with a view to creating opportunities for young people across the Union to make a meaningful contribution to society, show solidarity and develop their skills. In its communication of 7 December 2016, the Commission launched the first phase of the Corps and reiterated the target of having 100 000 young Europeans taking part in it by 2020. During this initial phase, eight different EU programmes were mobilised to offer volunteering, traineeship or job opportunities to young people across the EU. As there is potential to further develop solidarity with victims of crises and disasters in non-EU countries, this proposal provides for extending the scope of the European Solidarity Corps to include support to humanitarian aid operations in non-EU countries, including those located in the EU outermost regions' neighbourhood. The new programme shall allow at least 350 000 young Europeans to support communities in need between 2021 and 2027 through volunteering, traineeships and job placements. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European solidarity corps under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. The regulation on the European solidarity corps shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2021. The European solidarity corps aims to strengthen the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high-quality solidarity activities. It is a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity and democracy in Europe and abroad and to address societal and humanitarian challenges on the ground, with a particular focus on promoting social inclusion. It shall enable participants to strengthen and validate their skills and facilitate their integration into the labour market. The programme shall offer activities that can be undertaken in a country other than the country of residence of the participants (cross-border activities and volunteering in support of humanitarian aid) and activities that can be undertaken in their country of residence (in-country). The programme shall be implemented under two strands of action: Strand 1: participation of young people in solidarity activities addressing societal challenges : the actions shall contribute in particular to strengthening cohesion, solidarity and democracy in the EU and beyond, while addressing societal challenges, with particular efforts to promote social inclusion; Strand 2: participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities (European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps) : these actions shall contribute in particular to providing needs-based humanitarian aid, aimed at preserving lives, preventing and alleviating human suffering and maintaining human dignity, as well as strengthening the capacities and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-stricken communities. Supported actions : the European solidarity corps shall provide young people with easily accessible opportunities to engage in volunteering, traineeships or jobs in solidarity-related sectors, such as the social economy, and to devise and develop solidarity projects at their own initiative. It shall also support networking activities for its participants and organisations. Participation : the European solidarity corps targets young people aged 18-30, and participation in the activities offered by the European solidarity corps shall require prior registration in the European solidarity corps portal. Any public or private entity established in a participating country as well as international organisations may apply for funding under the European solidarity corps. A quality label shall be obtained by the participating organisation as a pre-condition for receiving funding under the European solidarity corps. Special attention shall be given to ensuring that the activities supported by the European solidarity corps are accessible to all young people, notably the most disadvantaged ones. Special measures shall be put in place to promote social inclusion, the participation of disadvantaged young people, as well as to take into account the constraints imposed by the remoteness of a number of rural areas and of the outermost regions of the Union and the Overseas Countries and Territories. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission’s proposal for the multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 1.26 billion at current prices for the period 2021-2027."
10095EP8,"""""Adapting to development in the road transport sector""""",0.157,0.371,0.9,0.688,0.077,0.761,0.586,0.635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve the single market in road transport through amendments intended to eliminate causes for disparities and to ensure better enforcement of the rules. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (‘light commercial vehicles’): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
5462EP8,"""""Binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement""""",0.529,0.751,0.9,0.333,0.135,0.91,0.89,0.615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to achieve a reduction at EU level of 30% in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030 compared to 2005, in all sectors that are not part of the Emission Trading System (non-ETS sectors) in order to implement EU commitments under the Paris agreement. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : the Commission considers that with current policies, GHG emissions are not expected to sufficiently decrease to reach the European Union's target of at least 40% reductions on 1990 by 2030 and, more specifically, a 30% GHG reduction in non-ETS sectors compared to 2005. Under current trends and with full implementation of existing legally binding targets and policies, emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Decision ('ESD') are only projected to decrease by around 24% below 2005 levels in 2030. Hence, national reduction targets, which provide the incentive for further policies driving deeper reductions, are required. The proposal is an important element of the strategic framework for the Energy Union. It aims to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (December 2015), which includes a long-term goal to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to below 1.5°C. The EU's climate objective is to reduce GHG emissions by 80-95% in 2050 compared to 1990, in the context of necessary reductions by developed countries as a group. In order to achieve the European Union's domestic long-term objective to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, continued progress is needed for a transition to a low-carbon economy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment considered options for implementing the reduction in the non-ETS sectors other than the LULUCF sectors, building upon the current ESD and the guidance given by the European Council. The impact assessment looks at what the impact of the proposal would be on fairness, cost efficiency, and environmental integrity. CONTENT : the proposal lays down the minimum contributions of Member States to emission reductions for the period from 2021 to 2030 and the rules for determining the annual emissions allocations and those on evaluation on progress. The reductions aim to promote improvements, particularly in the sectors building, agriculture, waste management and transport. Annual emission levels for the period from 2021 to 2030: the proposal lays down Member States’ emission limits in 2030 as set in Annex I, and the rules on how emission levels are determined for 2021-2030: all Member States will have national emission targets for 2030 expressed as a percentage reduction from 2005 emission levels as well as access to new flexibilities to achieve those targets cost effectively. Collectively, these national targets give an overall EU reduction of 30% in the sectors covered by the proposal. The 2030 targets range from 0% to -40% compared to 2005 levels; the annual emission levels are determined based on a linear trajectory starting with average emissions for 2016-2018 based on the most recent reviewed GHG emission data. Annual emissions allocations (AEAs) in CO2 equivalent for each Member State for each year of the period will be set out in an implementing act ; different capacities of Member States to take action are recognised by differentiating targets according to GDP per capita across Member States. Flexibility instruments to achieve annual limits : the proposal sets out the flexibility available to Member States to achieve their annual limits including flexibility over time through banking and borrowing of annual emissions allocations (AEAs) within the commitment period, and flexibility between Member States through transfers of AEAs. In particular, two new flexibilities are introduced, which will allow Member States to reach their targets cost efficiently. One-off flexibility for certain Member States to access allowances from the EU Emissions Trading System : the new flexibility allows eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions in the non-Emission Trading System sectors with EU Emission Trading System allowances which would normally have been auctioned, generating revenue for that Member State; Flexibility to access credits from the land use sector (LULUCF): the proposal permits up to 280 million tonnes of CO2 to be credited from certain land categories to be used for national targets over the entire period from 2021-2030. The flexibility applies only to net credits generated at national level by deforested land, afforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland. Corrective action : if, based on the annual evaluation performed by the Commission, a Member State's progress deviates from its annual emission allocation, that Member State will need to prepare an action plan with additional measures to be implemented in order to ensure that it will comply with its obligations. Compliance check : the compliance check on GHG emissions from each Member State will take place every five years, and no longer annually, for each of the previous years of the period. Should a Member State be found to be non-compliant with its annual emissions allocations for any year of the period, corrective action in the form of the addition to the next year's emissions of a quantity equal to the amount in tonnes of CO2 equivalents of the excess emissions multiplied by a factor of 1.08 will apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited implications for the EU budget (EUR 3346 for the period 2017-2020). The indirect impacts on Member States’ budgets will depend on their choice of national policies and measures for GHG emission reductions and other mitigation action in sectors covered by this initiative. The proposal provides for continued annual reporting but with less frequent compliance checks. This will reduce the administrative costs for Member States. DELEGATED ACTS : the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
2292EP7,"""""EU-Australia agreement on the processing and transfer of PNR data""""",0.667,0.747,0.0,0.387,0.182,0.747,0.723,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to conclude an Agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: Australian legislation empowers the Australian Customs Service to require each air carrier operating passenger flight to and from Australia to provide it with electronic access to Passenger Name Record (PNR) data prior to the passenger arriving or leaving Australia. The requirements of the Australian authorities are based on the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Administration Act 1985, the Migration Act 1958, the Crimes Act 1914, the Privacy Act 1988 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982. This legislation aims at obtaining PNR data electronically in advance of a flight's arrival and therefore significantly enhances the Australian Customs Service’s ability to conduct efficient and effective advance risk assessment of passenger and to facilitate bona fide travel, thereby enhancing the security of Australia. The European Union in cooperating with Australia in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime views the transfer of data to Australia as fostering international police and judicial cooperation which will be achieved though the transfer of analytical information flowing from PNR data by Australia to the competent Member States authorities as well as Europol and Eurojust within their respective competences. The European Union signed an agreement in 2008 with Australia on the transfer and processing of PNR data based on a set of commitments by the Australian Customs Service in relation to the application of its PNR programme. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and pending the conclusion of the agreement, the Council sent the 2008 Australia Agreement to the European Parliament for its consent for the conclusion. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it decided to postpone its vote on the requested consent and requesting a renegotiation of the Agreement on the basis of certain criteria (see RSP/2010/2657 ). Pending such renegotiation, the 2008 Agreement would remain provisionally applicable. On 23 September 2010, the Council received three recommendations from the Commission to authorise the opening of negotiations for an Agreement between the European Union and Australia for the transfer and use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational crime. On 11 November 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Recommendation from the Commission to the Council to authorise the opening of the negotiations. On 2 December 2010, the Council adopted a Decision, together with a negotiation directive, authorising the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the European Union. It is now proposed to conclude the Agreement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a), in conjunction with Article 218 (6)(a) of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal aims to conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. PNR and basic principles of the Agreement : to recall, PNR is a record of each passenger' travel requirements which contains all information necessary to enable reservations to be processed and controlled by air carriers.Air carriers are under an obligation to provide the Australian Customs Service with access to certain PNR data to the extent it is collected and contained in the air carrier's automated reservation and departure control systems. However, the data protection laws of the EU do not allow European and other carriers operating flight from the EU to transmit the PNR data of their passengers to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data without adducing appropriate safeguards. Accordingly, a solution is required that will provide the legal basis for the transfer of PNR data from the EU to Australia as a recognition of the necessity and importance of the use of PNR data in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime, whilst avoiding legal uncertainty for air carriers. In addition, this solution should be applied homogenously throughout the European Union in order to ensure a legal certainty for air carriers and respect of individuals' rights to the protection of personal data as well as their physical security. Safeguards: the Agreement has secured several important safeguards for those whose data will be transferred and processed. In particular, the purpose of processing of PNR data is strictly limited to preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious transnational crime. Individuals are provided with the right to access, correction, redress and information. The data will be transferred using exclusively the 'push' method and the use of sensitive data is prohibited. Retention period: the retention period of the PNR data is limited and the data will be depersonalised after a certain period. Compliance: compliance with these rules shall be subject to independent oversight by the Australian Information Commissioner. Fundamental rights: the Agreement respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, and the right to effective remedy and fair trial. The United Kingdom and Ireland take part in the adoption of the Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council has proved successful in regulating the spirit drinks sector. However, in the light of recent experience and technological innovation it is necessary to update the rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks and to review the ways geographical indications for spirit drinks are registered. In order to align the powers conferred upon the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 to Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, further amendments to that Regulation are needed. CONTENT: the aim of this Commission proposal is to replace Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 and bring it into line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). More specifically, the proposal: divides the provisions adopted by the Commission under that Regulation into delegated acts and implementing acts; contains minor technical adjustments of EU legislation on spirit drinks and it replaces the existing procedures for the management of geographical indications in the spirit drinks sector, with new procedures modelled on the more exhaustive and well tested procedures for agricultural products and foodstuffs laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. It has not been proposed to change the existing EU legal framework for spirit drinks enables the free circulation of goods in the single market by setting up product definitions, labelling rules and provisions related to the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks. Therefore, the purpose and scope of the existing regulation will remain unchanged. This Regulation lays down rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, as well as on the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks. It shall also apply to the use of ethyl alcohol or distillates of agricultural origin in the production of alcoholic beverages and to the use of spirit drinks’ names in the presentation and labelling of other foodstuffs. It shall apply to the products placed on the Union market whether produced in the Union or in third countries, as well as to those produced in the Union for export. Given the importance and complexity of the spirit drinks sector, it is appropriate to keep the spirit drinks Regulation for specific measures on the description and presentation of spirit drinks which go beyond the general rules provided in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, while remaining consistent with those general rules. Lastly, some of the elements currently included in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 716/2013 that concern definitions and rules related to compound terms and allusions, are considered essential and have therefore been introduced in the proposal as part of the basic act. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: to support cooperation between the national public administrations responsible for the application of Union law, the European Commission has developed the Internal Market Information System (IMI) which is a generic, customisable administrative cooperation platform. Freely available for use by the Member States since 2008, this system provides more than 6 000 registered authorities in the 27 Member States and three EEA countries with a fast and secure communication channel for cross-border information exchange with their counterparts, effectively overcoming barriers due to different languages and administrative structures. IMI is currently used for the exchange of information pursuant to Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications  and Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market. Cross-border administrative cooperation frequently involves processing and exchanging personal data of EU citizens. From a legal point of view, IMI operates on the basis of a Commission decision, a ‘comitology’ decision, and a Commission recommendation. The lack of a single legal instrument adopted by the European Parliament and the Council underlying its operations came to be seen as an obstacle to further expansion of IMI. According to the Commission Communication “Towards a Single Market Act”, extending IMI to other sectors ‘with a view to creating a genuine face-to-face electronic network for European administrations’ is one of the keys to promoting better governance of the single market. The Commission’s communication on expanding and developing the IMI’ (the IMI Strategy Communication) adopted on 21 February 2011 set out plans for future expansion of IMI to other areas of EU law. The Commission Communication “A Single Market Act” stressed the importance of IMI for strengthening cooperation among the actors involved, including at local level, thus contributing to better governance of the single market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal consolidates the current rules governing IMI within a single horizontal legally binding instrument. Consequently, no alternative policy options need to be considered at this stage. For this reason, no impact analysis was undertaken. Any subsequent decisions concerning the expansion of the use of IMI beyond the areas of Union law for which it is currently used will require proportionate impact assessments. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal aims at improving the conditions for the functioning of the internal market by providing an effective and user-friendly tool facilitating the practical implementation of provisions of Union law mandating administrative cooperation and information exchange. The proposal for a Regulation: sets down rules for the use of the IMI system for administrative cooperation. These rules include the obligation to appoint one national IMI coordinator per Member State, the obligation on competent authorities to provide an adequate response in a timely manner and the provision that information exchanged via IMI may be used for providing evidence in the same way as similar information obtained within the same Member State; lays down the basic principles for data protection in the IMI , including the rights of data subjects, in a single legal instrument, thus increasing transparency and enhancing legal certainty. The list of areas of Union acts currently supported by IMI is set out in Annex I, while areas of possible future expansion are listed in Annex II. The procedural and budgetary aspects aimed at facilitating future expansion of IMI are in line with the IMI Strategy Communication. BUDGETARY IMPACT: as the use of IMI is mandatory for Member States under the Services Directive and the recently adopted Directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, it is necessary to ensure that IMI can continue to operate on a permanent basis. For this reason, it is proposed that the expenditure related to IMI be regrouped by bringing all costs under the same budget line managed by DG Internal Market and Services (budget line 12.02.01 Implementation and development of the Internal Market). This proposal does not have a budgetary impact over and above what is already foreseen in the years to come in the official programming of the Commission and it is without prejudice to the decisions on the post-2013 multi-annual financial framework. In 2010, the financing of IMI was covered by the following sources: i) ISA programme (EUR 500 000 – budget line 26.03.01.01) and ii) internal market budget lines (EUR 925 000). For 2011-2012, the planned financing from ISA will amount to ca. EUR 1.15 million per year. The impact on operational expenditure is estimated at EUR 1.44 million in commitment appropriations for the year 2013. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions conferring on the Commission the right to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 set up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The Commission presented in October 2013 a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Regulation. The report concluded that the EU export control system provides solid legal and institutional foundations but the system must be upgraded in order to face new challenges. In April 2014, the Commission adopted a communication setting out concrete policy options for the review of the EU export control regime and its adaptation to rapidly changing technological, economic and political circumstances. In 2015, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of the review options outlined in that communication. As part of the impact assessment, the Commission conducted a public consultation, from which it emerged that’s stakeholders generally agreed that a review of current rules would improve the export control system, in particular with regards to its capacity to address evolving security risks such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism and to respond to rapid scientific and technological developments. The export control policy review has been identified as an initiative under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT). Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 has been amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity and readability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: besides the baseline scenario (no policy change), the impacts of four other scenarios were assessed. A combination of the options ""EU system upgrade"" (adjustments to the regulatory framework), and ""EU system modernisation"" (focusing on cyber-surveillance Technologies and human rights) was retained as the preferred solution. CONTENT: the proposal to recast Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 aims to set up a Union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering, technical assistance and transit of dual-use items. The main points are as follows; Control provisions : the proposal: contains amendments to key export control notions: the definition of dual-use items is thus revised to reflect the emergence of new types of dual-use items, such as cyber-surveillance technologies. The proposal also clarifies that controls apply to natural persons, who may be ""exporters"", especially when it comes to technology transfers; clarifies controls on and facilitates intangible technology transfers, as they only become subject to control when the dual-use technology is made available to a person in a third country; clarifies controls applicable to technical assistance involving a cross-border movement; strengthens brokering controls, (i) by extending the definition of the broker to subsidiaries of EU companies outside of the EU, as well as to brokering services supplied by third country nationals from within the EU territory; (ii) by harmonising their application to non-listed items and military end-uses and extending their application to terrorism and human rights violations; harmonises the application of transit controls to non-listed items and military end-uses, and extends controls to the risk of misuse for terrorist acts and human rights violations; puts in place certain controls an anti-circumvention clause to combat trafficking in items of dual usage. EU licensing : the proposal: provides for a definition of authorisations and for common licensing parameters (e.g. validity period) and conditions for use of the EU general authorisations and for global licences; establishes a new authorisation for 'large-projects' for certain large multiannual projects e.g. construction of a nuclear power plant; introduces new general authorisations regarding encryption and low value shipments to facilitate trade while ensuring a sufficient level of security through robust control modalities (e.g. registration, notification and reporting, and auditing); introduces a general authorisation on intra-company transfers of dual-use technology in non-sensitive countries, in particular for research and development purposes, as long as the technology remains under the ownership or control of the parent company. Convergence of catch-all controls : the proposal provides for a clarification and harmonisation of the definition and scope of catch-all controls to ensure their uniform application across the EU. Re-evaluation of intra-EU transfers : the proposal revises the list of items subject to control within the EU in order to focus controls on an updated list of most sensitive items, taking account of technological and commercial developments; Control of exports of cyber-surveillance technologies : the proposal sets out new provisions for an effective control focusing on specific and relevant cyber-surveillance technologies. It introduces an EU autonomous list of specific cyber-surveillance technologies of concern to be subject to controls (monitoring centres and data retention systems), with detailed technical parameters. Enhanced cooperation : the proposal provides for enhanced information exchange between competent authorities and the Commission with a view to support effective and consistent application of controls. It introduces a legal basis regarding the introduction of electronic licensing systems and their interconnection with the Dual-Use Electronic System, and for the setting up of 'technical expert groups' bringing together key industry and government experts into a dialogue on the technical parameters for controls. Transparency and outreach : the proposal sets out transparency measures and expands outreach and information-sharing with operators in order to develop a ""partnership with the private sector"". Dialogue with third countries : the proposal provides a basis for the development of regular dialogues between the EU and key trade partners, and for the negotiation of mutually beneficial measures such as end-user verification programmes (whereby selected third-country companies could be granted special status of ""Verified end-user"" and obtain EU-wide recognition and facilitation of controls). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : some specific provisions in the proposal are expected to have implications on the resources of relevant services at EU or national levels, in particular ; extended competence for the Commission to amend lists of dual-use items and general export authorisations by delegated acts ; cyber-surveillance controls expected to require some additional administrative costs (staff) for administrations, both at national and EU level; the realisation of certain actions – such as the development of electronic licensing systems – while the financing and budgetary implications remain to be assessed in detail before any decision is taken regarding their implementation. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
12962EP9,"""""EU Digital COVID Certificate - Union citizens""""",0.097,0.758,0.77,0.014,0.211,0.824,0.721,0.439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to extend the application of Regulation (EU) 2021/953 on a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable COVID-19 vaccination, test and recovery certificates (EU Digital COVID Certificate) to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2021/953, the epidemiological situation with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved considerably. On the one hand, by 31 January 2022, more than 80% of the adult population in the Union had completed their primary vaccination cycle, and more than 50% have received a booster dose, despite significant differences between Member States. Increasing vaccine uptake remains a crucial objective in the fight against the pandemic, given the protection against hospitalisation and severe disease afforded by vaccination, and thus plays an important role in ensuring that restrictions to the free movement of persons can be lifted. After a peak in Omicron cases, a high proportion of the population is expected to enjoy, at least for a certain period, protection from COVID-19 either due to vaccination or prior infection, or both. However, it is not possible to predict the impact of a possible increase in infections in the second half of 2022. In addition, the possibility of a worsening of the pandemic situation because of the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern cannot be ruled out. In view of the above, it cannot be excluded that Member States continue to require Union citizens exercising their right to free movement to present proof of COVID-19 vaccination, test or recovery beyond 30 June 2022, that is, the date when Regulation (EU) 2021/953 is currently set to expire. It is important to ensure that Union citizens and their family members are not deprived of the possibility to make use of their EU Digital COVID Certificates, which are an effective, secure and privacy-preserving way of proving one’s COVID-19 status, in the event that certain restrictions to free movement based on public health are still in place after 30 June 2022. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission is proposing to extend, by 12 months (until 30 June 2023), the application of Regulation (EU) 2021/953, which lays down a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable COVID-19 vaccination, test and recovery certificates (EU Digital COVID Certificate) for the purpose of facilitating the holders’ exercise of their right to free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. This should allow EU citizens and their family members exercising their right to free movement to continue demonstrating that they fulfil public health requirements imposed, in compliance with EU law, by the Member State of destination. In addition to the extension of the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation until June 2023, the Commission also proposes some limited amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/953 such as: - a broadening of the definition of SARS-CoV-2 tests that rely on the detection of viral proteins (antigens) to include antigenic assays performed in a laboratory setting and not only rapid antigen tests that give results in less than 30 minutes; - an explicit clarification that vaccination certificates are to contain the number of doses administered to the holder, regardless of the Member State in which they have been administered, to make sure that the overall number actually administered is accurately reflected; - a clarification that EU Digital COVID Certificates may also be issued to persons participating in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, and that such certificates may be accepted by other Member States in order to waive restrictions to free movement; - an extension by 12 months of the period of application set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/953, as well as of the power to adopt delegated acts with a view to adapting the information included in the vaccination certificate. The proposal notes that the domestic use of EU Digital COVID Certificates remains a matter for Member States to decide. The EU legislation on the EU Digital COVID Certificate neither prescribes nor prohibits the domestic use of EU Digital COVID Certificate (such as for access to events or restaurants). At the same time, where a Member State establishes a system of COVID-19 certificate for domestic purposes, it should continue to ensure that the EU Digital COVID Certificate is also fully accepted for those purposes. Beyond that, the Commission also encourages Member States to align their domestic validity periods with the validity period set at EU level for the purpose of travel."
7671EP8,"""""Copyright in the Digital Single Market""""",0.414,0.882,0.18,0.396,0.077,0.537,0.733,0.115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to modernise certain aspects of the Union copyright framework to take account of technological developments and new channels of distribution of protected content in the internal market PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: rapid technological developments continue to transform the way works and other subject-matter are created, produced, distributed and exploited. New business models and new actors continue to emerge. The objectives and the principles laid down by the Union copyright framework remain sound. However, legal uncertainty remains, for both rightholders and users, as regards certain uses, including cross-border uses, of works and other subject matter in the digital environment. As set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards a modern, more European copyright framework’, in some areas it is necessary to adapt and supplement the current Union copyright framework to ensure that the internal market does not fragment. In this context, the Commission has identified three areas of intervention with the aim of modernising the exceptions and limitations on copyright: (i) digital and cross-border uses in the field of education, (ii) text and data mining in the field of scientific research, and (iii) preservation of cultural heritage. The objective is to guarantee the legality of certain types of uses in these fields, including across borders. Evolution of digital technologies has reinforced the role of the Internet as the main marketplace for the distribution and access to copyright-protected content. In this new framework, rightholders face difficulties when seeking to license their rights and be remunerated for the online distribution of their works. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide for measures aiming at improving the position of rightholders to negotiate and be remunerated for the exploitation of their content by online services giving access to user-uploaded content. A fair sharing of value is also necessary to ensure the sustainability of the press publications sector. This proposal is presented in parallel with : a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes; a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examines the baseline scenarios, policy options and their impacts for eight topics regrouped under three chapters, namely (i) ensuring wider access to content, (ii) adapting exceptions to digital and cross-border environment and (iii) achieving a well-functioning marketplace for copyright. The assessment concluded that, bearing in mind the predominance of SMEs in the creative sectors, the introduction of a special regime would not be appropriate, as it would defeat the purpose of the intervention. CONTENT: complementing Directive 2010/13/EU and the proposal amending it, this draft directive lays down rules which aim at further harmonising the Union law applicable to copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, taking into account in particular digital and cross-border uses of protected content. It also lays down rules on exceptions and limitations, on the facilitation of licences as well as rules aiming at ensuring a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject matter. Measures to adapt exceptions and limitations to the digital and cross-border environment : Member States are obliged to provide for mandatory exceptions or a limitation allowing: text and data mining carried out by research organisations for the purposes of scientific research; digital uses of works and other subject-matter for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching, enabling teachers and students will be able to take full advantage of digital technologies; and cultural heritage institutions ((i.e. publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives or film or audio heritage institutions) to make copies of works and other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections to the extent necessary for their preservation. Measures to improve licensing practices and ensure wider access to content: the proposal requires Member States to: put in place a legal mechanism to facilitate licensing agreements of out-of-commerce works and other subject-matter; the cross-border effects will be ensured; put in place a stakeholder dialogue on issues relating to foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms and ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders; put in place a negotiation mechanism to facilitate negotiations on the online exploitation of audiovisual works. Measures to achieve a well-functioning marketplace for copyright : the proposal provides for: a new right for press publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recoupment of their investment and the enforcement of their rights; the rights granted to the publishers of press publications under this Directive should have the same scope as the rights of reproduction and making available to the public provided for in Directive 2001/29/EC, insofar as digital uses are concerned; the possibility for all publishers to receive a share in the compensation for uses of works under an exception; measures to improve transparency and better balanced contractual relationships between authors and performers and those to whom they assign their rights; the obligation for Member States to implement negotiation and dispute resolution mechanisms."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 17 July 2014 the negotiations were concluded with Ecuador for its accession to the Trade Agreement concluded between the EU and Colombia/Peru. As a result of these negotiations, a Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement was initialled between the parties. In order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption pending the completion of the procedures for the approval and application of the Protocol of Accession, it is necessary to ensure that customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased and that no new customs duties are applied on products originating in Ecuador. To this end, the proposed Regulation provides for the maintenance of the level of duty rates that were applicable to Ecuador on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to put in place an interim reciprocal arrangement for the establishment of a free-trade area with Ecuador in order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption, following the initialling of the Protocol of Accession. As from 1 January 2015 , customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased nor new customs duties applied on products originating in Ecuador. Duration of the application : the Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2015. It shall expire six months after the Protocol of Accession enters into force or, where appropriate, is applied provisionally, or on 31 December 2016, whichever occurs first. Condition for the application : Ecuador should abstain from introducing new duties or charges having equivalent effect or new quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect for imports originating in the Union, or from increasing existing levels of duties or charges or from introducing any other restrictions from [the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession]. Ecuador should also: maintain its commitment to core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance; be subject to benefit from the tariff treatment provided under this Regulation should be conditional on compliance by Ecuador with the relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto. In the event of failure to comply with any of the conditions laid down in this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to suspend temporarily in whole or in part the tariff treatment provided therein. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal maintains the current market access arrangements and in this sense does not have any additional financial implications for the EU budget. The absence of its application would, however, entail a potential increase in the customs revenue collection. The amount of this customs revenue collection is difficult to predict, but would in any case be relatively small. The duty savings incurred by current market access regime enjoyed by Ecuador and which lapses on 1 January 2015 are in the range of EUR 215 million (based on 2013 trade figures)."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: The present Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide. In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the number of people living in poverty continues to be a major problem in developing countries. While significant progress has been achieved, most developing countries remain off-track for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and are not able to successfully embark on the path of sustainable development in all its senses. To aggravate the situation, global challenges continue to be prominent and developing countries were hit hard by the succession of recent crises resulting inter alia in social and economic instability, increased migration, food insecurity and an increased vulnerability to external shocks, among other effects. It is increasingly recognised that environmental and natural resources, vital for sustainable socio-economic growth, are increasingly at risk from climate change and rapid population growth. The EU remains committed to helping developing countries to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty. To achieve this objective, the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) Regulation was established for the 2007-2013 period with the primary and overarching objective of eradicating poverty in partner countries and regions. This instrument consists of three categories of programmes: i) bilateral and regional geographic programmes covering cooperation with Asia, Latin America, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Africa ; ii) thematic programmes covering the following issues: investing in people, environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy, non-State actors and local authorities, food security, and migration and asylum; and iii) accompanying measures for sugar-producing countries. The current DCI regulation expires on 31 December 2013. The various reviews undertaken of the DCI have acknowledged its overall added value and its contribution to the achievement of the MDGs, but have also highlighted certain shortcomings. New challenges, together with the priorities set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the latest EU development policy, have prompted the Commission to make a proposal to review and adapt the DCI Regulation in line with the 2011 communication ""Increasing the Impact of EU Development Policy: An Agenda for Change"". IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission carried out an Impact Assessment (IA) that considered 3 basic policy alternatives: Option 1 : maintaining the DCI Regulation without any amendment and Option 2 : two alternatives for amending the DCI on each problem identified in the current DCI (Options 2A and 2B). Option 1 was not accepted because it would not solve the problems identified. Sub-options A and B under Option 2 solve the identified problems to different extents, each having particular political and other implications. The IA concluded that sub-option B is better as it differentiates clearly amongst partner countries and it streamlines the thematic programmes to provide the necessary flexibility to facilitate a more effective EU response to rapidly evolving situations in crisis, post-crisis and fragile states. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission establishes an instrument designed to finance: geographic programmes aimed at supporting cooperation with developing countries, territories and regions set out in the Annex to the Regulation (46 countries are concerned), which are included in the list of recipients of Official Development Assistance (ODA) of the OECD/DAC; thematic programmes to address global public goods and challenges and support civil society organisations and local authorities in countries, territories and regions eligible for Union funding under the European Neighbourhood Instrument, and ACP countries signatories to the Cotonou Agreement; a Pan-African programme to support the Joint Africa-EU Strategy in the countries, territories and regions covered by that Strategy. Objectives and eligibility criteria : the Regulation lays down the objectives and eligibility criteria for DCI II, as well as the EU’s development cooperation geographic and thematic programmes. The proposed regulation thus provides for the support of all forms of cooperation in developing countries. It requires fulfilling the criteria for ODA, subject to possible exceptions for the thematic and Pan-African programmes. For these programmes, a 10% flexibility for non-ODA activities is foreseen to cover for expenditure which; although not strictly speaking ODA-compliant, may be required for the adequate implementation of actions under these programmes. General principles: the proposal sets out the main principles governing the implementation of the Regulation, which are: democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law; differentiated approach towards the partner countries, taking into account their needs, capacities, commitments and performance, and potential EU impact; key cross-cutting issues (such as gender equality and women empowerment); strengthened coherence of EU external action; improved coordination with the Member States and other bilateral or multilateral donors; and a partner country-led and region-led development process with mutual accountability, through an inclusive and participatory approach to development, using effective and innovative cooperation modalities thus improving the impact of aid and reducing overlap and duplication. Geographic and Thematic programmes : the Regulation lays down the guiding principles: for the thematic programmes by means of which the EU assistance will be provided; the possible areas for cooperation and distinguishes between regional and bilateral cooperation. Differentiation : the principle of differentiation will be applied as often as possible. As a consequence, bilateral development assistance would be provided to those partner countries which need it the most, and lack the required financial capacities for their own development. Also, the differentiation principle takes into account the potential impact of the Union assistance in partner countries. Partner countries that shall benefit from bilateral development assistance are listed in the Annex to the Regulation. This Annex does not include countries ""graduated"" according to the following criteria: partner countries representing more than 1% of the world's GDP and/or upper middle income countries according to the list of recipients of ODA are in principle excluded. However, additional criteria relating to their need and capacity are used, such as Human Development Index, the Economic Vulnerability Index and aid dependency, as well as economic growth and foreign direct investment. Also the reliability of the available data is taken into consideration. All partner countries, however, would still benefit from regional and thematic programmes. Areas of intervention : the Regulation does not restrict the areas of EU cooperation or intervention. Any listing of such areas is purely illustrative. Areas may be chosen because they are pertinent to achieving the aims laid down in the Treaty, to the EU's international obligations and commitments or to the specific objectives provided for in the agreements with partner countries and regions. They should nevertheless be proposed with reference to the EU's objective of concentrating assistance, with a view to ensuring that the EU's policy and the policies of the Member States complement each other Thematic programmes : actions undertaken within thematic programmes bring an added value to actions financed under the geographic programmes. The characteristics of thematic programmes may be summarised as follows: Global Public Goods and Challenges : these actions will target the main global goods and challenges in a flexible and cross cutting manner. The main fields of activities that will be pursued by this programme include, inter alia, environment and climate change, sustainable energy, human development (including health, education, gender equality, employment, skills, social protection and social inclusion as well as economic development-related aspects such as growth, jobs, trade and private sector engagement), food security and migration and asylum. This thematic programme will enable swift response in view of unforeseen events and global crises (e.g. the food price crisis, avian flu). Civil Society Organisations and Local Authorities: programme in favour of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and Local Authorities (LAs) thematic which is based on the former Non-State Actors and Local Authorities programme. The focus of this programme has been sharpened with more attention given to capacity development of CSOs and LAs. The programme will promote an inclusive and empowered civil society and local authorities, increase awareness and mobilisation on development issues, and strengthen the capacity for policy dialogue on development. Pan-African programme : the Pan-African Programme is being set up to implement the Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES). It will be complementary and coherent with other financial instruments, notably the ENI, the EDF and the thematic programmes under DCI. While ENI and EDF focus on interventions at the regional or national level in Africa, the Pan-African programme shall be used to provide specific support for the objectives of the JAES, supporting in particular activities of transregional, continental and trans-continental nature, as well as relevant JAES initiatives in the global arena. Programming and allocation of funds : this article of the proposal lays down the general framework for geographical and thematic programming, as well as for the allocation of the funds under this Regulation. To ensure synergies and complementarity of the Union’s measures and those of the Member States, the Member States will be fully involved in the programming process. The consultation process will also include other donors and development actors as well as civil society and regional and local authorities. Provision is, in particular, made for the following: programming documents for geographic programmes with an indicative allocation and multiannual indicative programmes. These also list exceptions for when a strategy paper would not need to be prepared in order to simplify the programming process as well as to favour joint programming with Member States. The strategy papers will be drafted in dialogue with the partner countries and regions, with relevant involvement of the civil society and regional and local authorities; a Joint Framework Document that would lay down a comprehensive Union strategy, of which development policy would be part; Multiannual Indicative Programmes (MIP ) based on any programming documents, except when the total allocation would not exceed 30 million EUR. MIPs can be adjusted through a mid term or ad hoc review, in view of achieved objectives as well as in light of newly identified needs, such as those resulting from crisis, post-crisis or fragility situations. Flexibility : the draft regulation provides that a certain amount should not be allocated in order to increase the instrument’s flexibility and its ability to react to unexpected events (new priorities, natural or man-made disasters, etc.). Other provisions are made for: Programming for countries in crisis, post-crisis or fragility situation emphasising the special needs and circumstances of countries in crisis, post-crisis or fragility situation and providing for a special procedure in this case; Programming documents for thematic programmes may undergo a mid-term review; Approval of Strategy Papers and adoption of Multiannual Indicative Programmes. Coherence and complementarity : to make Union assistance more coherent and effective, and in particular to avoid programmes being split up among several different instruments, the proposed Regulation lays out the possibility to extend the eligibility of this Regulation to include all third countries, territories and regions, insofar as this contributes to the general objectives of the Regulation. Implementation : implementation has been considerably simplified, with an article stipulating that the Regulation shall be implemented in accordance with the future Regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. BUDGETARY IMPACT: in line with the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 establishing the budget for Europe 2020, the Commission proposes to allocate EUR 23.2947 billion to this instrument for the period 2014-2020. It is planned that no less than 50% of the programme for Global Public Goods and Challenges will be spent on climate change and environmental objectives and at least 20% on social inclusion and human development. Continued support for social inclusion and human development is foreseen through at least 20% of the Union's development aid. Lastly, this Regulation intends to contribute to addressing at least 20% of the Union's budget to creating low carbon and climate resilient societies. DELEGATED ACTS: it is proposed that flexibility be reinforced by using delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty to make it possible to amend certain non-essential elements of the Regulation that affects the subsequent programming (e.g. annexes on eligible countries, areas for cooperation and indicative financial allocation per programme for 2014-2020)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation requires that applications for marketing authorisation for a medicinal product, in a Member State or in the Union, be accompanied by a dossier containing the results of clinical trials carried out on the product. Sponsors are required, before the commencement of any clinical trial, to request authorisation from the competent authority of the Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Clinical trials necessitate the performance of multiple operations which may fall within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC (Directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms) or Directive 2009/41/EC (Directive on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms) in cases where the investigational medicinal product contains or consists of GMOs. Experience shows that, in clinical trials with investigational medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs, the procedure to achieve compliance with the requirements of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC as regards the environmental impact assessment and authorisation by the competent authority of a Member State is complex and may take a significant amount of time. The complexity of that procedure increases greatly in the case of multi-centre clinical trials conducted in several Member States, as sponsors of clinical trials need to submit multiple requests for authorisation to multiple competent authorities in different Member States in parallel. The Commission considers that it is of paramount importance that clinical trials with investigational medicinal products against COVID-19 containing or consisting of GMOs can be conducted within the Union, that they can begin as soon as possible, and that they are not delayed due to the complexity of differing national procedures put in place by Member States in implementation of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC. CONTENT: in the public health emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed Regulation aims to ensure that clinical trials with medicinal products for human use containing or consisting of GMOs to treat or prevent COVID-19 can start swiftly and without a prior environmental risk assessment and/or prior consent under Directive 2001/18/EC or Directive 2009/41/EC. The Regulation shall apply for as long as COVID-19 is considered a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or declared an emergency situation in accordance with Decision No 1082/2013/EU and remains so."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: reducing the negative impact of transport activities remains one of the main goals of the Union's transport policy. With the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in force, the transition to a modern and low-carbon economy will need to accelerate. Council Directive 92/106/EEC which establishes measures to encourage the development of combined transport, is the only legislative act of the Union to directly incentivise the shift from road freight to lower emission transport modes such as inland waterways, maritime and rail. However, since the Directive was adopted in 1992, some of these conditions, e.g. the use of paper transport documents and stamps as proof of eligibility for combined transport and the freight market environment have undergone considerable changes. While the Directive has helped shift a considerable amount of freight away from road, shortcomings in the implementation of that Directive and the limited scope of its support measures, have significantly reduced its impact. According to estimations, the goal of reaching 30% of road freight over 300 km shifted to other modes of transport such as rail or waterborne transport by 2030, and more than 50% by 2050, in order to optimise the performance of multimodal logistic chains, including by making greater use of more energy-efficient modes, has been slower than expected and according to the current projections, will not be reached. In order to improve the competitiveness of combined transport compared to long-distance road freight, thereby strengthening the shift to other modes for the transport of goods, the Commission considers that a revision of the Directive is necessary in order to: (i) clarifying and extending the definition of combined transport; (ii) improving the monitoring of eligibility and enforcement conditions; (iii) increasing the effectiveness of incentives; and (iv) improving the reporting and monitoring conditions of the Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the strategic option chosen aims to simplify the eligibility criteria, better define the enforcement conditions and broaden the economic support measures. CONTENT: this initiative aims to support multimodality and strengthen the shift from road freight by addressing the shortcomings of the existing legislation (Directive 92/106/EEC) and in particular by extending its scope using a broader set of possible support measures. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to: review the definition of ‘combined transport’ by extending its scope to national services and by further specifying the maximum distance of the road leg as 150 km or 20 % of the total distance, irrespective of the non-road leg type (rail, inland waterways or maritime), while ensuring that flexibility is allowed due to specific geographical or operational constraints in Member States; extend the economic support measures put in place by the Member States, i.e. investment support and operational support (e.g. vehicle tax breaks) and additional support measures that Member States may adopt to complement existing ones in order to reduce the cost of a combined transport operation and to make it more competitive compared to the equivalent road-only operation; specifies which documents an operator must provide to demonstrate the existence of combined transport and receive assistance from the State. Thus, the proposal: (i) defines the condition for road transport to be considered as part of a combined transport operation; (ii) lists and details the data to be provided as evidence; (iii) states that no additional document shall be required to prove the combined transport operation; (iv) provides the conditions of presentation of the evidence, including for the purposes of a roadside check. The Commission proposes to use documents in electronic format more efficiently; introduces the obligation for Member States to report to the Commission, 18 months after the date for transposition of the Directive, data on the conditions of the combined transport market in their territory, including on the relevant infrastructure and the adopted national support measures. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in recent years experience has shown that there was scope to simplify the existing legal framework for the development and uptake of novel fibres, with a view to encourage innovation in the textile and clothing sector and to allow fibre users and consumers to benefit faster from innovative products. The revision of EU legislation on Textile Names and Labelling 1 was announced in 2006. The purpose is to enhance the transparency of the process of adding new fibres to the list of harmonised fibre names and introduce more flexibility to adapt legislation in order to keep up with the technological developments expected in the textiles industry.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission carried out an impact assessment of the various policy options, which led to the following conclusions: (i) the inclusion of guidance on the contents of the application file and the recognition of laboratories in assisting companies in compiling the file could bring significant time savings for both industry and public authorities; (ii) the greatest benefits for industry would arise from reducing the time taken between an application for a new fibre name being submitted and the ability to place the fibre on the market with the new name; (iii) Member States benefit from replacing the Directives with a Regulation, because they would no longer need to transpose the amendments into national legislation; (iv) consumers would benefit from knowing that fibres meet specified characteristics.  CONTENT: the proposed revision is of limited scope. It does not aim to extend EU legislation to other labelling requirements beyond the fibre composition and the harmonisation of textile fibre names covered by the existing Directives. The main changes to the existing legislation can be summarised as follows: Facilitating the legislative process to adapt legislation to technical progress: this involves transforming Directive 96/74/EC into a Regulation, and repealing Directives 96/73/EC and 73/44/EEC. Given their detailed technical content, the adaptation of uniform methods is better addressed in the form of annexes to the main Regulation. The proposed Regulation includes an Annex VIII, laying down uniform methods used for official tests. Shortening the time between the submission of an application and the adoption of the new fibre name: i n order to allow fibre manufacturers, fibre users and consumers to benefit faster from the use of novel fibres and innovative products, new fibre names should be adopted in EU legislation more rapidly. In addition to the time gained with the changing of Directive 96/74/EC into a Regulation, the time necessary for the technical examination of requests for new fibre names may be reduced if application files submitted by manufacturers are more correct and complete with respect to the requirements they need to fulfil. The proposal introduces the procedure to be followed by a manufacturer to request the addition of a new fibre name to the technical annexes of the Regulation. The manufacturer needs to submit an application file to the Commission, taking into consideration the minimum requirements set out in Annex II. The Commission will present a report after 5 years, which will focus on assessing the experience obtained with the applications for new fibre names received in that period and it will examine if further gains on time may be obtained from a revision of proposed procedures."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices establishes a new regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices, such as HIV tests, pregnancy tests or SARS-CoV-2 tests. The new Regulation will replace the current Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices from 26 May 2022 and introduce substantial changes in the sector. One of the main changes concerns the involvement of independent conformity assessment bodies (‘notified bodies’). Currently, only a relatively small number of high-risk devices (about 8% of all in vitro diagnostics on the market) is subject to notified body control under Directive 98/79/EC. Under the Regulation, around 80% of in vitro diagnostic medical devices will be under the control of notified bodies, the vast majority of them for the first time. The COVID-19 public health crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that demand substantial additional resources, as well as increased availability of vitally important in vitro diagnostic medical devices, that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of Regulation (EU) 2017/746. Data on market readiness collected by the European Commission show that Member States, health institutions, notified bodies and economic operators will not be in a position to comply with the new rules within the timeframe foreseen. In vitro diagnostic medical devices are essential for the health and safety of Union citizens and SARS-CoV-2 tests, in particular, are vital for the fight against the pandemic. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the transitional arrangements to allow for a gradual implementation of the Regulation in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of these devices on the Union market. The European Parliament, in a cross-party letter of 11 May 2021 signed by several political groups, called on the Commission to present a legislative proposal to smooth the transition to the new regulatory framework and to ensure the availability of in vitro diagnostic medical devices on the EU market. CONTENT: in order to ensure legal certainty and to avoid potential market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend the existing transitional period for devices covered by a certificate issued under Directive 98/79/EC and to introduce tailored transitional periods for devices that are to be subject to conformity assessment involving notified bodies for the first time under Regulation (EU) 2017/746. The length of the transitional period should depend on the risk class of the device concerned: - for high-risk devices such as HIV or hepatitis tests (class D) and certain influenza tests (class C), the transitional period ends on 26 May 2025 and 26 May 2026, and - for low-risk devices such as Class B and A sterile devices, 26 May 2027. The Commission proposes to also introduce a transitional period for the requirements for devices manufactured and used within the same health institution (‘in-house devices’). This will give health institutions extra time to comply with the new requirements and ensure that in-house tests, which are often essential –especially for rare diseases, can continue to be developed in clinical laboratories."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: sustainability and the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient, more resource-efficient and circular economy are key in ensuring long-term competitiveness of the Union’s economy. In March 2018, the Commission published its action plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth' setting up an ambitious and comprehensive strategy on sustainable finance. One of the objectives set out in that action plan is to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. In line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Agenda, this proposal is part of a broader Commission initiative to facilitate investment in sustainable projects and assets across the European Union. In particular, it defines uniform criteria for determining whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable. The proposal is presented in parallel with: a proposal to bring institutional investors (management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), alternative investment fund managers (AIFs), insurance undertakings, institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs), European venture capital fund managers (EuVECA), European social entrepreneurship fund managers (EuSEF) and investment firms) to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their internal processes and inform their clients in this respect; a proposal to help investors compare the carbon footprint of investments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is that of a unified EU classification system (or taxonomy). An EU uniform classification would help determine which activities can be considered sustainable and send the right signals to economic actors, as it would translate EU policy objectives into concrete guidelines for identifying relevant projects or investments. It could therefore help to direct more capital towards sustainable investments. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to standardise the criteria for determining whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable for the purposes of establishing the degree of environmental sustainability of an investment. Environmental sustainability criteria for economic activities : the proposal provides for criteria and a procedure for identifying environmentally sustainable investments, in order to avoid distortions of the single market due to differences in the interpretation of this concept between Member States. According to these criteria, the economic activity should contribute substantially to one or more environmental objectives without causing significant harm to any other. These environmental objectives are: (1) climate change mitigation; (2) climate change adaptation; (3) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; (4) transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling; (5) pollution prevention and control; (6) protection of healthy ecosystems. In recognition of the principles enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, economic activity should also be pursued in accordance with minimum international social and labour standards. The Commission may adopt delegated acts specifying the technical screening criteria for determining what constitutes a substantial contribution to an environmental objective and what constitutes substantial harm to other objectives, those criteria also apply. Disclosure obligations : the proposal requires those financial market participants that are subject to the disclosure obligations set out in the proposed Regulation on improving sustainability disclosure referenced above (e.g. fund managers) to disclose the degree of environmental sustainability of those financial products that they claim pursue environmental objectives. If a fund manager offers a fund claiming it is a 'green fund', then for that particular fund the manager will have to indicate the way and the extent to which the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities were used to determine the environmental sustainability of the investment in the fund's pre-contractual disclosure document. Sustainable Finance Platform : the proposal provides for a process involving a multi-stakeholder Platform to establish at EU level a uniform classification system based on a set of clear criteria to determine which economic activities may be considered sustainable. This Platform will assist the Commission in the progressive development and the update of the EU classification system. The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) will play a key role in developing the European sustainability taxonomy to ensure that it is usable by financial institutions, applicable to financial products and compatible with EU financial legislation. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) will also be closely involved in the sustainable finance work. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Commission will be responsible for managing the Platform (e.g. organising its meetings and meetings of any sub-groups, reporting on the outcome, preparing legislative proposals, liaising with the ESAs and the EEA, maintaining an IT collaborative tool, reimbursing experts, performing other secretarial tasks, etc). In order to accomplish these and other tasks, the European Commission would need 10 full-time employees as of 2020. The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 10.496 million for the period 2020-2023."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) governed by Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European Parliament and the Council strengthens cooperation between the Union and the Member States and facilitates coordination in the field of civil protection in order to improve the Union's response to natural and man-made disasters. Several recent disasters have hit several Member States simultaneously: the refugee and migration crisis and its humanitarian impact, terrorist attacks, the lack of available assets during the 2016 and 2017 forest fire seasons that resulted in over 100 deaths as well as the severe impact of a series of hurricanes in the Caribbean and fierce storms and flooding in the EU, have constituted a real stress test for the UCPM. Recent experience has shown that reliance on voluntary offers of mutual assistance, coordinated and facilitated by the Union Mechanism, does not always ensure that sufficient capacities are made available to address the basic needs of people affected by disasters in a satisfactory manner, nor that the environment and property are properly safeguarded. Following the interim evaluation of the UCPM, the examination of the UCPM by the European Court of Auditors and the report on the gaps in critical reaction capacity published in early 2017, the Commission considered it necessary to strengthen European civil protection in the light of disaster trends, including extreme weather, and against the background of internal security concerns. The proposed changes are part of the broader objective of working towards a ‘Europe that protects’. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Decision No 1313/2013/EU has the following objectives: (i) to improve disaster prevention and preparedness capabilities; (ii) to improve collective response capacity at European level; and (iii) to ensure the flexibility and efficiency of the administrative procedures of the Union Mechanism when it is involved in emergency operations. Reinforcement of European reaction assets : the proposal provides for the creation at Union level of a dedicated reserve of reaction assets (called ‘rescEU’) to be deployed by decision of the Commission, which will have the command and control. rescEU will be equipped with selected emergency capacities to respond to wildfires, floods, earthquakes and health emergencies as appropriate. rescEU shall be established to provide relief where existing capacities do not allow responding effectively to disasters. It shall consist of the following capacities: aerial forest firefighting; high capacity pumping; urban search and rescue; field hospital and emergency medical teams. All costs of these capacities would be fully covered by EU financing . At the same time, the Commission proposes to strengthen the European emergency response capacity where Member States can pre-commit national response capacities. This shall be known as the ‘European Civil Protection Reserve’. Under the new proposal, assets committed to the European Civil Protection Pool will benefit from a 75% coverage of all costs incurred during UCPM operations within the Union, including adaptation, repair, transportation and operational costs. The proposal also strengthens the incentives to pool capacities. Increased capacity for prevention and preparedness : the proposal strengthens the links between prevention, preparedness and response by connecting risk assessment to risk management planning and requiring Member States to provide their risk management plans to the Commission at the latest by 31 January 2019. Prevention plans need to include short-term actions and longer-term prevention efforts to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change. Consistency with other EU instruments in the area of disaster risk reduction and prevention should also be strengthened by linking the EU Mechanism with cohesion and rural development policies as well as health and research. The proposal also includes provisions to ensure that the disbursement of EU funds through the Union mechanism is accompanied by adequate visibility. It also paves the way for the establishment of a dedicated structure, the Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network, which will reinforce the training component of the UCPM, in close cooperation with existing relevant national structures on the matter. More efficient administrative procedures : the proposal seeks to streamline administrative procedures in order to reduce delays in the deployment of aid. It simplifies the current system by introducing a single category of response means, the use of which requires co-financing by the Member States and the EU budget, namely the European Civil Protection Reserve. In addition, specific provisions limiting the activation of the Union mechanism to a 90-day period (unless otherwise justified) have been included in order to clarify the scope and to encourage the use of the means in the immediate reaction. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for the implementation of the Union Mechanism for the period covered by the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 is EUR 368.4 million. This proposal seeks a total overall increase in the UCPM financial envelope for the period 2018-2020 of EUR 280 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: in the framework of the common fisheries policy established by Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, multi-annual plans should contribute to achieving fishing at sustainable levels (Maximum Sustainable Yield). The fisheries of the North Sea and adjacent areas are highly complex, involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, as well as Norway, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. The proposal presented by the Commission establishes a plan taking into account such mixed fisheries interactions. The Basic Regulation aims at solving the problems of overfishing and discarding fish. However, without additional legislation, the Basic Regulation could lead to under-utilisation of quota in the North Sea mixed fisheries and would not allow any exemptions from the landing obligation to be adopted after the three year discard plans have expired. Hence, if no appropriate measures are taken, the Basic Regulation might have negative economic and social consequences for the fishing industry in the coming years. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice (a single mixed fishery multi-annual plan for North Sea demersal fisheries), wherein FMSY (maximum rate of fishing mortality) is achieved by 2020 at the latest and stocks are rebuilt to within precautionary levels quickly is judged to be more effective than Option 1 (to manage using the Basic Regulation) to achieve the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP set out in Regulation 1380/2013. The plan will: ensure the sustainable exploitation of these stocks, by ensuring that they are exploited according to the principles of maximum sustainable yield and of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management; provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on stocks, mixed fisheries and other aspects of the ecosystem and environment; facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation. The proposal aims to replace the current plan for cod, as well as the plan for plaice and sole by bringing all multi-annual plans for the different demersal stocks into one regulation. The plan will apply to all Union fishing vessels irrespective to their overall length in fishing in the North Sea as this is in conformity with the rules of the CFP and is in line with the effect of the vessels on the fish stocks concerned. The proposed plan: requires the EU to set catch limits that restore and maintain fish stocks above levels that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); defines ranges within which catch limits can be set. Fishing opportunities in the higher part of the ranges will only be possible under clearly defined conditions and in line with the MSY approach; establishes safeguard measures for biomass based on the precautionary approach laid out in the Basic Regulation; obliges the EU to take swift action when the sustainability of any demersal North Sea fish stock is threatened; establishes the necessary framework for implementing regionalisation within the North Sea and provides for regional cooperation among Member States regarding the adoption of measures on the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for certain stocks; adopt thresholds above which catches of demersal stocks should only be landed in designated ports; does not include annual limits on fishing effort (the numbers of days at sea). There will be periodic evaluation (every five years) of the impact of the plan on the stock concerned based on scientific advice."
1084EP7,"""""Indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries""""",0.105,0.722,0.842,0.452,0.455,0.735,0.81,0.743,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down rules on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported into the Community from third countries. PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in December 2003, the Commission submitted to the Council a working document on a possible EU origin marking scheme, following a renewed interest shown on the subject by some Member States and some sectors. The Member States and the sectors in question were expressing a growing concern over the mounting incidence of misleading and/or fraudulent origin marks being carried by imported products. In the first half of 2004, the Commission launched a consultation process on this question involving the main stakeholders - industry, trade unions, consumers and other institutions - the results of which were discussed in the Council by a specific committee. Based on the results of that consultation process, the draft Regulation proposes the introduction of a compulsory origin marking scheme covering a number of sectors which see benefit in the initiative and applicable to imported goods only. At present, the European Community has no legislation on the use of origin marking (“made in”) for industrial products. Directive 2005/29/EC aiming to harmonise in-market control of unfair commercial practices also addresses instances of a misleading use of origin indications. However, this directive does not define the meaning of “made in”; nor does it enable controls by customs authorities. Rules on the voluntary use of origin marks which exist in some Member States also differ. The current situation puts the EC at a disadvantage vis-à-vis its trading partners (e.g. Canada, China, Japan and the US) who require origin marking for imports. It deprives EC producers of origin-sensitive consumer goods to realise benefits associated with producing within the European Community, and an opportunity is missed to more effectively prevent false/or misleading origin claims. This draft regulation aims to address these shortcomings. LEGAL BASE: Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to lay down rules and conditions applicable to the indication of origin of goods imported or placed on the Community market. Its main provisions may be summarised as follows: Definition of country of origin: the regulation opts for a definition of the country of origin based on the EC non-preferential rules of origin, as applied for other customs purposes. The application of the EC non-preferential rules of origin to origin marking issues is consistent with EC’s commitments derived from the WTO Agreement on rules of origin. Scope: this Regulation should apply to imported industrial products, excluding fishery and aquaculture products as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, and also excluding foodstuff as defined in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority. Goods that require marking are those listed in the Annex to this draft Regulation, and imported from third countries, except for goods originating in the Territory of the European Communities, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, and the Contracting Parties of the EEA Agreement. Goods in travellers’ personal luggage for personal use should be exempted from the application of this draft Regulation within the limits laid down in respect of relief from customs duty. Goods may also be exempted from origin marking, when for technical or commercial reasons, it appears impossible to mark them. Origin marking requirements: in order to reduce the burden of the new scheme as much as possible, the Regulation limits the requirements and conditions to mark the products to the minimum needed to make sure that the origin mark is easily detected and understood by the consumer, but at the same time not easily replaced or faked. The origin marking shall appear in clearly legible and indelible characters, it shall be visible during normal handling, markedly distinct from other information, and be presented in a way which is not misleading nor likely to create an erroneous impression with regard to the origin of the product. As to the language version, the Regulation gives the option of using the words “made in” or other similar expressions in any official language of the European Community, understood by the ultimate purchaser. Possibility to extend the marking system to other sectors by the Commission: recognising that the specific means of fixing a mark of origin may depend on the type of product, the draft Regulation entitles the Commission to further regulate this aspect. Considering also that other sectors could be interested in joining the origin marking scheme, or that origin marking may prove less relevant for others, the Regulation would also entitle the Commission to include or to suppress sectors. Penalties: the Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this regulation. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Where goods are not in compliance with this Regulation, Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to require the owner of the goods or any other person responsible for them to mark these goods in accordance with this Regulation and at their own expense. FINANCIAL IMPACT: the proposal has no financial impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides, inter alia, that authorisation schemes and certain types of requirements related to services must be non-discriminatory with regard to nationality or residence, justified by an overriding reason related to the public interest. To make sure that new measures imposed by Member States actually fulfil these conditions and thus facilitate the competitiveness and integration of the single market in services, the Services Directive provides that Member States shall notify to the Commission new or changed authorisation schemes or certain new or changed requirements falling under the Directive. Commission assessments have shown, however, that the current notification procedure under the Services Directive does not always achieve its objective. The Commission therefore presents a self-standing legislative instrument modernising the current notification procedure under the Services Directive in order to improve the enforcement of the existing provisions of that Directive. This proposal is included in the continuation of the Single Market Strategy. The European Council called for ambition in delivering the Single Market Strategy and for the different Single Market strategies to be completed and implemented by 2018. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice is a combination of options to use a legislative initiative to enable identified shortcomings to be addressed and establish an effective and efficient notification procedure with only a small increase in administrative costs for national public authorities and the Commission. CONTENT: the notification procedure established by the proposed Directive aims to ensure that certain national restrictions to the freedom of establishment and to the freedom to provide services will comply with the Services Directive, contributing to its better enforcement. Notification obligation : Member States shall notify to the Commission any draft measure that introduces new requirements or authorisation schemes, or modifies such existing requirements or authorisation schemes. The proposal also provides that Member States have to notify authorisation schemes, certain establishment requirements, certain requirements affecting the freedom to provide services and requirements concerning professional liability insurance and multidisciplinary activities. Consultation, alert and Decision : the proposal establishes a consultation period of three months following the notification of a draft measure. The Commission and other Member States have a maximum of two months to comment on a notified measure, followed by a maximum of one month for the notifying Member State to respond to such comments. The Commission may issue an alert to the notifying Member State where after assessing the notified measure it has concerns about its compliance with the Services Directive. The issuing of an alert implies that the Member State concerned shall not adopt the notified measure at issue for three months. After an alert has been issued, the Commission may adopt a legally binding Decision finding the notified measure to be incompatible with the Services Directive and requesting the notifying Member State to refrain from adopting it. Information to the public : the proposal provides for transparency to third parties of notified draft measures, accompanying information and the final adopted measures. In order to ensure an effective exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission, the Internal Market Information System set up by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 (IMI Regulation) of the European Parliament and of the Council should continue to be used under this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT Convention) aims, by establishing the ICCAT, to promote cooperation in maintaining the populations of tuna and tuna-like fish in the Atlantic Ocean at levels that permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes. The Convention entered into force on 21 March 1969. The Union is a party to the Convention, having approved it pursuant to the Council Decision of 9 June 1986. From 2013 to 2018, discussions took place within the ICCAT Commission on the changes that are needed to the Convention. As a result, a Protocol has been drafted to amend to the Convention. The Protocol amending ICCAT, once signed (and provisionally applied from the date of its entry into force for other Contracting Parties, pending its entry into force for the Union), must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Protocol to amend the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The Protocol is consistent with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides that the Union shall: - ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and are managed in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food supplies; - apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and is to aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains population of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield; - adopt management and conservation measures based on best available scientific advice, to support the development of scientific knowledge and advice, to gradually eliminate discards and to promote fishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing and the avoidance and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, to fishing with low impact on the marine ecosystem and fishery resources; - apply those objectives and principles in the conduct of its external fisheries relations. In accordance with the Joint Communication by the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission ‘International ocean governance: an agenda for the future of oceans’6 and the Council conclusions on that Joint Communication, promoting measures to support and enhance the effectiveness of RFMOs and, where relevant, improve their governance is a central feature of the Union’s action in these fora. The Protocol meets these objectives."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: with the development of e-commerce, the scope and size of markets in which businesses and consumers operate have grown significantly and extend beyond national borders. The lack of effective redress for complaints resulting from cross-border online transactions has adverse consequences both for consumers and businesses. Consumers as well as traders, however, perceive it as risky to engage in cross-border e-commerce transactions because they fear that relevant disputes might not easily be resolved due to the virtual character of the transaction. The Europe 2020 flagship initiative ""Digital Agenda for Europe"" announced an EU strategy to improve ADR systems. The 2011 Single Market Act included amongst its key priorities the establishment of simple, fast and affordable out-of-court settlement procedures for consumers and protecting relations between businesses and their customers. This action will also include an electronic commerce dimension. At present, the offer of ADR schemes to resolve consumer disputes related to e-commerce transactions is scattered and incomplete. In addition, while half the existing ADR schemes offer consumers the possibility of submitting their complaint online, very few offer consumers the possibility of conducting the entire procedure online (via online dispute resolution – ODR). Handling the entire process online would produce time savings and ease communication between the parties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has carried out a detailed impact assessment, analysing a range of policy options for (i) Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) coverage, information and quality and (ii) Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) for cross-border e-commerce transactions. The IA concluded that only a combination of two instruments on ADR and ODR can ensure access to impartial, transparent and effective means to resolve consumer disputes linked to cross-border e-commerce transactions out-of-court. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims at establishing an EU-wide ODR system that will facilitate the resolution of disputes related to the cross-border online sale of goods or provision of services between a trader and a consumer. The main points of the proposal are as follows: ODR platform : the proposal aims at establishing a European online dispute resolution platform (""ODR platform""). This ODR platform takes the form of an interactive website which offers a single point of entry to consumers and traders who seek to resolve out-of-court a dispute which has arisen from a cross-border e-commerce transaction. The platform can be accessed in all official languages of the EU and its use is free of charge. ADR schemes established in the Member States, which have been notified to the Commission in accordance with the Directive on consumer ADR, will be registered electronically with the ODR platform. Consumers and traders will be able to submit their complaints through an electronic complaint form which will be available on the platform’s website in all official languages of the EU. The platform will check if a complaint can be processed and seek the agreement of the parties to transmit it to the ADR scheme that is competent to deal with the dispute. The competent ADR scheme will seek the resolution of the dispute in accordance with its own rules of procedure within 30 days from the date of receipt of the complaint. The ADR scheme will have to notify to the platform some data in relation to the development of the dispute (date when the complaint was notified to the parties; date when the dispute was resolved; outcome of the dispute). Under the proposal, a network of online dispute resolution facilitators (""ODR facilitators' network"") will provide support to the resolution of disputes submitted via the ODR platform. Information on the EU-wide ODR system : traders established within the EU that engage in cross-border e- commerce to inform consumers about the ODR platform. This information shall be made easily, directly, prominently and permanently accessible on the traders' websites as well as when the consumer submit a complaint to the trader. Monitoring: an annual activity report will be drawn up on the operation of the platform. The compliance by ADR schemes with the obligations set out in the Regulation will be monitored by the competent authorities to be established in the Member States in accordance with the Directive on consumer ADR. Every three years the Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of the Regulation. Data Protection rules: the data entered in the ODR platform by the parties and the ADR schemes will be stored in a database and will be subject to the relevant legislation on data protection. BUDGETRY IMPLICATIONS: this action is part of the Consumer programme 2014-2020. The budgetary impact will be addressed by redeployment for the years 2012 and 2013. The financial appropriations for implementing this proposal from 2012 to 2020 will amount to EUR 4,586 million in current prices. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
3462EP7,"""""European statistical programme 2013-2017""""",0.789,0.868,0.947,0.645,0.242,0.831,0.913,0.057,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European statistical programme 2013-2017. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he current Community Statistical Programme, adopted by a European Parliament and Council Decision No 1578/2007/EC and covering the period from 2008 to 2012, is the seventh of its kind. In recent years the European Statistical System has been faced with a number of challenges. (1) the need for European statistics has been constantly increasing, and this trend is unlikely to change in future. (2) the nature of statistics has changed — evidence-based decision making requires statistics that meet high quality criteria linked to the specific purposes they are serving, and there is an increasing need for complex multidimensional statistics supporting composite policy areas. (3) due to the appearance of new actors on the information market, including those providing information in nearly real time, the priority for the ESS in future is high quality and, in the case of short-term statistics, timeliness in particular. (4) budget constraints at both national and European level as well as the need to further reduce the burden on enterprises and citizens make the situation even more challenging. The Commission Communication on the production method of EU statistics: a vision for the next decade and the ESS strategy for its implementation15 address all these challenges by aiming to reengineer the ways of working in the ESS in order to make it more efficient and flexible. The implementation of this Communication constitutes the core of the proposed European statistical programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: prior to the preparation of this proposal, the users of European statistics, i.e. the Directorates-General of the Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, were consulted. In the framework of the impact assessment, after thorough consideration and analysis of the different scenarios, the number of options has been reduced to three: Option 1: ""zero option"" with no European Statistical Programme : the risks related to this option are high because in this case no legal framework for the production of European statistics would exist, so that their quality and the efficiency of statistical production would not be ensured. In these cases statistics would be produced in an uncoordinated way by different producers. Option 2: ESP 2013-17 will be a repetition of the CSP 2008-2012 : the risks involved in this option are linked to the fact that statistics provided would correspond to partially outdated policy priorities which are produced according to the traditional method, i.e. without taking advantage of the new method of production of European statistics aiming at efficiency gains and quality improvements. The costs of inadequate statistics would be considerable. Option 3: a new five-year European Statistical Programme is established : the risks linked to this option are considered to be relatively low as in this case European statistics would be produced under the established legal framework, i.e. the quality of statistics and the efficiency of the production method would be ensured as European statistics would be developed, collected and disseminated in a coordinated way. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes the European statistical programme for the period from 2013 to 2017. The programme provides the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, the main fields and the objectives of the actions envisaged for the programming period. The main purpose of European statistics is to underpin the development, monitoring and evaluation of European policies with reliable, objective, comparable and coherent factual information. The current proposal is consistent with the Union’s priorities as statistics developed, produced and disseminated under this programme will contribute to the implementation of the EU’s priority policies, such as the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and other policies addressed in the Commission’s strategic priorities for 2010-2014 (i.e. strengthened and integrated economic governance, climate change, growth and social cohesion, people’s Europe and globalisation). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: total amount to be borne by the budget of the EU is €299.4 million (current prices) for the duration of the programme from 2013 to 2017, of which €57.3 million is covered by the programming period 2007 to 2013 and €242.1 million by the programming period 2014 to 2017."
4824EP8,"""""EU-Canada Strategic Partnership Agreement""""",0.843,0.928,0.88,0.042,0.077,0.91,0.686,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to conclude the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 8 December 2010, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Canada, of the other part. The negotiations on the Agreement commenced in September 2011 and concluded in September 2014 with initialling of the Agreement. Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Agreement on 28 October 2016, the Agreement was signed on 30 October 2016 at the 16th EU-Canada Summit. The present joint proposal concerns the legal instrument concluding the Agreement. Note on legal basis: Article 218(6)(a)(iii) TFEU states that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council shall adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU states that the Council shall act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the common foreign and security policy and technical cooperation with developed countries. These aspects of the Agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for adopting a Union act. The Agreement establishes an institutional framework for cooperation between the EU and Canada. The legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 TEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The aim of the Agreement is to strengthen existing cooperation between the Parties, which is based on the 1976 Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, in order to cover political dialogue and common foreign and security policy-related issues, and a broad range of sectors including environment, justice and security, migration and integration, fisheries, education, culture, human rights, northern development and indigenous issues, youth exchanges and transport security. The Agreement (SPA) envisages several kinds of cooperation: Political cooperation: the aim of the SPA is to strengthen EU - Canada political ties and cooperation on foreign and security issues, and to advance cooperation on a large number of policy areas besides trade and economics. The Agreement enshrines EU-Canada common democratic values and will advance cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral level. The SPA will strengthen political dialogue in fields such as: It reaffirms the Parties' commitment to safeguarding international peace and security by preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and undertaking measures to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Institutional cooperation: the SPA provides the mechanism for conducting political dialogue by organising annual summits at leaders level and consultations at ministerial level. It also establishes a Joint Ministerial Committee, which replaces the previous Transatlantic Dialogue, and a Joint Cooperation Committee with the objective of monitoring the development of the strategic relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement provides for the possibility of suspending its application in case of a violation of essential elements of the Agreement such as human rights and non-proliferation. In addition, the Parties recognise that a particularly serious and substantial violation of human rights or non-proliferation could also serve as grounds for the termination of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). The SPA, in conjunction with the CETA, is expected to provide tangible benefits and opportunities to the citizens of the EU and Canada."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In December 2009, the Council agreed on the principle of launching bilateral negotiations with individual ASEAN countries based on the authorisation and negotiating directives of 2007, whilst preserving the strategic objective of a region-to-region agreement. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007 and supplemented in October 2013 to include investment protection, the Commission negotiated with Vietnam an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. Vietnam is a vibrant economy of more than 90 million inhabitants, with the fastest growing middle class in ASEAN, and a young and dynamic workforce. With its high literacy rate and education levels, comparatively low wages, good connectivity and a central location within ASEAN, more and more foreign investors are choosing Vietnam as their hub to service the Mekong region and beyond.

The agreement, signed subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. The EU-Vietnam IPA will ensure a high level of investment protection, while safeguarding the EU’s and Vietnam’s rights to regulate and pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as the protection of public health, safety and the environment."
7507EP8,"""""Enforcement requirements and specific rules for posting drivers in the road transport sector""""",0.429,0.575,0.06,0.062,0.115,0.701,0.293,0.269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to adapt social rules applying to the road transport sector in order to ensure a balance between the drivers' social protection and operators' freedom to provide cross-border services. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: among the main social rules applying to the transport sector are the following: provisions on the organisation of drivers' working time set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; minimum requirements for enforcement set out in Directive 2006/22/EC; rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods under Regulation (EC) No 561/2006; provisions on posting of workers established in Directive 96/71/EC and the enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU. The current evaluation of the social legislation in road transport in the EU has shown shortcomings in the current legal framework and problems regarding enforcement. Furthermore, a number of discrepancies exist between Member States in interpretation, application and implementation of the rules. This creates legal uncertainty and unequal treatment of drivers and operators, which is detrimental to the working, social and competition conditions in the sector. The Commission aims to amend the existing rules in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable, whilst at the same time mitigating the excessive regulatory burdens on operators and preventing distortions of competition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four options were considered. The first policy option focused on clarifying the legal framework and increasing cooperation between enforcement authorities. The second focused on strengthening enforcement and improving working patterns for workers. The third proposed substantive changes in the rules, in particular banning performance based pay. The fourth option comprised sector specific criteria and specific enforcement measures for the posting of workers in the road transport sector. Significant savings for operators result mainly from the latter option, and in particular the measures on administrative and control requirements. These savings are in the range of EUR 785 million per year in administrative costs. CONTENT: the proposal makes a limited number of amendments to Directive 2006/22/EC and lays down sector-specific rules on posting of workers in the road transport sector in relation to Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU. Requirements on enforcement : the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2006/22/EC in order to: require that checks carried out by Member States include checking compliance with the working time provisions set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; require that the information submitted by Member States to the Commission on the results of checks at the roadside and at premises to include checks on compliance with Directive 2002/15/EC; specify that serious infringements giving rise to checks at premises of road transport undertakings shall also include infringements of Directive 2002/15/EC; improve administrative cooperation between Member States with regard to the implementation of the social rules in road transport has proven insufficient, making cross-border enforcement more difficult, inefficient and inconsistent. It is therefore necessary to establish a framework for effective communication and mutual assistance, including exchange of data on infringements and information on good practices in enforcement; further improve the effectiveness, and consistency of the existing national risk rating systems : the Commission will establish a uniform formula for calculating the risk rating of transport undertakings, and take into account certain criteria, such as the use of the 'smart' tachygraph. Data in the risk rating system must be made available to control authorities. Posting of workers : the Commission proposes that drivers are considered as posted workers if they spend at least 3 days in a given calendar month on the territory of a Member State. All cabotage operations will be considered as posting of workers from day 1 – regardless of their duration. The minimum rate of pay and the minimum annual paid holidays of the host Member State should apply to cabotage irrespective of the frequency and duration of the operations carried out by a driver. For the purposes of the calculation of the periods of posting: a daily working period shorter than six hours spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as half a day; a daily working period of six hours or more spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as a full day; breaks and rest periods as well as periods of availability spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as working period. The proposal lays down the specific administrative requirements and control measures for checking compliance with the provisions on posting of workers in road transport."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this imperative by stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed by an Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: for the sake of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy. The new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Objective : the proposed Regulation provides for a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with the objective of: organising operational coordination of fisheries control and inspection activities by the Member States; assisting Member States to cooperate so as to comply with the rules of the common fisheries policy in order to ensure its effective and uniform application. The Agency's mission shall be to: coordinate : (i) controls and inspections of fisheries by EU countries; (ii) the deployment of national means of control and inspection pooled by EU countries; (iii) operations to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; assist Member States in (i) providing the European Commission and other interested parties with information on fishing activities and control and inspection activities; (ii) fulfilling their obligations under fisheries policy rules; assist Member States and the Commission in harmonising the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy throughout the Union; contribute to the research and development work carried out by the Member States and the Commission on control and inspection techniques; (ii) coordinate the training of inspectors and the sharing of experience between the Member States; (iii) contribute to the harmonised implementation of the control system of the common fisheries policy; cooperate with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency, each within its own mandate, to support national authorities carrying out coast guard functions, by providing services, information, equipment and training, as well as coordinating multi-purpose operations. The Agency shall, at the Commission's request: assist the Union and Member States in their relations with third countries and regional international fisheries organisations of which the Union is a member; cooperate with the competent authorities of regional international fisheries organisations regarding the control and inspection obligations of the Union in the framework of working arrangements concluded with such bodies. The Agency shall coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in accordance with joint deployment plans, which organise the use of the available means of control and inspection of the Member States concerned so as to give effect to control and inspection programmes. Fisheries control and inspection activities undertaken by the Member States should be carried out in accordance with common criteria, priorities, benchmarks and procedures regarding control and inspection activities on the basis of such programmes. Organisation : the Agency, based in Vigo, Spain, shall consist of: (i) an Executive Director appointed for a five-year term; (ii) an Advisory Board to assist the Executive Director; and (iii) an Administrative Board (composed of one representative from each EU country and six Commission representatives) which, inter alia, appoints the Executive Director."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: mercury is recognised as a global threat to human health and the environment. Mercury is characterised by its transboundary nature. Global action is therefore necessary to ensure the protection of the individuals and of the environment within the Union as a complement to domestic measures. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to control and limit the use and anthropogenic emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land. The Convention was adopted and opened for signature at a Conference of the Plenipotentiaries in Kumamoto, Japan, in October 2013. The European Union and twenty-one Member States signed the Convention on 10 October 2013 while Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia and Poland did so on 24 September 2014 and Malta on 8 October 2014. The EU has made significant progress for the last 10 years in addressing mercury domestically as a follow-up to the adoption in 2005 of the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury, as supported by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament in its resolution dated 14.3. 2006. The Strategy was reviewed in 2010 and was supported by the Council of the European Union. The Seventh Environmental Action programme established the long-term objective of a non-toxic environment and stated, for that purpose, that action is needed to ensure the minimisation of significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020. CONTENT: with the present draft Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The Convention addresses the whole life-cycle of mercury with the objective to protect human health and the environment. It: In parallel to this proposed Decision, the Commission has put forward a proposal for a Regulation by the European Parliament and the Council to transpose the limited number of provisions of the Convention that are not yet implemented into EU legislation."
2012EP8,"""""EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL)""""",0.6,0.828,0.88,0.146,0.115,0.851,0.859,0.058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European Union agency for law enforcement training (Cepol), repealing and replacing the Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 543/2014 amending Council Decision 2005/681/JHA, which entered into force on 29 May 2014 transferred the seat of CEPOL from Bramshill in the United Kingdom to Budapest in Hungary. On 27 March 2013, the Commission made a proposal for a Regulation updating the legal framework of the European Police Office (Europol). This proposal pursued several aims, one of which being merging CEPOL with Europol to create synergies between operational law enforcement work and training activities. The European Parliament and the Council did not agree to the proposed merger of CEPOL with Europol. Instead, a regulation moving the seat of CEPOL as an independent agency to Budapest, Hungary, was adopted on 6 May 2014. Due to the opposition to the proposed merger, other parts of the Europol proposal relating to training were not discussed by the European Parliament and the Council in detail. This proposal for a Regulation draws – except as regards the question of merging CEPOL with Europol which has since been decided by the co-legislators – on preparatory work carried out in 2011 and 2012 by the Commission on the modernisation of CEPOL's legal basis. It therefore provides for a legal framework for a new CEPOL with broader objectives and modernised governance, which repeals and replaces CEPOL as established by Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted two impact assessments of policy alternatives concerning Europol and CEPOL. The impact assessment on CEPOL was based on the two policy objectives of: (i) ensuring better quality, more joined-up and more consistent training for a wider range of law enforcement officers in cross-border crime issues; (ii) establishing a framework to achieve this in line with the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies. The analysis of the overall impact led, in the context of the Europol Regulation proposal, to a preferred policy option which was the merger of CEPOL into Europol. However, given that the European Parliament and the Council did not agree to the proposed merger in May 2014, this proposal for a regulation accordingly maintains CEPOL as an independent agency, with its seat in Budapest. Any other option would, at this point in time, generate additional costs and create uncertainty for the Agency's future and its staff which would adversely affect its ability to deliver on its objectives. CONTENT: this proposal aims to: give CEPOL the appropriate legal mandate and the necessary resources to implement the training effort set out in the Commission Communication on European Law Enforcement Training Scheme; improve the governance of CEPOL by seeking increased efficiency and aligning it with the principles laid down in the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies. (1) Implementation of a European approach to training : in line with the principles laid down in the Commission communication on the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS), the scope of CEPOL’s mandate is broadened so that it can support, develop, deliver and coordinate learning activities for law enforcement officials of all ranks (not only police officers of senior rank as is the case under the current CEPOL Decision ) as well as to officers of customs and of other relevant services dealing with cross-border issues. The proposal envisages that the Agency will remain network-based, bringing together the network of training institutes of the Member States for the law enforcement officials and liaising with a single National unit in each Member State. The objectives of CEPOL are updated and clarified so that the Agency may: improve awareness and knowledge of international and Union instruments, the institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union; encourage the development of the regional or bilateral cooperation among the Member States; address specific criminal or policing thematic areas where training at EU level can add value in addition to the national level; provide appropriate and preliminary training sessions for the participation in civilian missions in third Countries. (2) Improved governance : the proposal improves the governance of CEPOL by streamlining procedures, notably with respect to the Management Board and the Executive Director, and by aligning CEPOL with the principles laid down in the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies, keeping in mind that CEPOL, as a centre of EU learning activities, should continue to rely on the network of the training institutes of the Member States and liaise with a single National unit in each Member State. The Commission and the Member States are represented on the Management Board of CEPOL. Appointment procedure : in line with the mandate of the Agency, the members of the Management Board are appointed on the basis of their knowledge of training for law enforcement officers, taking into account relevant managerial, administrative and budgetary skills. The Management Board will be advised by a scientific committee on technical training issues (Scientific Committee for Training). Management Board tasks : the Management Board is given the necessary powers, in particular to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules and planning documents, establish transparent working procedures for decision-making by the Executive Director of CEPOL, adopt the annual activity report, and appoint an Executive Director. In order to ensure efficient day-to-day functioning of CEPOL, the Executive Director is its legal representative and manager. The Executive Director is completely independent in the performance of his/her tasks and ensures that CEPOL carries out the tasks foreseen in this Regulation. In particular, the Executive Director is responsible for preparing budgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the Management Board. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the adoption of this Regulation will have no additional financial implication. An estimated EUR 6.092 million of staff costs (excl. schooling fees) will be saved over the period 2016-2020 as a result of the relocation from Bramshill to Budapest and the difference in the correction coefficient between the United Kingdom and Hungary. Schooling fees for children of CEPOL’s staff will constitute an additional cost of EUR 1.868 million over the same period. An estimated EUR 0.658 million will be saved as a result of lower costs of building, equipment and management board expenses over the same period. The relocation of around 40 staff from CEPOL’s current site in Bramshill, United Kingdom, to the new site in Budapest, Hungary, will have taken place before this proposal for a Regulation enters into force. In total, therefore, the budgetary impact of the legislative proposal amounts to EUR 45.383 million for CEPOL, as an independent Agency established in Budapest, over the period 2016-2020."

BACKGROUND: in order to simplify the legislative structure and ensure clarity of the applicable provisions in the field of cohesion, the common provisions regulation (CPR) lays down common rules and specific rules for the Funds. So goes for the Regulation covering both the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund intervening under ‘Investment for jobs and growth’ and, for the ERDF, under the ‘European territorial cooperation’ goal (Interreg). As part of a major simplification effort, the Commission now proposes to adopt specific provisions in relation to the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) where one or more Member States cooperate across borders with regard to effective programming. The Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) actively promotes territorial cooperation. The 13 ENPI (European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument) CBC programmes implemented during the 2007-2013 period covered nine EU land borders, three sea basins and one sea crossing. The programmes involved 34 countries, 19 EU Member States and 12 of the 16 neighbourhood partner countries plus Norway, Russia and Turkey CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) with a view to fostering cooperation between Member States inside the Union and between Member States and adjacent third countries, partner countries, other territories or overseas countries and territories (OCTs) respectively. · With regard to support from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III), the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and the funding for all the OCTs for the period 2021 to 2027, the proposal defines additional specific objectives as well as the integration of those funds into Interreg programmes, the criteria for third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions to be eligible and certain specific implementation rules. · With regard to support from the ERDF and the external financing instruments of the Union (the Interreg funds) to Interreg programmes, this proposed Regulation defines the Interreg-specific objectives as well as the organisation, the criteria for Member States, third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions to be eligible, the financial resources, and the criteria for their allocation. European territorial cooperation (Interreg) objective strands : support shall be provided by the ERDF and, where appropriate, by the Union's external financing instruments for the following five components: (i) cross-border; (ii) transnational and maritime; (iii) outermost regions; (iv) interregional cooperation and; (v) the new interregional innovation investments. Geographical coverage : the cross-border cooperation component shall focus on NUTS level 3 regions of the Union along all internal and external land borders with third countries or partner countries, while cross-border cooperation along maritime borders shall be integrated into the broader ‘transnational and maritime cooperation’ component. The Commission stresses that access to public services such as hospitals and universities is generally more difficult in border regions. Moreover, navigating between different administrative and legal systems is still often complex and costly. The proposal therefore aims to help cross-border cooperation programmes to focus on institutional cooperation, solving border problems and investment in common services of public interest. Transnational cooperation shall cover larger territories on the mainland of the Union, whereas maritime cooperation shall cover territories around sea-basins and integrate cross-border cooperation on maritime borders during the programming period 2014-2020. A specific outermost regions’ component shall be established in order to enable outermost regions to cooperate with their neighbouring countries and territories in the most effective and simple way. The list of Interreg programmes to receive financial support shall be set out in an implementing act adopted by the European Commission. Specific objectives : taking into account the special features of Interreg, two Interreg-specific objectives are set out: (i) 'better Interreg governance'; and (ii) 'a safer and more secure Europe', The proposed Regulation also sets out specific percentages for thematic concentration. Programming, monitoring, eligibility : the proposal: (i) clarifies the rules governing funds for small projects that offer real added value and play an important role in building trust between citizens and institutions; (ii) ensures consistent monitoring of performance by refining the common set of performance indicators; (iii) establishes a clear hierarchy between the EU eligibility rules, the specific rules for Interreg programmes and, finally, the national eligibility rules. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The ERDF resources for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) shall amount to EUR 8.43 billion of the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the ERDF, ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund for the 2021-2027 programming period. The resources shall be allocated as follows: 52.7% (EUR 4.44 billion in total) for cross-border cooperation (component 1); 31.4% (EUR 2.65 billion in total) for transnational cooperation and maritime cooperation (component 2); 3.2% (EUR 270.1 million in total) for outermost regions’ cooperation (component 3); 1.2% (EUR 100 million in total) for interregional cooperation (component 4); 11.5 % (a total of EUR 970 million) for interregional innovation investments (component 5)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: on the basis of a mandate from the Council, the Commission has conducted negotiations with Morocco on the renewal for one year of the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Morocco, which expired on 27 February 2011. A Protocol renewing the preceding Protocol was initialled on 25 February 2011. It is now appropriate to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The Commission’s negotiating position was based in part on the results of an ex-post and ex-ante evaluation carried out by independent experts, as well as on a joint assessment of the scientific data on the state of stocks. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) in conjunction with Article 218(6a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal aims to extend, for the period of one year, the protocol to the fisheries partnership agreement between the EC and Morocco of 22 May 2006. The general aim is to continue the cooperation between the European Union and Morocco, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Moroccan fishing zones, in the interests of both Parties. The main objective of the Protocol is to define the fishing opportunities offered to EU vessels based on the surplus available, as well as the financial contribution due, separately, for access rights and for sectoral support. The main provisions may be summarised as follows : Financial contribution : the overall annual contribution of EUR 36 100 000 under the Protocol is based on: a maximum of 119 fishing permits for EU vessels in the categories of small-scale fishing, demersal fishing and tuna fishing, as well as a maximum catch tonnage of 60 000 tonnes in the category of industrial pelagic fishing, and EUR 13 500 000 in development aid for Morocco's sectoral fisheries policy. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy. Fishing opportunities : the Protocol – like its predecessor – provides for fishing opportunities in the following six categories: small-scale pelagic fishing in the north: 20 seiners; small-scale fishing in the north: 30 bottom longliners; small-scale fishing in the south: 20 vessels; demersal fishing: 22 vessels; tuna fishing: 27 vessels; industrial pelagic fishing: 60 000 tonnes of catches. Duration of the agreement : the Protocol will be valid from 28 February 2011 to 27 February 2012. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial envelope for the Protocol is EUR 36.15 million for the extended year (including credits of an administrative nature financed by certain operational programmes.) A total of EUR 142.000 is provided for administrative expenditure. The total amounts to EUR 36.292 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission adopted on October 6th 2011 a proposal for a ""Common Provisions"" Regulation which lays down common rules for the shared-management funds, with the main aim of simplification of policy delivery. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (CSF Funds) pursue complementary objectives and share the same management mode. The ""Common Provisions"" Regulation sets out a series of common rules for these funds. The Commission proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020 adopted on 29 June 2011 set the budgetary framework and main orientations for the funding of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). This proposal for the Regulation on European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) aims at achieving the objectives of the reformed CFP and of IMP. It is based on these objectives, re-defined in terms of funding: §  promotion of sustainable and competitive fisheries and aquaculture; §  fostering the development and implementation of the Union's Integrated Maritime Policy, in a complementary manner to cohesion policy and to CFP; §  promotion of balanced and inclusive territorial development of fisheries areas (including aquaculture and inland fishing); §  contribution to the implementation of the CFP. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: on the basis of the FIFG ex-post evaluation, the interim evaluation of the EFF and the impact assessment for the CFP reform, the impact assessment of the EMFF assesses three alternative scenarios: the ""EFF+"", which is a continuation of the current EFF without most of the direct fleet subsidies and the support focused on the objectives of the CFP reform; the ""EFF+ integration "", in which the other CFP funding instruments are integrated into a post EFF fund, but keep the same management mode as today and the ""EFF+ convergence"" in which support to IMP is also integrated under the new single fund and all the instruments are brought to the extent possible under the shared management. The impact assessment concluded that the ""EFF+ Convergence"" performs better than the two other options on the three impact indicators chosen for the analysis: (i) the reduction of the impact of fisheries on the environment; (ii) the closure of the innovation gap in fisheries and aquaculture and (iii) the number of jobs created in communities dependent on fisheries. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that most of the current CFP and IMP financial instruments be integrated into one fund, with the exception of Sustainable Fisheries Agreements (SFAs) and the compulsory contribution to RFMOs. EMFF focuses on CFP and IMP long-term strategic objectives including sustainable and competitive fisheries and aquaculture, consistent policy framework for the further development of IMP and balanced and inclusive territorial development of fisheries areas. The EMFF is structured around 4 pillars: §  Smart, green Fisheries (shared management) to foster the transition to sustainable fishing which is more selective, produces no discards, does less damage to marine ecosystems and thus contributes to the sustainable management of marine ecosystems; and to provide support focused on innovation and value added, making the fisheries sector economically viable and resilient to external shocks and to competition from third countries. §  Smart, green Aquaculture (shared management) - to achieve economically viable, competitive and green aquaculture, capable of facing global competition and providing EU consumers with healthy and high nutrition value products. §  Sustainable and inclusive territorial development (shared management) - to reverse the decline of many coastal and inland communities dependent on fishing, through adding more value to fishing and fishing related activities and through diversification to other sectors of the maritime economy. §  Integrated Maritime Policy (direct centralised management) to support those cross cutting priorities which generate savings and growth but which the Member States will not take forward on their own – such as marine knowledge, maritime spatial planning, integrated coastal zone management and integrated maritime surveillance, the protection of the marine environment, in particular its biodiversity, and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change on coastal areas. In addition to the four pillars, the EMFF will include accompanying measures: data collection and scientific advice, control, governance, fisheries markets (including outermost regions), voluntary payments to RFMOs and technical assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the envelope for 2014-2020, in current prices, is set at EUR 7,535 billion, including SFAs and the compulsory contributions to RFMOs, which will be funded separately. The EMFF budget amounts, in current prices to EUR 6567 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy is one of the main strategic objectives of the Union. On 12 December 2019, the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. The proposed Regulation implements one of the priorities set out in the Communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal and is part of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which provides for specific funding under the Just Transition Mechanism in the context of cohesion policy. The Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) shall provide targeted support to the regions and sectors most affected by transition due to their dependence on fossil fuels or industrial processes that are high emitters of greenhouse gases, to help them mobilise at least EUR 100 billion over the period 2021-2027 and thus mitigate the socio-economic impact of transition. The JTM shall be additional to the contribution made by the EU budget through all instruments directly related to the transition, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund plus (ESF+). It shall have three main sources of funding: (1) a Just Transition Fund, (2) a dedicated scheme under InvestEU and (3) a Public Sector Loan Facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims at establishing the Just Transition Fund (JTF), which is one of the pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism implemented under cohesion policy. Subject matter The aim of the JTF is to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned. In line with the JTF specific objective, actions supported by the JTF should directly contribute to alleviate the impact of the transition by financing the diversification and modernisation of the local economy and by mitigating the negative repercussions on employment. Programming The programming process, including the identification of the territories for intervention and corresponding actions will be agreed in a dialogue between the Commission and each Member State. It will be steered by the European Semester process. Taking into account the Commission’s analysis, Member States shall prepare one or more territorial just transition plans, providing an outline of the transition process until 2030, consistent with the National Energy and Climate Plans and the transition to a climate neutral economy and identifying subsequently the most impacted territories that should be supported. The proposal also establishes a framework for measuring the achievements of the JTF using the relevant indicators and a mechanism for adjusting support if the targets are not met. Scope of support The Fund would essentially provide grants to the regions. The projects funded should contribute to a transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy. The Fund would support, inter alia, the following activities: - productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; - investments in research and innovation activities and in fostering the transfer of advanced technologies; - investments in the deployment of affordable clean energy technologies and infrastructure, in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energies; - investments in strengthening the circular economy, including through waste prevention and reduction, resource efficiency, reuse, repair and recycling; - the up-skilling and reskilling of the affected workers, with the aim of helping them to adapt to new employment opportunities, as well as providing jobsearch assistance to jobseekers and their active inclusion into the labour market. Budget The Fund shall be endowed with EUR 7.5 billion (at 2018 prices) for the period 2021-2027 in addition to what the Commission has proposed for the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). It shall support the ""Investment for jobs and growth"" objective of the new regulation on common provisions (CPR) in all Member States. Member States will complement their Just Transition Fund allocation from their resources under the ERDF and the ESF+ through a specific and definitive transfer mechanism. Member States will also provide national resources to complement the Union resources. The level of Union co-financing will be set according to the category of region in which the identified territories are located. The overall financing capacity of this fund will exceed EUR 30 billion and may reach EUR 50 billion."
5991EP7,"""""Occurrence reporting in civil aviation""""",0.807,0.875,0.912,0.613,0.515,0.88,0.867,0.829,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down common rules in the field of occurrence reporting in civil aviation in order to correct safety deficiencies and prevent them from recurring. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the average annual rate of fatal accidents in scheduled passenger operations in the EU has remained more or less stable for the past years. However, it is feared that with the air traffic growth forecast for the next decades there will be an increase in the number of accidents. Experience has shown that often before an accident occurs, a number of incidents and numerous other deficiencies have shown the existence of safety hazards. Whilst the ability to learn lessons from an accident is crucial, purely reactive systems have shown their limit in continuing to bring forward improvements. In this context, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has encouraged the transition towards a more proactive and evidence-based safety approach. At Union level, Directive 2003/42/EC established the basis for a proactive and evidence-based aviation safety management system in the European Union by imposing the reporting of occurrences. However, the European Union and its Member States are currently not sufficiently able to use experience feedback for preventing accidents and the current legislation is insufficient to prevent that the number of accidents and related fatalities would increase as a consequence of the expected traffic growth. The improvement of civil aviation safety requires that relevant civil aviation safety information should be reported, collected, stored, protected, exchanged, disseminated, analysed and that appropriate safety actions should be taken on the basis of the information collected. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the option of not introducing any change to the current situation, three policy packages were considered to assess how Directive 2003/42/EC could be revised. · Policy package 1 aims at improving the current system through amendment to the legislation limited to what is strictly necessary and to the adoption of recommendations and guidance wherever possible; · Policy package 2 consists of a more ambitious package of policy measures entailing a substantial revision of EU legislation on occurrence reporting; · Policy package 3 aims at improving the current system by transferring Member States occurrence reporting competencies to the EU level and establishing requirements for occurrence analysis together with the adoption of necessary safety actions and improvement in monitoring. On the basis of the efficiency, effectiveness and consistency criteria, it is recommended that policy package 2 should be implemented, as its benefits would be considerably higher than the costs incurred. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to contribute to the reduction of the number of aircraft accidents and related fatalities, through the improvement of existing systems, both at national and European level, using civil aviation occurrences for correcting safety deficiencies and prevent them from recurring. The main points of the proposal are as follows: 1) Better collection of occurrences : the proposal establishes the appropriate framework for ensuring that all occurrences that endanger or would endanger aviation safety are reported. The proposal: · maintains the obligation to establish mandatory occurrence reporting systems (MORS) and lists the persons obliged to report, as well as the occurrences to be reported under the MORS; · imposes the establishment of voluntary systems whose aim is to collect occurrences which have not been captured by the MORS; · contains provisions ensuring that aviation professionals are encouraged to report safety-related information by protecting them from punishment, except in cases of gross negligence. 2) Clarification of the flow of information : the proposal requires organisations and Member States to establish occurrence reporting systems which will enable the identification of safety hazards. The occurrences collected by organisations must be transmitted to Member States’ competent authorities or to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), when appropriate. All occurrences collected by Member States, organisations and EASA are aggregated into the European Central Repository. 3) Improved quality and completeness of data : in order to ensure better identification of key risk areas and of measures to be taken, occurrence reports will have to contain minimum information and mandatory data fields, such as the date of the occurrence, the occurrence category or the narrative of the occurrence, will be introduced. The proposal also includes: · the obligation to classify occurrences in terms of risk according to a European common risk classification scheme; · procedures for implementing data quality checks , notably to ensure consistency between an occurrence report and the initial information collected from the reporter. The Commission will support Member States in reaching higher data quality and completeness standards by supporting the development of guidance material and the use of workshops. 4) Better exchange of information : access by Member States and EASA to the European Central Repository, which contains all occurrences collected by Member States as well as by EASA, is extended to all data and information contained in the database. In addition, when, in the assessment of data collected through occurrence reporting systems, an authority identifies safety matters considered to be of interest for another authority, it shall forward the information in a timely manner. In order to facilitate the exchange of data and information, the text requires that all occurrence reports should be compatible with the ECCAIRS software (this software is used by all Member States and for the European Central Repository) and with the ADREP taxonomy (the ICAO taxonomy also used in the ECCAIRS software). 5) Better protection against inappropriate use of safety information : the proposal strengthens the rules on ensuring that, besides the obligation to guarantee the confidentiality of the data collected, such information can only be made available and used for the purpose of maintaining or improving aviation safety. 6) Better protection of reporter to ensure the continued availability of information : the text reaffirms the obligation to render anonymous occurrence reports and it limits access to fully identified data only to certain persons. In addition, Member States are asked to refrain from instituting proceedings except in cases of gross negligence. Organisations are also asked to adopt a policy describing how the employees' protection is guaranteed. National bodies must be established, allowing employees to report infringements to the rules which guarantee their protection and penalties should be adopted, where appropriate. 7) Introduction of requirements on information analysis and follow up actions at national level : the proposal imposes new requirements which transpose into EU law the rules related to analysis and follow up of occurrences collected, which have been agreed at international level. Organisations and Member States are required to analyse the information collected through occurrence reporting systems in order to identify safety risks and to take actions in order to remedy to any safety deficiency identified. 8) Strengthen analysis at EU level : analysis at EU level will complement what is done at national level notably by the identification of possible safety problems and key risk areas at European level. 9) Improved transparency towards the general public : the proposal provides for the publication of annual safety reviews containing information about actions taken in application of the regulation, trends and aggregated data. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this is related to additional human resources for the European Aviation Safety Agency (involved through the Network of Analysts) and additional budget for mission and outreach activities. Both additional human resources (2 posts estimated at EUR 300 000 per year) and additional budget (mission and outreach activities estimated at EUR 65 000 per year) will be fully covered by redeployment within the existing resources of the Agency. Therefore the impact on the EU budget is neutral. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Georgia continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The EU-Georgia Association Agreement, which includes the gradual introduction of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), was signed in June 2014 and entered into force on 1 July 2016. Georgia continues to face a weak external environment, which, through reduced exports and remittances, has contributed to the relatively subdued GDP growth of 2.7% in 2016 (compared to 2.9% in 2015 and 4.6% in 2014). Georgia’s fiscal deficit remains significant and its public debt-to-GDP ratio has increased. Georgia’s balance of payments position remains vulnerable due to a very large current account deficit and high external debt. In this context, the Georgian authorities and the IMF agreed, in April 2017, on a three-year (2017-2020) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement in the amount of USD 285.3 million. The aim of the EFF arrangement is to support an economic reform programme which will help Georgia reduce economic vulnerabilities, and promote higher and more inclusive economic growth. In view of Georgia’s residual external financing needs, the Georgian authorities requested complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union in June 2017. The proposed new MFA operation is the third one after Georgia’s military conflict with Russia in August 2008. The first of those operations (EUR 46 million, fully in the form of grants) was implemented in 2009-2010 and the second (again EUR 46 million, half in grants and half loans) in 2015-2017. The EU’s macro-financial assistance is an exceptional emergency instrument aimed at addressing severe balance-of-payment difficulties in third countries. Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in Georgia’s balance of payments over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Georgia is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Georgia’s request for support to the economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. CONTENT: the proposed new MFA operation under consideration would amount to a maximum of EUR 45 million. It will help Georgia cover part of the external financing needs for the period of 2017-2020, which are estimated at USD 752 million. The operation will reduce the economy’s short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities. It will be designed and implemented in coordination with the adjustment and reform programmes Georgia has agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as with the reforms agreed in the context of the EU’s budget support operations and the DCFTA. The Commission proposes to provide the amount of the assistance in the form of medium-term loans of up to EUR 35 million and grants of up to EUR 10 million. The Commission is considering releasing the assistance in two instalments. Disbursements would be conditional on successful reviews under the IMF programme and on the effective drawing by Georgia on IMF funds. The Commission and the Georgian authorities would agree on a specific set of structural reform measures, to be defined in a Memorandum of Understanding. These reform measures would support the authorities’ reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank. A pre-condition for granting the Union’s macro-financial assistance shall be that Georgia respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union’s macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems in Georgia. Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service The Commission should also regularly inform the Council and the Parliament about developments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: assistance shall be provided in the form of a loan and grants. The loan part will be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. Assuming that the two loan disbursements (of EUR 15 million for the first tranche and EUR 20 million for the second tranche) will be made in 2018, the provisioning will take place in the 2020 budget, in accordance with the rules governing the Guarantee Fund mechanism, for an amount of EUR 3.15 million. The grant element of the assistance (EUR 10 million in total, i.e. EUR 5 million for each of the two tranches) will be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2018 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macro-financial assistance), with payments also taking place in 2018."
2148EP7,"""""Dual-use items and technology""""",0.825,0.883,0.0,0.613,0.364,0.964,0.862,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to achieve uniform and consistent application of controls of exports of dual-use items and technology throughout the Community in order to avoid unfair competition among Community exporters and ensure efficiency of the security controls in the Community. PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology requires dual-use items (including software and technology) to be subject to effective control when they are exported from the Community. Dual-use items (including software and technology) are civil items which can be used for military purposes. They are subject to control when they are to be exported from the European Union. These controls are designed in particular to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that such control is fully effective and complies with Member States' commitments at multilateral level, authorisation is required under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 for export of the dual-use items listed in Annex I. There are four types of export authorisations: 1) Community General Export Authorisation (CGEA) No EU001, as referred to in Article 6 of Regulation 1334/2000, covers most of the exports of controlled items to seven countries (United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway); 2) for all other exports for which an authorisation is required under the Regulation, it leaves to the national authorities the final decision as to whether to grant a national general, global or individual export licence. National general export authorisations are created by individual EU Member States and are valid in principle across the EU. However, in spite of the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000, there is a lack of transparency across Member States regarding both the scope and conditions of use of national general export authorisations and the list of exporters denied access to national general export authorisations. As a result, the chances of infringement of the Regulation are significant. This leads to regulatory treatment of certain exports that benefits businesses established in one Member State at least partly at the expense of businesses established in and national security interests of other Member States, and is not in the best interests of the Community as a whole. In its Communication of 18 December 2006, the Commission put forward the idea of the creation of new Community General Export Authorisations in a bid to simplify the current legal system, enhance the industry’s competitiveness and establish a level playing field for all Community exporters when they export certain items to certain destinations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this initiative does not create new administrative burdens for companies. The objective is to provide exporters with a more comprehensive instrument than national authorisations — valid throughout the European Union. Even if it impossible to measure the exact impact, it is clear that the initiative will have a positive operational impact on exporters, that there will be no negative impact at EU level and that this narrow legislative initiative would have no far-reaching economic, social or environmental impact beyond the dual-use goods regime. LEGAL BASIS: please refer to the summary entitled “background note”. CONTENT: in order to create new Community General Export Authorisations for certain non-sensitive dual-use items to certain non-sensitive countries, the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 need to be amended by the addition of six new Annexes. The draft proposal covers six new CGEAs. Compared to the preferences expressed by the Working Party sub-group on new CGEAs, this proposal has added a number of countries and items and made a number of changes to the conditions of use of the authorisations. In addition, the draft Regulation states that the competent authorities of the Member State where the exporter is established should be provided with the possibility of not permitting the use of the Community General Export Authorisations foreseen in this Regulation where the exporter has been sanctioned of an export-related offence punishable by the withdrawal of the right to use these authorisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication on the EU budget."
7717EP8,"""""Third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement""""",0.7,0.833,0.94,0.979,0.269,0.985,0.885,0.673,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to codify Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/20016 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. In the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The new regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed regulation establishes visa requirements and visa exemptions for third-country nationals entering the EU for a short stay. Common lists: the proposal for a regulation lists third countries whose nationals must have a visa to cross the external borders of a Member State (Annex I to the Regulation). It also lists the countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement for stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period (Annex II of the Regulation). Determination of third countries whose nationals are subject to or exempt from the visa requirement is made on the basis of a case-by-case assessment of various criteria, relating inter alia to: illegal immigration, public policy and security; economic benefit, in particular in terms of tourism and foreign trade ; the Union's external relations with the relevant third countries, including, in particular, considerations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. This assessment should be periodic and may lead to legislative proposals to amend the lists in Annexes I and II to the Regulation. Exceptions and exemptions : Member States may grant exceptions to the visa requirement as regards certain categories of persons, e.g. holders of diplomatic passports, service or official passports or special passports, civilian air or sea crewmembers or crew and members of emergency or rescue missions. The following persons may be exempted from the visa requirement: a school pupil having the nationality of a third country listed in Annex I who resides in a third country listed in Annex II or in Switzerland and Liechtenstein and who is travelling in the context of a school excursion as a member of a group of school pupils accompanied by a teacher from the school in question; recognised refugees and stateless persons if the third country where they reside and which issued their travel document is one of the third countries listed in Annex II; Reciprocity mechanism : the Regulation provides for a Union mechanism allowing the implementation of the principle of reciprocity if one of the third countries included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement decides to make the nationals of one or more Member States subject to the visa obligation. That mechanism should provide for a Union response as an act of solidarity, if such a third country applies a visa requirement for nationals of at least one Member State. Suspension mechanism : the proposal also provides for a mechanism for the temporary suspension of the exemption from the visa requirement for a third country included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement in an emergency situation, where an urgent response is needed in order to resolve the difficulties faced by at least one Member State, and taking account of the overall impact of the emergency situation on the Union as a whole. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to ensure the proper participation of the European Parliament and the Council in respect of certain elements of the reciprocity and suspension mechanisms."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. It is applied by all Member States with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries. The first series of visa waiver agreements were signed on 6 May 2015 (United Arab Emirates), 26 May 2015 (Timor-Leste) and 28 May 2015 (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu) and provisionally apply from the date of signature pending their entry into force. The Council has authorised the signature of a second series of visa waiver agreements with Tonga (signed on 20 November 2015), Colombia (signed on 2 December 2015), Kiribati (date of signature to be determined) and Palau (signed on 7 December 2015). These four agreements provisionally apply from the day following the date of signature pending their entry into force. The negotiations with Micronesia were opened on 17 December 2014. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 16 December 2015 (Micronesia) and 13 January 2016 (Union). The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Federated States of Micronesia on the short-stay visa waiver. The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Micronesia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Micronesia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Micronesia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For those travelling to carry out a paid activity, each Member State and also Micronesia remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. A joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Micronesia to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. A joint declaration on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis is annexed to the agreement. Lastly, the Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement."
2867EP7,"""""Export and import of dangerous chemicals""""",0.667,0.762,0.825,0.581,0.333,0.747,0.774,0.8,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: recast of provisions currently in force regarding the import and export of dangerous chemicals. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) n° 689/2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals implements the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade. The Rotterdam Convention was adopted in September 1998. It entered into force on 24 February 2004. Its aim is to promote shared responsibility and co-operative efforts among the Parties in the international trade of dangerous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use. Regulation (EC) n° 689/2008 go beyond those of the Convention and offer more protection to importing countries since they are addressed to all countries and not just Parties to the Convention. The scope of the Regulation is not limited to chemicals that are banned or severely restricted under the Convention but also covers chemicals that are banned or severely restricted at EU level. In addition the Regulation ensures that all chemicals are appropriately packed and labelled when exported.  It is now necessary to align Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) 1907/2006.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT: as the overall impact of the review is expected to be limited, it was not considered imperative to carry out an impact assessment. The main effects of the changes can be summarised as follows: there will be more clarity, transparency and increased legal certainty for all parties involved in the implementation of the  Regulation;  the proposal will not add any additional administrative burden for exporters or the competent authorities involved in the implementation of the Regulation. On the contrary, with respect to exports that are exempted from export notification the proposed amendments will lead to a reduction of administrative burdens;  some tasks will be transferred from the Commission to the European Chemicals Agency, which is expected to reduce the overall costs and to increase the scientific knowledge available for implementation;  the current high level of protection of human health and the environment will be maintained. LEGAL BASIS: in line with the judgment of the Court in case C-178/03 ( Commission v Parliament and Council ), the proposed Regulation will be based on Article 192(1) (relating to Environmental Protection) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union and Article 207 (relating to the Common Commercial Policy).  CONTENT: the proposed new Regulation would essentially maintain all provisions of the current Regulation, including those that go beyond the requirements of the Convention. However, certain technical amendments are deemed necessary to improve the clarity and functioning of the Regulation. The main changes are as follows: Definitions : bearing in mind Regulation 1272/2008 and the experience gained from the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, the proposal makes certain technical amendments to the operative provisions such as clarify the definitions of a substance, a mixture and an article, and the reference identification number required for exports that are not subject to export notification.– Explicit consent procedure : in around 30% of the cases to date, despite the efforts made by the designated national authorities (DNAs) of the exporting Member States and the Commission to obtain explicit consent, no response is forthcoming from the importing country, in some cases for many months or even years. As a result, exports cannot proceed, despite the fact that the substances are often not banned or severely restricted in the importing countries. The proposal makes provision for additional conditions that may allow exports to proceed in the absence of a reply from the importing country whilst not lowering the protection afforded to importing countries. It is proposed to allow the export to proceed if there is documentary evidence from official sources showing that the chemical has been imported or used in the last 5 years and no regulatory action has been taken, if, despite all reasonable efforts by the exporter’s DNA, the Agency and the Commission, there is no response from the importing country within 2 months. Involvement of the European Chemicals Agency : in order to support the Commission in its tasks as a common designated authority foreseen under the Regulation, it is proposed to involve the European Chemicals Agency in certain administrative, technical and scientific tasks necessary for the implementation of the Regulation, in particular regarding the management of the European Database on Export and Import of dangerous chemicals. Adaptation of provisions to the Lisbon Treaty: in view of the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, it is necessary to clarify provisions relating to the external representation of the European Union and to adapt the provisions concerning comitology. In particular, it should be specified which rules are subject to implementing acts and clarified which conditions apply to the adoption of delegated acts. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is not expected to have important budgetary implications since no new tasks were introduced compared to Regulation (EC) 689/2008. The transfer of certain tasks from the Commission to the European Chemicals Agency is expected to reduce the overall costs of implementation. Further reductions may be achieved in a long-term perspective considering the potential for synergies with other tasks of the Agency. The financing of the tasks carried out by the European Chemicals Agency will be provided in form of a subsidy from the Union budget.  DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains certain provisions conferring on the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the Schengen acquis, third country nationals lawfully residing in the Union and third country nationals who have legally entered the territory of a Member State may move freely within the territories of all other Member States during a period of 90 days in any 180-day period. On 14 June 2021, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/953 establishing the EU Digital COVID Certificate. That Regulation sets out a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates for COVID-19 vaccination, test or recovery certificates to facilitate free movement of EU citizens and their family members during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulation (EU) 2021/953 is accompanied by Regulation (EU) 2021/954 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which extends the EU Digital COVID Certificate framework to third-country nationals who are legally staying or residing in a Member State’s territory and who are entitled to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. Regulations (EU) 2021/953 and (EU) 2021/954 are due to expire on 30 June 2022. Nevertheless, the pandemic is still on-going and the recent outbreak of the ‘Omicron’ variant of concern continues to negatively impact travel within the Union. Consequently, the EU Digital COVID Certificate remains relevant and it is necessary to allow for its continued use. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission is proposing to extend, by 12 months (until 30 June 2023), the application of Regulation (EU) 2021/954, which lays down a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable COVID-19 vaccination, test and recovery certificates (EU Digital COVID Certificate) to certain categories of third country nationals lawfully residing or staying in the Union. The proposed Regulation should not be understood as facilitating or encouraging the adoption of travel restrictions in response to the pandemic. In addition, any need for verification of certificates established by Regulation (EU) 2021/953 should not be considered to justify the temporary reintroduction of controls at internal borders. This proposal complements the proposal to extend the period of application of Regulation (EU) 2021/953 on a framework for the issue, verification and acceptance of interoperable covid-19 vaccination, testing and recovery certificates (EU Digital COVID Certificate) in order to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I Regulation (recast)), recasting Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, was adopted. Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 will enter into application on 10 January 2015. In December 2012, an agreement was reached on the so-called “patent package”: two Regulations on the unified patent ( Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012). These were adopted in enhanced cooperation involving 25 Member States (all Member States except Italy and Spain); and an international Agreement (the ""Unified Patent Court Agreement"" or ""UPC Agreement"") , laying the ground for the creation of unitary patent protection in the European Union. This was signed on 19 Februrary 2013 by the majority of Member States. Article 89(1) of the UPC Agreement provides that the Agreement cannot enter into force prior to the entry into force of the amendments to the Brussels I Regulation (recast) regulating the relationship between both instruments. On 15 October 2012, the three Member States (Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) who are Contracting Parties to the Treaty of 31 March 1965 concerning the establishment and statute of a Benelux Court of Justice signed a Protocol modifying the said Treaty creating the possibility to extend the competences of the Benelux Court of Justice to include jurisdictional competences in specific matters which come within the scope of the Brussels I Regulation. As a result, similar to the UPC Agreement, the Protocol to the Benelux Treaty requires an amendment to the Brussels I Regulation (recast) with the aim (i) to ensure compliance between the revised Treaty and the Brussels I Regulation (recast), and (ii) to address the lack of common jurisdiction rules vis-à-vis defendants in non-European Union States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the matter of jurisdictional rules vis-à-vis State defendants was extensively assessed in the Commission's impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposal amending Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (""Brussels I""). The conclusions of that assessment are a fortiori relevant for the limited harmonisation foreseen in this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 67(4) and points (a), (c) and (e) of Article 81(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal aims, firstly, at allowing the entry into force of the UPC Agreement. Article 89(1) of the UPC Agreement makes the entry into force of the Agreement dependent on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2012. In addition, the proposal aims at ensuring compliance with the Brussels I Regulation of this Agreement as well as the Protocol to the Benelux Treaty of 1965. In order to ensure the combined and coherent application of the Agreement and Protocol and the Brussels I Regulation (recast), it is necessary to address the following issues in the Brussels I Regulation (recast): clarify in the text of the Regulation that the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice are ‘courts’ within the meaning of the Brussels I Regulation; clarify the operation of the rules on jurisdiction with respect to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice insofar as defendants domiciled in Member States are concerned; create uniform rules for the international jurisdiction vis-à-vis third State defendants in proceedings against such defendants brought in the Unified Patent Court and Benelux Court of Justice in situations where the Brussels I Regulation does not itself provide for such rules but refers to national law; define the application of the rules on lis pendens and related actions in relation to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice, on the one hand, and the national courts of Member States which are not Contracting Party to the respective international agreements on the other; clarify the operation of the rules on recognition and enforcement in the relations between Member States which are and Member States which are not Contracting Parties to the respective international agreements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the European Union’s budget."

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Agreement, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Given that the implementing acts form part of the common commercial policy, the examination procedure should be used for their adoption. The Commission should adopt such implementing acts immediately: where the Agreement provides for the possibility, in exceptional and critical circumstances, to apply urgent measures necessary to deal with the situation; for measures concerning agricultural and fishery products, in cases of duly justified imperative grounds of urgency. Under the Agreement, certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Kosovo may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. The proposal lays down provisions regulating the management and review of these tariff quotas in order to allow for their thorough assessment."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the use of hired vehicles can reduce the costs of undertakings carrying goods on their own account or for hire and reward and at the same time increase their operational flexibility. Directive 2006/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for a minimum level of the market opening for the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road. However, this Directive: allows Member States to restrict the use of hired goods vehicles with a gross vehicle weight above six tonnes for own account operations; restricts the use of a vehicle which has been hired in a Member State different from the one where the undertaking hiring the vehicle is established. The Commission therefore proposes to remove these restrictions and establish a uniform regulatory framework across the EU to ensure equal access for transport operators across the EU to the market for hired vehicles. The proposal is part of a series of proposals in the field of road transport which the Commission intends to adopt in 2017. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option aims to: (i) allow the use of hired goods vehicles for own account operations throughout the EU; (ii) allow the use of goods vehicles which an operator established in one Member State has hired in another Member State for a certain period of time. Expected benefits include: a reduction in operating costs of EU hauliers by a total of EUR 158 million in 2030; a total annual economic benefit of around EUR 240 million in 2030 for the vehicle rental/leasing sector; the creation of almost 5 000 additional jobs (2 900 in the vehicle rental/leasing sector and 1 700 in the road haulage business). CONTENT: the proposal amending Directive 2006/1/EC seeks to: allow the use within its territory of vehicles hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State provided that the vehicle is registered or put into circulation in compliance with the laws of a Member State; allow the use of a vehicle hired in another Member State is to be allowed for at least four months in any given calendar year to enable undertakings to meet temporary or seasonal demand peaks and/or to replace defective or damaged vehicles. By 5 years after the deadline for transposition of the Directive, the Commission shall submit a report on the implementation and effects of this Directive. The report shall include information on the use of vehicles hired in a Member State other than the Member State of establishment of the undertaking hiring the vehicle. On the basis of this report, the Commission shall assess whether it is necessary to propose additional measures."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 19 May 2010 on a Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), the Commission stressed that interoperability is essential to maximise the social and economic potential of ICT and that, consequently, the Digital Agenda can take off only if interoperability is ensured. As mentioned in its 2013 annual growth survey, the Commission considers the cross-border interoperability of online services and the digitisation of European public administrations to be important contributors to growth and increased efficiency. To enable efficient and effective interaction with citizens and businesses, Member States should modernise their administrations and provide interoperable digital services at national and European level. However, because it takes place at national level and lacks European-level interoperability, such change very often throws up electronic barriers (‘e-barriers’) that prevent citizens and businesses from using public services efficiently and impede the smooth functioning of the internal market. Activities under the programmes put in place by the Commission since 1995 (IDA, IDABC and ISA) have contributed significantly to ensuring interoperability in the electronic exchange of information between European public administrations. In its Resolution of 20 April 2012, the European Parliament recognised the contribution and overarching role of the ISA Programme in defining, promoting and supporting the implementation of interoperability solutions and frameworks for European public administrations. It also called for an increase in the financial allocations for interoperability solutions between the EU public administrations for 2014-2020. With the ISA Programme coming to an end on 31 December 2015, a new EU programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens is needed. On 24 and 25 October 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions stressing that the modernisation of public administrations should continue, with the swift implementation of services, such as e-government, e-health, e-invoicing and e-procurement that rely on interoperability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the 2012 interim evaluation for the ISA Programme, the Commission considers that the adoption of the new programme will help reduce the cost and administrative burden of cross-border interaction for all concerned, further improve the internal market and freedom of movement in the EU without administrative e-barriers, and contribute to the swift implantation of ICT systems supporting EU legislation. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to establish, for 2016-2020, a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (‘the ISA2 programme’). The proposed programme succeeds the ISA Programme and will consolidate, promote and expand its activities. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: improve, operate and re-use existing cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; develop, operate and re-use new cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; assess the ICT implications of proposed or adopted Union legislation and identify areas in which new legislation could promote interoperability; create a European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) to be used as the tool for building and assessing interoperability solutions; create an instrument to facilitate the re-use of existing interoperability solutions and to identify the areas in which such solutions are still missing; assess and promote existing common specifications and standards and develop new common specifications and standards; introduce a mechanism that will measure and quantify the benefits of interoperability solutions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for implementation of the new ISA2 Programme for the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 is EUR 130 928 000. The proposed envelope is consistent with the current Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020."
2102EP7,"""""European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX)""""",0.789,0.689,0.018,0.194,0.273,0.699,0.636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) to clarify the mandate of the Agency and address shortcomings. PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: the Frontex Agency was set up in 2004 and became operational in 2005. In 2008, the commission adopted a Communication on the evaluation and future development of the FRONTEX Agency, accompanied by a impact assessment. The Communication issued recommendations for the short to medium term and launched ideas for the future development of the Agency in the longer term. It was welcomed by the Council and the European Parliament, who both shared the Commissions assessment that the Agency had been very successful since its inception and called for a further strengthening of the Agency. An independent evaluation also took place during 2008, on the basis of which the Frontex Management Board made a series of recommendations concerning changes to the legal basis of the Agency. This proposal reflects all recommendations of the 2008 Communication and the Management Board recommendations to the extent they require a revision of the legal framework of the Agency, with the exceptions as described in the impact assessment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment has been carried out - Commission staff working document SEC(2010)0149. The preferred option of the impact assessment consists of a combination of the following sub-options: a revised mechanism with compulsory contributions of equipment from Member States combined with the gradual acquisition/leasing by Frontex of its own equipment, based on further analyses of needs and costs; a revised mechanism with compulsory contributions of human resources from Member States combined with a pool of border guards on semi-permanent detachment from Member States to Frontex, with the status of national experts; awarding the Agency a co-leading role for the implementation of joint operations, with detailed rules for the operational plan, evaluation, and incident reporting, to be enforced by Frontex; allowing Frontex to finance and implement technical assistance projects in third countries and to deploy liaison officers in third countries; giving Frontex a limited mandate to process personal data related to fight against criminal networks organising illegal immigration, under condition that such processing of personal data by Frontex is lawful, necessary and proportionate in relation to the tasks of the Agency; giving Frontex a coordinating role in implementing joint return operations; giving Frontex a mandate to analyse operational risks and requirements in the Member States. The preferred option is fully reflected in this legislative proposal with the exception of giving Frontex a limited mandate to process personal data related to fighting criminal networks organising illegal immigration. The Commission does consider that all possibilities to reinforce the fight against the smuggling of migrants and against trafficking of human beings should be explored. However, it prefers to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategy for information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflection to be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between Agencies in the justice and home affairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 74 and 77 (1) (b) and (c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The proposal is within the limits set by these provisions and, in particular, respects the shared competencies of the Treaty in that Member States remain responsible for controlling their external borders. Notably this proposal upholds the principle that in the context of operations coordinated by the Agency, guest officers may only perform tasks and exercise powers under instructions from and, as a general rule, in the presence of border guards of the host Member State. Decisions to refuse entry in accordance with the Schengen Borders Code shall be taken only by border guards of the host Member State. No decision-making power in this regard is transferred to the Agency. The objectives of this proposal, while respecting the same fundamental limitations of the existing provisions, are to further develop an integrated management of operational cooperation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. CONTENT: the Commission presents a proposal to strengthen the FRONTEX Agency. The most important amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 reflect the changes necessary to accommodate the preferred option of the impact assessment. Moreover a number of minor amendments of an essentially administrative character have been introduced taking into account the Management Board recommendations as well as the introduction of new ""standard"" provisions used in other Commission proposals for the setting up of new Agencies. The main amendments to the Regulation are as follows: Establishment of the Agency : the proposal clarifies the legal framework in which the Agency operates. It states that, while considering that the responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders lies with the Member States, the Agency shall facilitate and render more effective the application of existing and future EU measures relating to the management of external borders, in particular the Schengen Borders Code, and in accordance with relevant Union law, international law, obligations related to access to international protection, and fundamental rights. It shall do so by ensuring the coordination of Member States' actions in the implementation of those measures, thereby contributing to an efficient, high and uniform level of control on persons and surveillance of the external borders of the Member States. Definitions : the proposal clarifies the definition of ""host Member State"", and introduces the concept of Frontex Joint Support Teams, and revises the definition of technical equipment. Main tasks : these include risk analysis and research. The proposal introduces the possibility for the Agency of coordinating joint return operations. The Agency also has new tasks related to the development and operation of information systems and to the provision of assistance to Eurosur. In addition, all personnel taking part in joint operations or joint return operations are required to have received appropriate training in fundamental rights. Lastly, a reporting mechanism to the Management Board regarding the operational activities of Member States with third countries is introduced. Joint operations and pilot projects at the external borders : the Agency is required to draw up an operational plan, to conduct a prior risk analysis. The Agency may also terminate joint operations and pilot projects if the conditions to conduct these initiatives are no longer fulfilled. Furthermore, it shall constitute a pool of border guards called Frontex Joint Support Teams, for possible deployment during joint operations and pilot projects. The proposal requires the Agency to evaluate the results of the joint operations and pilot projects and transmit the detailed evaluation reports within 60 days following the end of the activity to the Management Board. Lastly, it provides that the Agency may decide to finance or co-finance the joint operations and pilot projects, with grants from its budget in accordance with the financial rules applicable to the Agency."" Organisational aspects of joint operations and pilot projects : a new article sets out the obligation to draw up an operational plan for all operations. This article makes provision regarding the content of the operational plan, the respective tasks and responsibilities, the composition of the teams, command and control, the reporting mechanisms i.e. evaluation and incident reporting, the technical equipment, and the applicable jurisdiction. The Agency and the requesting Member State must agree on the operational plan and the Agency must ensure the operational implementation of all organisational aspects. Composition and deployment of Frontex Joint Support Teams (FJST): a new article sets out the obligations and conditions related to border guards to be made available to the FJST. Member States must make the border guards available for deployment. Members of the teams must perform their duties in full respect of fundamental rights and human dignity. The Agency must nominate a coordinating officer where FJST members are deployed. It will meet the costs of border guards of Member States participating in FJST Risk analysis: for the Agency’s risk analysis, Member States must provide the Agency with all necessary information regarding the situation and possible threats at the external borders. The Agency shall regularly evaluate the capacity of the Member States to face upcoming challenges, including present and future threats and pressures at the external borders of the EU. Training: Member States must integrate the common core curricula in the training of national border guards. The training must include fundamental rights aspects. Research: the proposal strengthens the role of the Agency i.e. monitoring and contributing to developments in relevant research activities Technical equipment : the new provisions clarify the Agency’s powers regarding the acquisition or lease of technical equipment and the rules of registration for heavy equipment The Agency must also keep centralised records of a Technical Equipment Pool (TEP). Member States must contribute to the TEP to allow for a minimum amount of equipment covering the needs of the Agency. The article sets out rules regarding the management by the Agency of the TEP, and rules for the reimbursement of the minimum numbers per type of equipment, and the conditions for deployment and the eligible costs Return cooperation : the proposal clarifies EU return policy, financial provisions and inserts the possibility for a Member State to request the Agency to ensure the coordination of a return operation. The Agency must adopt a Code of Conduct to be applied during joint return operations, including with regard to forced return monitoring and respect for fundamental rights. Member States must inform the Agency of their planned return operations and the degree of assistance requested from the Agency. The Agency must draw up a rolling operational plan on which the Management Board decides. The proposal clarifies the role of the Agency regarding the identification of relevant third countries Information exchange systems : the Agency is required develop and operate an information system capable of exchanging classified information. Data protection : a new Article requires the Agency to process data in accordance with Regulation 45/2001 and the Management Board to establish measures to apply the aforementioned Regulation. Security rules on the protection of classified information and non-classified sensitive information : another new article requires the Agency to apply the security principles of Decision 2001/844 for classified information, and to process non-classified sensitive information as adopted and implemented by the Commission. Facilitation of operational cooperation with third countries and cooperation with competent authorities of third countries : the proposal gives the Agency the possibility of deploying liaison officers in third countries, and the tasks of the latter are set out in the text. The Agency may benefit from Union funding in accordance with the provisions of the relevant instruments supporting the Union's external relations policy. Member States must clarify where appropriate the role of the Agency in their bilateral agreements with third countries. The deployment of liaison officers and the conclusion of working arrangements with third countries are subject to prior approval by the Commission. Headquarters Agreement : a new clause clarifies the need for a Headquarters Agreement between the Agency and the hosting Member State. In addition, the proposal makes some modifications on provisions related to staff, the powers of the Management Board on staffing policy, the composition of the Management Board and the functions and powers of the Executive Director. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal amends an existing Regulation regarding the mandate and functioning of a European Agency. The subsidy related to the Frontex Agency forms already part of the Union's budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. Space supports many policies and strategic priorities of the Union. It can play a crucial role in effectively tackling new challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, border control, maritime surveillance and security of Union citizens. The Union’s space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. It is therefore crucial that the Union remains a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, that it encourages scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission stressed in the space strategy for Europe, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of the services offered by Galileo and EGNOS (the global and regional satellite navigation systems) and Copernicus (Union Earth observation and monitoring programme) and of preparing new generations of these services, enhancing the space surveillance and tracking (SST) services and announced the governmental satellite communications initiative ‘GOVSATCOM’. The Commission's approach was advocated both by the Council in its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2017 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 12 September 2017. The development and implementation of a space programme is beyond the financial and technical capabilities of a single Member State and can only be achieved at EU level. By providing a coherent framework for future investment, a fully integrated space programme shall bring together all the Union's activities in this highly strategic field. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027. It aims to consolidate all existing and new space activities in a single programme. The general objectives of the proposed new programme are as follows: provide high-quality, up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space data, information and services, where possible on a global scale, meeting existing and future needs and able to meet the Union's political priorities, including climate change and security and defence; maximise socio-economic benefits, including by promoting the widest possible use of data, information and services provided by programme components; strengthen the security of the Union and its Member States, its freedom of action and its strategic autonomy; promote the Union’s role on the international stage as a leading actor in the space sector. The programme shall have the following specific objectives: Galileo and EGNOS : to provide of state-of-the-art and, where appropriate, secure positioning, navigation and timing services. The programme shall continue to invest in operations and infrastructure to complement and maintain the satellite constellation, improve signal precision to provide positioning information for autonomous and connected vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors, and encourage the market introduction of satellite navigation services; Copernicus : to deliver accurate and reliable Earth Observation data and information, supplied on a long-term basis, to support the implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States' policies in the fields of the environment, climate change, agriculture and rural development, civil protection, safety and security, as well as the digital economy; Space Situational Awareness (SSA) : to enhance SST capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects which helps avoid collisions in space and monitors the re-entry of space objects to Earth, to monitor space weather and to map and network Member States near Earth object capacities; GOVSATCOM : to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services, to enhance the operational effectiveness of security actors and safeguard citizens' rights to security, to diplomatic or consular protection, and to protection of personal data. The programme shall also: (i) contribute, where this is required for the needs of the Programme, to an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space; (ii) support and reinforce the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity to innovate of legal and natural persons from the Union active or wishing to become active in that sector, with particular regard to the position and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Governance : the proposal clarifies the relations between the various players involved and the role of these players, mainly the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Agency for Space, and by establishing a unified system of governance for all the components of this programme. It enhances the role of the former European GNSS Agency by expanding the scope of its tasks as regards security accreditation to include all the components of the Programme, thus justifying a change of name for this agency, which is to become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. Lastly, it specifies and standardises the security framework for the Programme, particularly as regards the principles to be respected, procedures to be followed and measures to be taken, which is of crucial importance, given the dual use nature of the actions. The programme shares similar objectives with other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe, InvestEU Fund, European Defence Fund and Funds under Regulation (EU) on the common provisions Regulation. Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be foreseen. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 16 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, with the following indicative breakdown: for Galileo and EGNOS : EUR 9.7 billion; for Copernicus : EUR 5.8 billion; for SSA/Govsatcom : EUR 0.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC grants equivalence to certain non-EU countries as regards field inspections and production of seed of certain species that are carried out in accordance with Union law. The national provisions governing seed harvested and controlled in these countries afford the same assurances as regards the seed’s characteristics and the arrangements for examining it, for ensuring seed identification, for marking and for control as the provisions applicable to seed harvested and controlled within the European Union. Since Brazil and Moldova are not among these non-EU countries, seed harvested there cannot be imported into the EU. Brazil submitted a request to the Commission that its fodder plant and cereal seed be covered by Council Decision 2003/17/EC as regards the equivalence of such seed. Moldova has submitted a request for the Commission to grant equivalence to its system of field inspections of cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre plant seed, and to cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre seed produced and certified in Moldova. After audits of the field inspections and seed certification systems in Brazil and Moldova, the Commission concluded that the requirements and systems in place in these two countries are equivalent to the EU's and provide the same assurances.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission recalls that the right of EU citizens and their families to move freely and reside in any EU country is one of the four fundamental freedoms enshrined in the EU Treaties. Free movement of persons would not be possible unless the social security rights of mobile Europeans and their family members were protected. In all, it is estimated that: 3.7 million of Europeans are economically inactive mobile citizens; nearly 80 000 mobile citizens are entitled to long-term care benefits, totalling EUR 793 million (0.4% of the total EU expenditure on long-term care benefits); some 27 300 persons within the EU export their unemployment benefit to another Member State; there are 91 700 unemployed cross-border workers per year, 53 500 of whom are frontier workers. This initiative is part of the European Commission's labour mobility package of 2016. Its objective is to continue the process of modernisation of the EU law on social security coordination set out in Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and No 987/2009, by further facilitating the exercise of citizens' rights while ensuring legal clarity, a fair and equitable distribution of the financial burden among the Member States and administrative simplicity and enforceability of the rules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission’s preferred options include the following: to amend the current equal treatment provisions with regard to the access of economically inactive citizens to social benefits; the establishment of a coherent regime for long-term care benefits; new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases (aggregation of periods of insurance; the export of unemployment benefits; paying unemployment benefits to frontier workers); the coordination of family benefits intended to replace income during child-raising periods. CONTENT: the proposal focuses on four areas of coordination where improvements are required: (i) economically inactive citizens' access to social benefits, (ii) long-term care benefits, (iii) unemployment benefits and (iv) family benefits. Each Member State is free to determine the features of its own social security system - which benefits are provided, the conditions for eligibility, how these benefits are calculated and what contributions should be paid, and for all social security branches (old age, unemployment and family benefits), provided that such national provisions respect the principles of EU law in particular concerning equal treatment and non-discrimination. Access to social benefits claimed by economically inactive EU mobile citizens: further to recent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the proposal specifies that access to social security benefits for economically inactive mobile citizens in the host Member State, may be made conditional upon that citizen holding a legal right of residence in that Member State in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The proposal clearly distinguishes an economically inactive citizen from a jobseeker whose right of residence is conferred directly by Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Long-term care benefits: the proposed revision aims to establish a coherent regime for the coordination of long-term care benefits (currently dealt with under the sickness chapter) by introducing a separate Chapter for their coordination in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, by including a definition and providing for a list of those benefits. Unemployment benefits: the proposal sets out new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases. The proposal: requires a minimum qualifying period of three months insurance in the Member State of most recent activity before a right to aggregate past periods of insurance arises (while requiring the Member State of previous activity to provide benefits when this condition is not fulfilled); extends the minimum period for an export of unemployment benefits from three to six months while providing for the possibility of exporting the benefit for the whole period of entitlement. The aim is to improve the opportunities for unemployed persons moving to another Member State to look for work and their chances for reintegration into the labour market and to address skills mismatches across borders; makes the Member State of most recent employment responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits when the frontier worker has worked there for at least 12 months and otherwise attributing the responsibility to the Member State of residence. Child benefits : the proposal aims to change the current coordination provisions so that child-raising allowances are considered individual and personal rights and to permit an optional right for the secondary competent Member State to pay the benefit in full. Posted workers : the proposal clarifies the rules on applicable legislation and the relationship between the Regulations on coordination and Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. It strengthens the administrative rules on social security coordination in the fields of information exchange and verification of the social security status of such workers in order to prevent potentially unfair practices or abuse. Technical amendments : the proposed amendments concern: (i) the prioritisation of derived rights to sickness benefits; (ii) the reimbursement of costs for medical examination; (iii) the calculation of the annual average costs in the field of sickness benefits; and (iv) the introduction of measures to facilitate identification of fraud or error in the application of the Regulations, including the introduction of a permissive ground for Member States to periodically exchange personal data. Furthermore, the procedures for recovery of unduly paid social security benefits have been revised to align them with the equivalent procedures in Directive 2010/24/EU concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other measures. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the recent military aggression by Russia against Ukraine, the European Union and in particular its eastern regions are facing a massive influx of people. This poses an additional challenge for public budgets at a time when Member States’ economies are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and risks undermining the preparation of a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy. Member States are already able to finance a broad range of investments to address migratory challenges under their operational programmes with support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), including from the additional resources made available as Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). The Commission has already taken steps to assist Member States in this regard, through its ‘Cohesion Action for Refugees in Europe’ (CARE) initiative of 8 March 2022. Notwithstanding the room for manoeuvre offered by the CARE package, Member States face additional immediate budgetary pressures arising from the management of mass arrivals of people fleeing Ukraine. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. The Commission therefore considers it necessary, as a temporary and exceptional measure, to increase the amount of pre-financing paid under REACT-EU for all Member States. BACKGROUND: this proposal provides for exceptional and targeted changes to the 2014-2020 legal framework established for the European Structural and Investment Funds and for the Fund for the European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in response to the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the subsequent impact on the European Union and several of its eastern regions in particular. It is proposed to amend Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 and (EU) No 223/2014 in order to provide for an increased percentage of pre-financing to be paid under REACT-EU, which is necessary to respond to this unprecedented situation. In addition to the initial pre-financing, the Commission will pay 4% of the REACT-EU resources allocated to programmes for the year 2021 as additional initial pre-financing in 2022. For programmes in Member States which have had a level of arrivals of persons from Ukraine greater than 1% of their national population between 24 February 2022 and 23 March 2022, that percentage shall be increased to 34%. In order to monitor the use of this additional pre-financing, the final reports on the implementation of ERDF and ESF programmes benefiting from such pre-financing should include information on how the additional amounts received have been used to address the migration challenges linked to Russia's military aggression and have contributed to the recovery of the economy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal only concerns REACT-EU, which is financed by the European Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU. The additional initial pre-financing payments in 2022 will be financed from external assigned revenues. All amounts will be available as external assigned revenues, within the meaning of the Financial Regulation stemming from the Next GenerationEU borrowing operations. The amount paid as additional initial pre-financing will be totally cleared from the Commission accounts not later than when the operational programme is closed, such that the total amount of payments made under REACT-EU will remain unchanged with this proposal. Similarly, the total commitment appropriations under REACT-EU will not be modified."
13017EP9,"""""Temporary trade liberalisation supplementing trade concessions applicable to Ukrainian products under EU/Ukraine Association Agreement""""",0.855,0.731,0.77,0.37,0.474,0.824,0.695,0.537,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to introduce temporary and exceptional trade liberalisation measures in order to support and foster existing trade flows from Ukraine to the EU. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression by Russia against Ukraine since 24 February 2022 has seriously weakened Ukraine's ability to trade with the rest of the world, also due to the destruction of production capacities and the unavailability of many means of transport because of the closure of access to the Black Sea. In order to mitigate the negative economic impact of the aggression, the development of closer economic relations between the EU and Ukraine must be accelerated in order to provide rapid support to the Ukrainian authorities and people in these exceptional circumstances. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to stimulate trade flows and to grant concessions in the form of trade liberalisation measures for all products, in line with the acceleration of the elimination of customs duties on trade between the EU and Ukraine. CONTENT: the proposed regulation introduces trade liberalisation measures in the form of the following three measures, which should apply for one year: - temporary suspension of all outstanding tariffs under Title IV of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine establishing a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA). This concerns three categories of products: (i) industrial products subject to duty phase out by the end of 2022; (ii) fruits and vegetables subject to the entry-price system; (iii) agricultural products and processed agricultural products subject to tariff-rate quotas; - temporary non-collection of anti-dumping duties on imports originating in Ukraine as of the date of entry into force of this Regulation; and - temporary suspension of the application of the common rules for imports (safeguard) with respect of imports originating in Ukraine. The trade-liberalising measures provided for under the present proposal for a Regulation are taken in observance of the commitment in Article 2 of the Association Agreement which enshrines as an essential element of the Agreement the promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence. These measures would be conditional upon respect for the same basic principles set out in Article 2, including those providing that the respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law constitute essential elements of that Agreement. Normal safeguard procedures would apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: based on an estimation according to the level of imports from Ukraine in 2021, the EU will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to less than EUR 31 million annually. The loss of anti-dumping duties is estimated at EUR 34.6 million. This figure is very likely to be significantly lower as the level of imports from Ukraine has been affected by the conflict. Therefore, the impact on the EU’s own resources will be very limited."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. CONTENT: Article 19 of Council Regulation No 1311/2013 stipulates that in the event of the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or programmes under shared management for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum and Migration Fund and the Internal Security Fund, the MFF shall be revised in order to transfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure ceilings, allocations not used in 2014. The revision concerning the transfer of unused allocation for the year 2014 shall be adopted before 1 May 2015. It thus applies to programmes adopted after 1 January 2014 even when the relevant legal act was adopted by that time. Moreover, ‘rules’ covers not only the basic legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds concerned, but also implementing and delegated acts, to the extent to which they are a prerequisite for preparing or finalising the programmes. Consequently, this provision also applies to funds from the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative as the legal basis is the same as for programmes. It also applies to the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) as its commitments originate from the Structural Funds and are implemented under shared management. Article 19 also covers contributions from the ERDF to the cross-border and sea-basin programmes established under the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance as those amounts are part of national allocations defined in Article 91(2) of the ESI Funds’ Common Provisions Regulation (CPR). It should be noted that Article 19 does not impose any constraints as to the profile of the transfer of allocations to subsequent years. Amounts concerned: as a result of such late adoption: This proposal seeks to amend Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring the commitment appropriations not used in 2014 to subsequent years for sub-heading 1b, heading 2 and heading 3. N.B. the Commission proposes to transfer the bulk of the allocations not used in 2014 to year 2015 in order to keep the pace of investments for growth and jobs, minimise differences of treatment with programmes adopted in 2014 and ensure equal treatment with programmes whose 2014 commitment tranche is carried-over in accordance with Article 13 of the Financial Regulation. An annex sets outs details of the amounts transferred by the Funds concerned and by year of transfer. IMPLICATIONS ON PAYMENTS: concerning the implications on payments in 2015, they will be covered within the voted budget for 2015. The first initial pre-financing that has not been paid in 2014 will have to be paid in 2015 together with the second pre-financing. However, the corresponding unused appropriations in 2014 have been used by transfers to reduce the backlog of unpaid bills from the previous period 2007-2013 and the reverse operation could be done, if need be, in 2015 to cover the pre-financings. The medium and longer term implications on interim payments of the transfer are more difficult to predict. The legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds contain provisions for the automatic decommitment of appropriations not used within a given deadline, which is of n+3 years for the ESI Funds and of n+2 years for the AMIF and the ISF. This could in principle result in a shift of payments from one year to another without this lowering the overall needs over the 2014-2020 period. On the other hand, the real pace of implementation will not be pre-determined by the transfer. For these reasons, the Commission does not propose to revise the payment ceilings. It will review the situation regularly in the light of implementation and make proposals if appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MFF Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The objective of this proposal is to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1300/2008 establishing a multi-annual plan for the stock of herring distributed to the west of Scotland and the fisheries exploiting that stock. This act was adopted prior to the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Plan has as its core objective to ensure the exploitation of the herring stock in the area west of Scotland on the basis of maximum sustainable yield. Science may evolve and improve, and the Plan needs to contain the necessary provisions to ensure it is kept up to date with the best science available. Thus, Article 7 of the Regulation stipulates that if it appears that the fishing mortality rates and associated spawning stock biomass levels used for the purposes of the Plan are no longer appropriate in light of scientific advice, the Council must revise such parameters so as to ensure that the plan can attain its management objectives. The current text therefore confers the power to amend these non-essential elements of the Plan on the Council. Such decision-making procedure is no longer possible under the TFEU. Similarly, Article 8 provides for modification by the Council of certain elements of the plan (including the biological reference levels) and for adoption by the Council of measures alternative or additional to the plan. By way of consequence, the decision-making procedure foreseen in Article 7 and 8 of the Regulation should be converted into a system of delegated powers to be exercised by the Commission under the conditions set out in the Plan itself and where the analysis has shown that the currently envisaged procedures may be qualified as delegated powers in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU. The Plan should therefore be amended accordingly. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget."
1961EP7,"""""Consumer rights (final vote)""""",0.842,0.832,0.842,0.387,0.455,0.819,0.867,0.8,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to contribute to the better functioning of the business-to-consumer internal market by enhancing consumer confidence in the internal market and reducing business reluctance to trade cross-border. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is a result of the review of the Consumer Acquis which covers a number of Directives on consumer protection. The Review was launched in 2004 with the objective to simplify and complete the existing regulatory framework. The proposal aims at revising four Directives: Directive 85/577/EEC on contracts negotiated away from business premises, Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts, Directive 97/7/EC on distance contracts, Directive 1999/44/EC on consumer sales and guarantees. These four Directives provide for consumer contractual rights. They contain minimum harmonisation clauses meaning that Member States may maintain or adopt stricter consumer protection rules. Member States have made extensive use of this possibility. The outcome is a fragmented regulatory framework across the Community which causes significant compliance costs for businesses wishing to trade cross-border. The internal market effects of the fragmentation are a reluctance by businesses to sell cross-border to consumers which in turn reduces consumer welfare. That review has shown that it is appropriate to replace those four Directives by this single Directive. This Directive should accordingly lay down standard rules for the common aspects and move away from the minimum harmonisation approach in the former Directives under which Member States could maintain or adopt stricter national rules. The European Parliament, in its Resolution of 6 September 2007 recommended that legislative action is taken and expressed its preference for the adoption of an instrument taking the form of a horizontal Directive based on full targeted harmonisation. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to contribute to the proper functioning of the business-to-consumer internal market and achieve a high common level of consumer protection by fully harmonising the key aspects of consumer contract law which are relevant for the internal market. - Chapter I contains the common definitions such as 'consumer' and 'trader' and lays down the principle of full harmonisation. - Chapter II contains a core of information to be provided by traders prior to the conclusion of all consumer contracts as well as an information obligation on intermediaries concluding contracts on behalf of consumers. - Chapter III which only applies to distance and off-premises contracts, provides for specific information requirements and regulates the right of withdrawal (length, exercise and effects) in a consistent manner. It also refers to a standard withdrawal form reproduced in Annex I(B). - Chapter IV clarifies the provisions of Directive 99/44/EC. It maintains the principle that the trader is liable to the consumer for a period of two years if the goods are not in conformity with the contract. It introduces a new rule whereby the risk of loss or damage of the goods is transferred to the consumer only when he or a third person indicated by him other than the carrier acquires the material possession of the goods. - Chapter V broadly reflects the provision of Directive 93/13/EEC. It applies to unfair contract terms which have not been individually negotiated, such as standard contract terms. Unfair terms are those creating significant imbalances in the rights and obligations of consumers and of traders and are not binding on consumers. In order to ensure legal certainty, the Directive contains two lists of unfair terms. Annex II contains a list of terms which in all circumstances are considered unfair. Annex III contains a list of terms which are deemed unfair unless the trader proves otherwise. These same lists apply in all Member States and may only be amended by the comitology procedure provided for by the Directive."

3708EP7,"""""Accounting rules and action plans on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities related to land use""""",0.895,0.89,0.912,0.29,0.212,0.843,0.887,0.857,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to gradually integrate the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector into the Union’s climate policy by means of a separate legal framework which addresses the sector’s specific profile and by ensuring a robust and harmonised accounting framework. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: appropriate land uses and management practices in forestry and agriculture can limit emissions of carbon and enhance removals from the atmosphere. Such practices are covered by the LULUCF sector, which comprises mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and removals by terrestrial ecosystems, generally estimated as carbon stock changes. Agriculture, forestry, related industries and energy are the most important economic sectors relevant for LULUCF and they can contribute to the reduction of emissions and enhancement of sinks in several ways. Although the LULUCF sector does not yet count towards the Union’s emission reduction target for 2020, it counts in part towards the Union’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC for the period from 2008 to 2012. However, the existing international accounting rules, which are a mix of voluntary and mandatory practices, have significant drawbacks. Most importantly, accounting is voluntary for most LULUCF activities, notably for forest management (representing about 70% of the sector) and for cropland and grazing-land management (representing about 17% of the sector). As a result, accounting in this first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol varies greatly between Member States. Another drawback is the lack of incentives for climate change mitigation in forestry. Improvements in accounting are necessary to create a level playing field within the agricultural, forestry and related industries and energy sectors in the Member States with a view to ensuring their consistent treatment within the Union’s internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment investigated three key issues that need to be addressed when assessing how LULUCF should be included in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments, namely how to: ensure robust accounting rules for emissions and removals; achieve robust monitoring and reporting; establish the appropriate policy context for bringing the sector into the Union’s climate change commitments. Based on the policy context for including the sector in the Union’s commitments currently regulated by the ESD and the EU ETS, the impact assessment considered three options for including LULUCF, namely as part of the ESD, as a separate framework or by delaying inclusion altogether. Each option addressed the issues of accounting and monitoring. The potential social, economic and environmental impacts of the various options were considered in detail. The impact assessment concluded that there were good reasons to include LULUCF in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission-reduction commitments, namely to improve their policy coherence, environmental integrity and economic efficiency. But this will only be possible if the right policy context for LULUCF is put in place. The high variability of emissions and removals in forests means that annual emission reduction targets of the kind that apply to other sectors are unsuitable. The long lead times needed for mitigation measures to take effect also set LULUCF apart from most other sectors. In view of this, the impact assessment indicated that a separate legal framework for LULUCF would be the preferred option. In terms of accounting, the suitable options identified included mandatory accounting of emissions and removals from both forestry and agricultural activities and giving equal weight to mitigation action irrespective of whether it was taken in the forestry, agriculture, related industries or energy sectors. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of this Decision is to establish robust and comprehensive accounting rules for LULUCF as well as to enable future policy development towards the full inclusion of LULUCF in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments when the conditions are right. To this end this Decision establishes a framework for: a mandatory accounting obligation on Member States as regards greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks associated with agricultural and forestry activities in the LULUCF sector and voluntary accounting for revegetation and wetland drainage and rewetting; the general accounting rules that must be applied; the specific accounting rules for afforestation, reforestation, deforestation, forest management, changes in the harvested wood products pool, cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation, and wetland drainage and rewetting; the specific rules for accounting for natural disturbances; adopting LULUCF Action Plans in Member States designed to limit or reduce emissions by sources and maintain or increase removals by sinks associated with LULUCF activities, and for the evaluation of those plans by the Commission; the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to: 1. update the definitions in the light of changes to definitions adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol or other multilateral agreement relevant to climate change concluded by the Union; 2. amend Annex I to add accounting periods and ensure consistency between those accounting periods and the relevant periods applicable to Union emission reduction commitments in other sectors, 3. amend Annex II with updated reference levels in accordance with the proposed reference levels submitted by Member States pursuant to Article 6 subject to corrections made in accordance with this Decision; 4. revise the information specified in Annex III in accordance with scientific progress and to revise the conditions relating to the accounting rules for natural disturbances laid down in Article 9(2) in the light of scientific progress or to reflect revisions to acts adopted by UNFCCC or Kyoto Protocol bodies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this Decision will be implemented using the existing budget and will not have an impact on the multi-annual financial framework.

3113EP7,"""""Minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime""""",0.737,0.85,0.842,0.419,0.455,0.88,0.862,0.571,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: establish minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a legislative package which aims at strengthening the rights of victims in the EU and which also includes the following two other elements: a communication on strengthening victims' rights in the EU and a proposal for a Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters. The European Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, the cornerstone of which is the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and other decisions of judicial authorities taken in civil and criminal matters within the Union. It has already acted on the rights of victims in criminal proceedings through Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. Whilst improvements have been achieved in this area, the objectives of the Council Framework Decision have not been fully realised. The European Parliament has also called upon the Council to adopt a comprehensive legal framework offering victims of crime the widest protection5. In its resolution of 26 November 2009 on the elimination of violence against women, the Parliament called on the Member States to improve their national laws and policies to combat all forms of violence against women and to act in order to tackle the causes of violence against women, not least by employing preventive measures and called on the Union to guarantee the right to assistance, protection and support for all victims of violence. Declaration 19 of the protocols to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also calls on Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent and punish acts of domestic violence and to support and protect the victims of such violence. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Union is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions. Mutual recognition can only operate effectively in a spirit of confidence, whereby not only judicial authorities but all those involved in the criminal justice process and others who have a legitimate interest in it can trust in the adequacy of the rules of each Member State and trust that those rules are correctly applied. Where victims of crime are not subject to the same minimum standards throughout the EU, such trust can be reduced due to concerns over the treatment of victims or due to differences in procedural rules. Common minimum rules should thus lead to increased confidence in the criminal justice systems of all Member States, which in turn should lead to more efficient judicial cooperation in a climate of mutual trust as well as to the promotion of a fundamental rights culture in the European Union. It is for this reason that the Commission is now proposing this legislative framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the European Commission considered five options: retention of the status quo (option 1) and four other policy options (options 2, 3a, 3b and 4). Option 1 – Status Quo : retention of the status quo. No action at EU level. Option 2 – Low level of obligation : least prescriptive option. Imposes minimum obligations on Member States to establish systems or services with minimum detail on what standards should be achieved. When necessary to take legal measures, this option requires the least changes in national procedural laws. Option 3a – Medium level obligation : medium prescriptive option. Imposes medium level of obligation on Member States for all measures to establish services and rights and imposes provisions on what such services should be while defining minimum details on what standards to be applied. The level of obligations on Member States is low and does not require Member States to establish Restorative Justice Services (RJS) but only to ensure that safeguards and minimum quality standards are applied where RJS are used. Option 3b – Medium/High level obligation : medium prescriptive option. Imposes medium level of obligation on Member States for all measures to establish services and rights and imposes provisions on what such services should be while defining minimum details on what standards to be applied. Option 4 – Highest level of obligation : the most prescriptive option. Imposes a range of obligations on Member States to establish services and rights. It also imposes more detailed provisions on what such services should be and the exact standards that should be applied. The impact assessment concluded that it was necessary to replace the 2001 Framework Decision with a new Directive containing concrete obligations on the rights of victims. Option 3a was the preferred option of the Commission. Legislation should be followed with practical measures to facilitate implementation. It would also be a first step in this field with further studies and action envisaged, in particular in relation to compensation of victims and legal aid for victims. LEGAL BASIS: Article 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Directive intends to replace the 2001 Framework Decision with a new Directive containing concrete obligations on the rights of victims. A number of provisions of Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings have been maintained in their original form or have been amended only to the extent necessary for clarity of drafting. The following comments concentrate on those areas which introduce substantive changes to the Framework Decision: Definitions : the purpose of this Directive is to ensure that all victims of crime benefit from minimum standards throughout the EU. In particular, this Directive makes provision for support and protection to be given to family members of victims since such persons are often also harmed by the crime and may themselves be at risk of secondary victimisation as well as victimisation or intimidation by the offender or his associates. All provisions in this Directive are also applicable to family members of a victim whose death has been caused by a criminal offence since such persons have specific and legitimate interests in the proceedings beyond those of family members of surviving victims and are often recognised as representatives of the victim. Information rights and right to understand and to be understood :a series of provisions are provided in order to ensure that victims receive sufficient information in a form they can understand to enable them to fully access their rights and to ensure they feel treated in a respectful manner. Such information should be available from the moment a victim makes a complaint of a criminal offence as well as on a regular basis throughout criminal proceedings and in relation to the progress of the case. Sufficient detail should be provided to enable victims to make informed decisions about their participation in proceedings and how to access their rights, in particular when deciding whether to request a review of the decision not to prosecute. The victim may not understand the language of the information or there may be other factors such as the victim's age, maturity, intellectual and emotional capacities, literacy levels and any disabilities. Right to access victim support services : victims should have access to support services which provide information and advice, emotional and psychological support and practical assistance which are often crucial to the recovery of victims and help them cope with the aftermath of the crime and with the strain of any criminal proceedings. Support should be available from the earliest possible moment after the commission of a crime irrespective of whether it has been reported. Such services can prove particularly important in regard to a victim’s decision to ultimately report a crime. Equally, victims may require support both during the period of any proceedings and in the long term. Support services may be provided by governmental or non-governmental organisations and should not involve excessive procedures and formalities which might reduce effective access to such services. Support may be provided in a variety of ways such as face-to-face meetings, by telephone or other remote means in order to maximise the geographical distribution and availability of services. Certain groups of victims including victims of sexual violence, bias crime such as gender based violence and race hate crime, and victims of terrorism often require specialist support services due to the particular characteristics of the crime they have fallen victim to. Although the provision of support should not be dependent on a victim making a complaint of an offence to the police or other competent authorities, such authorities are often best placed to inform victims of the possibility of support. Member States are therefore encouraged to establish appropriate conditions to enable the referral of victims to victim support services, including by ensuring that data protection requirements can be adhered to. Right to be heard : it is ensured that the victim has an opportunity to provide initial and further information, views or evidence during criminal proceedings. The exact extent of this right is left to national law and may range from basic rights to communicate with and supply evidence to a competent authority through to more extensive rights such as a right to have evidence taken into account, the right to ensure that certain evidence is taken or the right to make interventions during the trial. Rights in the event of a decision not to prosecute : victims should be able to verify that established procedures and rules have been complied with and that a correct decision has been made to end a prosecution in relation to a specific person. Precise mechanisms for a review are left to national law. However, such a review should as a minimum be carried out by a person or authority different to the one that took the original decision not to prosecute. Right to safeguards in the context of mediation and other restorative justice services : restorative justice services encompass a range of services whether attached to, running prior to, in parallel with or after criminal proceedings. They may be available in relation to certain types of crime or only in relation to adult or child offenders and include for example victim offender mediation, family group conferencing and sentencing circles. The proposed Directive ensures that where such services are provided, safeguards are in place to ensure the victim is not further victimised as a result of the process. Such services should therefore have as a primary consideration the interests and needs of the victim, repairing the harm to the victim and avoiding further harm. Participation of the victim should be voluntary which also implies that the victim has sufficient knowledge of the risks and benefits to make an informed choice. It also means that factors such as power imbalances, and the age, maturity or intellectual capacity of the victim which could limit or reduce the victim's ability to make an informed choice or could prejudice a positive outcome for the victim should be taken into consideration in referring a case to and in conducting a restorative process. Whilst private proceedings should in general be confidential, unless agreed otherwise by the parties, factors such as threats made during the process may be considered as requiring disclosure in the public interest. Ultimately any agreement between the parties should be reached voluntarily. Right to reimbursement of expenses : this provision is consistent with the 2001 Framework Decision in providing to victims who participate in criminal proceedings the right to reimbursement of expenses. It also provides for reimbursement where the victim attends the trial without participating in the proceedings as such. The purpose is to ensure that victims are not prevented from attending the trial and seeing justice done, due to their own financial limitations. Identification of vulnerable victims : victims should be treated in an individual manner and that a consistent mechanism is established to identify vulnerable victims who may require special measures during criminal proceedings. All victims of crime are per se vulnerable and accordingly require sensitive and careful treatment. However, some victims are particularly vulnerable to further victimisation or intimidation by the accused or suspected person or his associates. In addition, some victims are particularly at risk of being further distressed or harmed by their involvement in criminal proceedings whether through the giving of evidence or through other forms of participation. Such victims require special measures in order to minimise the likelihood of further harm occurring. The proposed Directive provides that the vulnerability of victims to such harm be determined by the personal characteristics of the victim and by the nature or type of crime a victim has suffered. The majority of children and persons with disabilities are at particular risk of harm due to their personal characteristics. As a group they can immediately be identified as vulnerable and in the majority of cases in need of special measures. Victims within other categories based on the nature or type of crime, such as victims of sexual violence, including exploitation, and victims of human trafficking are also in most cases vulnerable to further victimisation during proceedings. At the same time, the proposal recognises that victims are individuals who react in different ways to a crime and have different needs and vulnerabilities. Thus a victim may be vulnerable despite not falling into a specific vulnerable victim category. An individual assessment mechanism is therefore to be established to ensure that all vulnerable victims are identified and properly protected. Such an approach can be crucial in facilitating a victim’s recovery and ensuring they are provided with the right assistance and protection during proceedings and afterwards. It maximises the ability to prevent secondary and repeat victimisation and intimidation and to enable the victim to effectively access justice. Nevertheless, such an approach must be carried out to an extent proportionate to the likelihood that criminal proceedings will be instituted and that specific measures will be required by the victim. In particular the severity of the crime and the degree of apparent harm suffered by the victim provides a useful indication of the extent of any particular individual assessment. The individual assessment should determine a victim’s needs during proceedings and any requirements for referral to victim support services. Those public officials who first come into contact with a victim when a crime is reported should be trained and should have access to appropriate guidance, tools or protocols to enable them to carry out assessments of the needs of victims in a consistent manner. Individual assessments should consider any factors which may increase the likelihood of a victim suffering further victimisation or intimidation during proceedings. In particular, the following factors should be taken into account: age, gender and gender identity, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, state of health, disability, relationship to or dependence on the suspected or accused person. Victims of terrorism require particular attention in any assessment given the varying nature of such acts ranging from acts of mass terrorism to targeted terrorism against individuals. Right to avoidance of contact between victim and offender : this provision mirrors the approach taken in the 2001 Framework Decision with a view to ensuring that where a victim must attend a venue as a result of their participation in criminal proceedings, appropriate steps should be taken to ensure the victim does not have to come into contact with accused or suspected persons. This could be achieved by various means such as establishing separate waiting areas, and controlling the arrival of victims and the accused. Best practice and guidance offered to public officials can also act as an important source of information on how to assist in avoiding contact. Right to protection of victims during questioning in criminal investigations :the proposal aims toprevent secondary victimisation by ensuring that the victim is interviewed as early as possible and that interaction with authorities should be as easy as possible whilst limiting the number of unnecessary interactions the victim has with them. Decisions on when to carry out any interviews should as far as possible take account of the victim’s needs as well as any urgency in relation to the gathering of evidence. Victims may be accompanied by a trusted person of their choice. Only in exceptional circumstances should this possibility be limited and then only in relation to a specific person. The victim should then be permitted to be accompanied by another person of their choice. Right of protection of vulnerable victims including children during criminal proceedings : a series of measures aim to ensure that when victims have been identified as being vulnerable to further victimisation or intimidation, appropriate measures are taken to help prevent such harm. Such measures should be available throughout criminal proceedings whether during the initial investigative or prosecutorial phase or during the trial itself. The measures necessary will vary according to the stage of proceedings. During criminal investigation, minimum levels of protection are required in relation to any interviews with the victim. These should be carried out in a sensitive manner and officials should have received appropriate training to this end. To this end, it may be necessary, according to the vulnerability of the victim, that interviews are only carried out in appropriate premises. This may mean premises which allow for video interviews or simply where furniture for example is adapted for children or persons with disabilities. Vulnerable victims can find the interview process highly distressing, particularly where the crime is of a very personal nature. Establishing trust with the interviewer can be important and may only happen over a period of time. For this reason, this article requires that in most cases a vulnerable victim is to be interviewed by the same person. Exceptions are permitted for reasons of good administration, such as an urgent need to interview someone else or the unavailability of the usual interviewer. For similar reasons, in cases of sexual violence, victims should have the right to be interviewed by a person of the same gender. During the trial itself, protection from intimidation, whether intentional or not, is also a relevant factor when determining appropriate protection measures. This proposal establishes minimum measures for this purpose as well as to minimise the distress of, in particular, testifying. Measures to enable the victim to avoid visual contact with the defendant are established as well as measures to exclude members of the public and press. In particular, in order to ensure that the fundamental rights of an accused or suspected person are respected, the decision on whether such measures are to be taken is left to judicial discretion. However, the fact that a victim is a child, a person with a disability, a victim of sexual violence or of human trafficking combined with the individual assessment should provide a strong indication of the need for a protection measure. Given the particular vulnerabilities of children, additional measures should also be made available and utilised in normal circumstances. Interviews may be videotaped and used as evidence in court and that in appropriate cases, where a child does not have a representative, the judicial authority should appoint one. Training of practitioners : it is provided to establish training requirements for public officials who come into contact with victims. Training should cover issues which will assist officials to treat victims in a respectful manner, to identify protection needs and to provide them with appropriate information to help them cope with proceedings and access their rights. Such training should cover issues such as awareness of the negative effects of crime on victims and the risk of causing secondary victimisation, skills and knowledge, including special measures and techniques, required to assist victims and minimise any trauma to the victim in particular from secondary victimisation, recognising and preventing intimidation, threats and harm to victims, the availability of services providing information and support specific to the needs of victims and the means of accessing these services. Additionally, it is ensured that those providing victim support or restorative justice services should also be trained to an appropriate level such that they treat victims in a respectful and impartial manner and provide their services to professional standards. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an environment marked by the emergence of new threats, such as hybrid and cyber-attacks, and the return of more conventional dangers, EU citizens and their political leaders agree that the EU should collectively take more responsibility for its security. The defence sector is largely fragmented across national borders , with considerable duplication, resulting in inefficiencies that prevent economies of scale. At the same time, the cost of defence equipment and in particular R&D costs have increased, while cooperation between Member States on investment in R&D and defence equipment has remained limited. In 2015, only 16% of defence equipment was procured through European collaborative procurement. In June 2017, the Commission adopted a communication launching the European Defence Fund consisting of 'windows' for research and for capability. The communication was accompanied by a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing the European defence industrial development programme under the capability window. A two-step approach was proposed, involving: an initial test period under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework during which a preparatory action on defence research supports collaborative defence research, while the proposed European defence industrial development programme shall co-finance collaborative development projects; and a dedicated fund under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework scaling up the funding for collaborative research in innovative defence products and technologies and for subsequent stages of the development cycle, including the development of prototypes. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - concerns the establishment of the European defence fund under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 with a view to fostering the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European defence industry and technological base and thus contributing to the strategic autonomy of the Union. The new fund shall promote cooperation between Member States and contribute to cost savings in the production of interoperable and advanced defence technologies and equipment. Its objective shall be: support collaborative research projects that could significantly boost the performance of future capabilities, aiming at maximising innovation and introducing new defence products and technologies, including disruptive ones; support collaborative development projects of defence products and technologies consistent with defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It shall contribute to greater efficiency of defence spending within the Union, achieving greater economies of scale, reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication and as such reducing the fragmentation of defence products and technologies throughout the Union. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation shall enable the Commission to set up a financing programme, implemented mainly through grants awarded following annual calls for proposals. Cross-border participation of SMEs and mid-cap companies shall be encouraged by offering higher financing rates. To be eligible, actions shall, in principle, be carried out in cooperation between at least three legal entities based in at least three different Member States and/or associated countries. Furthermore, the EU shall only co-finance the development of common prototypes if Member States commit themselves to buying the final product. Once assessed as eligible, a 'PESCO bonus', in the form of a higher funding rate, shall be granted to eligible permanent structured cooperation in defence projects. The fund shall also take into account defence activities implemented through the European peace facility, an off-budget instrument proposed outside the multi-annual financial framework. Proposed budget : the Fund shall have an overall budget of EUR 13 billion (at current prices) for the period 2021-2027, of which: Up to 5% of the financial envelope shall be devoted to support disruptive technologies for defence."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (CRA Regulation) entered into full application on 7 December 2010. It requires credit rating agencies (CRAs) to comply with rigorous rules of conduct in order to mitigate possible conflicts of interest, ensure high quality and sufficient transparency of ratings and the rating process. The Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) No 513/2011 which entrusted the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with exclusive supervisory powers over CRAs registered in the EU in order to centralise and simplify their registration and supervision at European level. However, a number of issues related to credit rating activities and the use of ratings have not been sufficiently addressed in the existing CRA Regulation. One of these issues is the risk of overreliance on credit ratings by financial market participants, including UCITS and AIFS who do not necessarily conducting their own assessments of the creditworthiness of issuers of such debt instruments. The European Commission pointed to these open issues in its Communication of 2 June 2010 on Regulating financial services for sustainable growth, and announced the need for a targeted review of the CRA Regulation. On 8 June 2011, the European Parliament adopted a non-legislative resolution on CRAs, which supports the need to enhance the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies and to take measures to reduce the risk of over-reliance of ratings. The European Council of 23 October 2011 concluded that progress is needed on reducing overreliance on credit ratings. On the international level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued in October 2010 principles to reduce authorities’ and financial institutions’ reliance on external ratings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment has been produced for this proposal. It can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/agencies/index_en.htm. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53 (1) TFEU. CONTENT: in order to reduce the risk of over-reliance of managers of UCITS and AIFs on credit ratings, the Commission proposes to introduce amendments to Directive 2009/65/EC on the coordination of law, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers. The Commission is presenting in parallel a proposal of Regulation for the amendment of the CRA Regulation. Amendment of Directive 2009/65/EC on UCITS : the proposal amends Article 51 of Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the risk management process: §  it introduces a requirement for the management or investment company not to solely or mechanistically rely on external credit ratings for assessing the creditworthiness of the UCITS assets. External credit ratings may be used as one factor among others in this process but shall not prevail; §  it proposes corresponding amendments to the existing powers of the Commission to adopt delegated acts with a view to specifying the provisions of Article 51(1) of 2009/65/EC. Amendment of Directive 2011/61/EC on managers of AIFs: the proposal amends Article 15 of Directive 2011/61/EU as regards the risk management systems: §  it introduces a requirement for the AIF Manager not to solely or mechanistically rely on external credit ratings for assessing the creditworthiness of the AIF assets. External credit ratings may be used as one factor among others in this process but shall not prevail; §  it proposes corresponding amendments to the existing powers of the Commission to adopt delegated acts with a view to specifying the provisions of Article 15(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Samoa were opened on 19 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 15 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andSamoa on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Samoa when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Samoa to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Samoa may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Samoa remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Samoa reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Samoa to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."
5231EP7,"""""Programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE)""""",0.649,0.813,0.789,0.419,0.364,0.807,0.831,0.286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE programme) covering the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. . BACKGROUND: in its Communication entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” (the MFF Communication), in which it recognised the climate change challenge, the Commission stated that it intends to increase the climate related proportion of the Union budget to at least 20% with contribution from different policies. The proposed Regulation should contribute to that goal. The Commission has decided to address environment and climate action as an integral part of all the main instruments and interventions. This 'mainstreaming' approach implies that environmental and climate objectives need to be reflected in all main instruments to ensure that they contribute to building a low-carbon, resource efficient and climate resilient economy. However, the main Union funding instruments do not address all environmental and climate specific needs . Furthermore, implementation of environmental and climate legislation remains uneven and inadequate across the Union. This situation requires new and more efficient ways of implementing legislation, as well as development and dissemination of best practices across the Union. For this reason, and in addition to mainstreaming, the Commission proposes to continue the LIFE Programme currently regulated by the LIFE+ Regulation, and define a more strategic approach with a clearer focus on activities and sectors where LIFE could make a difference. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on the recommendations from the evaluations and the Court of Auditors aiming to increase the effectiveness and added value of LIFE, while incorporating stakeholders' main concerns and suggestions. The options to establish priorities analysed in the Impact Assessment try to strike a balance between the need for stability for potential applicants and the need to better focus on Union policy needs. Three scenarios were analysed: (i) status quo, with a pure bottom-up approach partially corrected by the concentration of earmarked resources on climate action; (ii) a flexible top-down approach for all types of projects; (iii) combining the top-down approach for integrated projects and the bottom-up approach for all other types of projects. The preferred option is the flexible top-down approach. The Impact Assessment analysed options for areas on which Integrated Projects should focus, concluding that Natura 2000, water, waste and air were the sectors with the highest potential for success and where more environmental benefits could be obtained. Lastly, a strong emphasis was put on simplification to build on the changes undertaken by LIFE+, such as the use of e-proposals. As part of the simplification measures, options for externalisation of most of the management tasks to an existing Executive Agency were also analysed, including full externalisation and a hybrid option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal for a new regulation aims to establish the LIFE programme with two sub-programmes, one on the environment and the other on climate action. The objective of the LIFE Programme is to be a catalyst for promoting implementation and integration of environmental and climate objectives in other policies and Member State practice. Special emphasis is placed on better governance, as it is inextricably linked to improving implementation. The proposal discusses the main points of the new programme. (1) Shift from a pure bottom-up approach to a flexible top-down approach: work programmes valid for at least two years will be drawn up by the Commission in consultation with the Member States. These will cover, for example, priorities, allocation of resources between types of funding, and targets for the period. The priorities will not be exhaustive in order to allow applicants to submit proposals in other areas as well and to incorporate new ideas and react to new challenges. The Commission will be assisted by the Committee for the LIFE Programme for the Environment and Climate Action, which will have a dual nature with different chairs and different compositions depending on whether the issues dealt with are related to the sub-programme for Environment or the sub-programme for Climate Action. (2) Creation of a new type of projects, “Integrated Projects”: these aim to improve the implementation of environmental and climate policy and their integration into other policies, especially by ensuring a coordinated mobilisation of other Union, national and private funds towards environmental or climate objectives. Integrated Projects will operate on a large territorial scale (in particular regional, multi- regional, or national, and in a cross-sectoral manner). ·  Integrated Projects for the sub-programme for Environment will primarily focus on the implementation of plans and programmes related to the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Water Framework Directive, and waste and air quality legislation. ·  For the sub-programme for Climate Action, Integrated Projects may focus on the implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies and action plans. (3) Clearer definition of the activities funded for each priority area . ·  The sub-programme for Environment consists of three priority areas: (i) the priority area Biodiversity extends its support to developing best practices for wider biodiversity challenges while keeping its focus on Natura2000; (ii) the priority area of Environment and Resource Efficiency shifts its focus towards implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation; (iii) the priority area Governance and Information replaces the former LIFE+ Information and Communication component and will more actively promote the dissemination of knowledge for decision-making and the development of best practices. ·  In accordance with the Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050, the sub-programme for Climate Action should support efforts contributing to three specific priority areas: (i) Climate Change Mitigation, (ii) Climate Change Adaptation and (iii) Climate Governance and Information. The Commission will ensure synergies between the LIFE Programme and other Union instruments, e.g. it may exploit research and innovation results produced by Horizon 2020. (4) Types of funding : the LIFE Programme should cover all types of funding required to address its objectives and priorities: (i) action grants to finance projects; (ii) operating grants for NGOs and other entities of Union interest which are primarily active in the area of environment or climate; (iii) option of using financial instruments; (iv) encouraging the use of green public procurement when implementing action grants. (5) Enlarged territorial scope : the LIFE Programme (i) allows activities outside the Union in exceptional cases and under specific conditions as well as in countries participating in the programme from outside the Union; (ii) provides a legal basis for cooperation with international organisations of interest to environmental and climate policy that do not necessarily fall within the scope of Union external action. (6) Simplification : the LIFE Programme will continue improving IT systems to accelerate and facilitate the electronic submission of applications. In order to further facilitate the participation of small stakeholders, such as SMEs or NGOs, special attention will be paid to clear, easily readable and unified application forms, deadlines to allow enough time for submission of applications, assistance with the preparation of applications, and publicly available deadlines to reject or award the project proposal accompanied with clear reasons for rejection. The proposal also increases the use of flat rates and lump-sums to ease the application and reporting processes, and will lighten reporting requirements for Integrated Projects. Certain costs will no longer be considered eligible (e.g., VAT), and the eligibility of other costs, such as personnel costs related to permanent staff not specifically recruited for the project, might be limited or excluded. In order to maintain similar levels of support for projects financed by way of action grants as in the LIFE+ Regulation, the co-financing rates should be increased from presently 50% to 70% and in specific cases to 80%, while still ensuring the same leverage effect as today. The higher rate of 80% would apply to Integrated Projects. (7) Central management : the LIFE Programme should remain centrally managed to maximise policy links, quality of interventions, sound financial management and stable resources, and to ensure that findings of LIFE projects are taken up in shaping Union policy. This is considered as an essential asset by the European Parliament, Member States and stakeholders. The Commission will explore the possibility of delegating the selection and monitoring tasks to the European Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation, while keeping the governance of the LIFE Programme within the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial envelope for the LIFE Programme for the period 2014-2020 expressed in current prices is EUR 3 618 million. Of this amount: ·  EUR 2 713.5 million is allocated to the sub-programme for Environment (half of the resources dedicated to projects financed by way of action grants shall be allocated to support the conservation of nature and biodiversity); ·  EUR 904.5 million is allocated to the sub-programme for Climate Action. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: effective protection of the EU's external borders is an essential precondition for managing migration flows and ensuring internal security. Strong external borders are also what allow the EU to maintain a Schengen area without internal border controls. Financial support from the Union budget is essential for the implementation of integrated European border management as implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard, set up by Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In order to respond to increased migratory and security challenges, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a new integrated border management fund under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. This new fund aims to provide enhanced support to Member States with a view to securing the Union’s common external borders, with an envelope of EUR 9.31 billion (in current prices). A five-fold increase as compared to the current multiannual financial framework for the overall envelope for border management is foreseen for the next period. Within that framework, the proposed integrated border management fund shall be composed of two instruments: an instrument for financial support for border management and visa and an instrument for financial support for customs control equipment. This proposal concerns only the instrument for border management and visa. A separate proposal covering the instrument for customs control equipment is presented by the Commission in parallel. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the instrument for financial support for border management and visa as part of the integrated border management fund. It lays down the objectives of the instrument, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Objective : the instrument shall ensure strong and effective European integrated border management at the external borders while safeguarding the free movement of persons within it, in full compliance with the Union’s commitments on fundamental rights, thereby contributing to guaranteeing a high level of security in the Union. Its specific objectives are to: support effective European integrated border management at the external borders implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard as a shared responsibility of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and of the national authorities responsible for border management, to facilitate legitimate border crossings, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and cross-border crime and to effectively manage migratory flows; support the common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel and prevent migratory and security risks: the instrument shall contribute to the improvement of the efficiency of visa processing in terms of detecting and assessing security and irregular migration risks, as well as facilitating visa procedures for bona fide travellers. In particular, the instrument shall deliver financial assistance to support digitalisation of visa processing with the objective to provide fast, secure and client-friendly visa procedures for the benefit of both visa applicants and consulates. Priority shall be given to supporting actions with a European dimension. Support to Member States : in addition to a basic amount of EUR 5 million that is envisaged to be allocated to Member States at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of Member States shall be allocated based on a distribution key that shall reflect the needs and pressure experienced by Member States in the two areas covered by this instrument (border management and visas). Funding shall be distributed based on the following weighing: 30% for external land borders, 35% for external sea borders, 20% for airports and 15% for consular offices. A mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for a number of priorities defined in Commission financing decisions. The instrument shall furthermore maintain support for the functioning of the Special Transit Scheme implemented by Lithuania, in line with the EU’s obligations, compensating Lithuania for the transit visa fees it foregoes and additional costs it incurs as a result of the facilitated transit document (FTD) and facilitated rail transit document (FRTD) scheme, such as the costs of replacing and upgrading equipment and IT systems, and training and operational costs. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 8.01 billion (in current prices) for the instrument for border management and visa for the 2021-2027 period. Implementation shall be by means of shared, direct or indirect management. The global resources shall be allocated as follows: EUR 4.81 billion (around 60%) for measures taken by Member States in border management and visa policy, including EUR 157.2 million for the special transit scheme applied by Lithuania; EUR 3.20 billion (40%) for the thematic facility for targeted support actions to Member States, projects with a European dimension and urgent needs."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EEC) N° 1601/91 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatised wines, aromatised wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails  and Commission Regulation (EC) No 122/94 have proved successful in regulating the aromatised wines, aromatised wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails, hereinafter called “aromatised wine products”. However, in the light of technologic innovation, market developments and evolving consumer expectations it is necessary to update the rules applicable to the definition, description, presentation, labelling and protection of geographical indications of certain aromatised wine products, while taking into account traditional production methods. This proposal replaces Commission proposal which the Commission decided to withdraw in the 2011 Commission Work Programme which has been communicated to the other institutions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. The main European producers and national organisations were consulted informally and did not expect significant impacts. A consensus exists among the producers of aromatised wine products to keep the same framework and similar rules; only minor technical adjustments seem to be necessary. Those were communicated to the Commission services by the representatives of the sector. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal simplifies the existing rules by introducing limited changes to improve the readability and clarity of the rules on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products as well as on the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products. Alignment with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) : one of the main objectives of the present proposal consists in aligning Council Regulation (EEC) N° 1601/91 on new comitology rules: the objectives and principles and other essential elements regarding the definition, the description, the presentation, the labelling and the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products are determined by the Legislator; the Commission should be able to adopt, by means of a delegated act, in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU, the production processes, the methods of analysis, the necessary amendments of the definitions, the requirements, the restrictions, the sales denominations and the descriptions, the necessary rules for the geographical indications and the necessary rules for exchange of information; the Legislator should grant the Commission the power to adopt implementing acts, in accordance with Article 291(2) of the Treaty, specifically with regard to the uniform application of the rules on aromatised wine products related to geographical indications, to administrative and physical checks and to exchange of information. Other amendments : the proposal does not change the scope of the existing rules for the sector, and has no significant impact as it corresponds to an adaptation to obligations already taken on by the Union. In particular, the proposal: enhances applicability, readability and clarity of the Union legislation on aromatised wine products; introduces a well defined quality policy for aromatised wine products based on the present definitions of products; updates certain sales denominations, in the light of the possibility to increase the level of wine instead of directly adding alcohol, and so ensuring that the consumer is properly informed; adapts the Union rules to new technical requirements; adapts the Union rules to WTO requirements, including the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement (TRIPs agreement). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in line with its flagship initiative ‘ Resource-efficient Europe ”, the White Paper entitled “ Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a Competitive and Resource Efficient Transport System ” called for breaking the oil dependence of transport and set a target of 60% greenhouse gas emissions reduction from transport by 2050. The Commission therefore decided to develop a sustainable alternative fuels strategy, including also the appropriate associated infrastructure. The Commission’s communication “ Clean Power for Transport: A European alternative fuels strategy ” evaluates the main alternative fuel options available to substitute oil. The main alternative fuel options are electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, natural gas (in the forms of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), or GasTo-Liquid (GTL)), and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Lack of alternative fuel infrastructure and of the common technical specifications for the vehicle-infrastructure interface is considered a major obstacle to the market introduction of alternative fuels and consumer acceptance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment that accompanies the proposal investigated the situation with infrastructure for the main alternative fuel options. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims at ensuring the setting in place of alternative fuel infrastructure and the implementation of common technical specifications for this infrastructure in the Union. the introduction of common technical specifications and the establishment of minimum infrastructure for alternative fuels for transport, i.e. electricity, natural gas (CNG and LNG) and hydrogen, to ensure the market uptake by consumers of alternative fuels and the further development and deployment of the technology by industry; Member States to draw up national policy frameworks for the market development of alternative fuels and their infrastructure; each Member State to establish a minimum number of recharging points for electric vehicles by each Member State, with 10% of them being publicly accessible; the establishment, on the territory of Member States where there are already hydrogen refuelling points, the build-up of a sufficient number of points to allow hydrogen-powered vehicles to circulate throughout the national territory; that LNG refuelling points shall be built in all maritime and inland waterway ports, as well as routes on the Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Core Network and defines the common technical specifications to be met by this infrastructure; that common information on fuels and their compatibility with vehicles be made available to the consumer at the pumps in all refuelling points, in vehicle manuals, and on the vehicles themselves. BUDGETARY IMPACT: only limited costs related to the follow-up on the implementation of the Directive will arise for the EU budget. The total impact on expenditure (operational and administrative expenditure) is estimated at EUR 1 329 080 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the years preceding the crisis, low financing costs fuelled misallocation of resources, often to less productive uses, feeding unsustainable levels of consumption, housing bubbles and accumulation of external and internal debt in some Member States. The emergence of large macroeconomic imbalances, including wide and persistent divergences in competitiveness trends, proved highly damaging to the European Union, and in particular to the euro, when the crisis struck. It is therefore important to develop a new structured procedure for prevention and correction of adverse macroeconomic imbalances in every Member State. In its Communication and report on « EMU@10: successes and challenges after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union ” the Commission stressed, in particular, the need to broaden economic surveillance in order to detect and address macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage. The Europe 2020 strategy calls for the development of a specific policy framework for the euro area to tackle broader macroeconomic imbalances. Overall, the Task Force on economic governance, chaired by the President of the European Council, agreed that macroeconomic surveillance should function alongside the budget surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact. This proposal is part of legislative package comprising six texts which seeks to strengthen the pact by improving its provisions in the light of experience, not least of the crisis: 1) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1466/97); 2) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1467/97); 3) A Regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area; 4) A new Council Directive on requirements for the budgetary framework of the Member States; 5) A new Regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; 6) A Regulation on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 121 (6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the mechanism for the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances is made up of two draft proposals for regulations. This first proposal sketches out the excessive imbalance procedure (EIP), while the second proposal focuses on the associated enforcement measures. The EIP is a completely new element of the economic surveillance process. It comprises a regular assessment of risks of imbalances, including an alert mechanism, coupled with rules designed to allow corrective action in case of adverse macroeconomic imbalances extending beyond fiscal policy. The EIP applies to every Member State. The proposal provides for a regular assessment of risks of imbalances, based on a scoreboard using economic indicators. The Commission may launch in-depth reviews for Member States at risk that will identify the underlying problems. For Member States with severe imbalances or imbalances that put at risk the functioning of EMU, the Council may adopt recommendations and open an ""excessive imbalance procedure (EIP)"". Following the opening of an EIP, the Member State concerned will be under an obligation to adopt a corrective action plan within a specific timeframe, to set out a roadmap of implementing policy measures. Within two months after submission of a corrective action plan and on the basis of a Commission report, the Council shall assess the corrective action plan. If considered sufficient, on the basis of a Commission proposal, the Council shall adopt an opinion, endorsing it. If the actions taken or envisaged in the corrective action plan or their timetable for implementation are considered insufficient to implement the recommendations, the Council shall, on the basis of a Commission proposal, invite the Member State to amend its corrective action plan within a new deadline. The Member State concerned will be required to provide regular reports and will be monitored until the closure of the EIP. If the Member State has not taken the appropriate action, the EIP will be continued. The Council will have to adopt revised recommendations along with a new deadline by which to complete its corrective action. For euro-area Member States, the enforcement mechanism could ultimately lead to sanctions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Medicines Agency has been established by Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, which has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In accordance with the Decision of 29 October 1993 taken by common agreement between the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting at Head of State and Government level, on the location of the seats of certain bodies and departments of the European Communities and of Europol, the European Medicines Agency has its seat in London, United Kingdom. Following the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to leave the Union, the 27 remaining Member States, in the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50), selected Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as the new seat for the European Medicines Agency. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 in order to confirm the new seat of the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Agency should occupy its new seat from the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom or from 30 March 2019, whichever is the earlier. It is proposed that the Regulation shall enter into force as a matter of urgency in order to give the Agency sufficient time to relocate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the relocation of the Agency will have budgetary implications, in particular in view of the costs related to the early termination of its current rental contract in London as a consequence of the withdrawal, the costs related to the move itself and the costs related to the installation in the new premises in Amsterdam. As set out in the negotiation directives of the Council of 22 May 2017, the United Kingdom should fully cover the specific costs related to the withdrawal process, such as the relocation of the agencies based in the United Kingdom. Some of the relocation costs (e.g. costs related to the move itself) may have to be pre-financed by the EU budget prior to the final financial settlement. If necessary, the Commission will submit the relevant proposals to the European Parliament and the Council in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure for 2019 and, if necessary, for 2018. In addition, the costs related to the installation in the new premises will also be presented in the context of the building procedure set out in Article 203 of the Financial Regulation, which requires prior approval from the European Parliament and the Council before contracts related to building projects are concluded. This procedure is expected to be launched as soon as possible (at the latest in early 2018)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 lays down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue, including rules on vaccination. In the past, only sporadic incursions of certain serotypes of the bluetongue virus were recorded in the Union. Those incursions mainly occurred in the southern parts of the Union. However, after the adoption of Directive 2000/75/EC, and particularly after the introduction into the Union of bluetongue virus serotypes 1 and 8 in the years 2006 and 2007, the bluetongue virus has become more widespread in the Union, with the potential of becoming endemic in certain areas. It has therefore become difficult to control the spread of that virus. The rules on vaccination against bluetongue laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC are based on experience of the use of so-called ""modified live vaccines"", or ""live attenuated vaccines"" that were the only vaccines available when that Directive was adopted. In recent years, as a result of new technology, ""inactivated vaccines"" against bluetongue have become available, which do not pose that risk to unvaccinated animals. It is now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for bluetongue control and the prevention of clinical disease in the Union. Under the current rules, the use of vaccines against bluetongue is prohibited outside ""restricted zones"" where the disease has appeared and where animal movement has been restricted. PREFERRED OPTION AND ASSESSMENT OF ITS IMPACTS: the Commission considers that the amendment of the legislation is necessary to reflect the technological progress in the field of vaccine development. The current obstacles for preventive vaccination outside areas subjected to animal movement restrictions are not necessary when modern safe ""inactivated vaccines"" are used. The proposed amendment will facilitate decision making on bluetongue control strategies on the basis of the specific situation within the Member States without unnecessary intervention by the Union. LEGAL BASIS: the legal basis of Directive 2000/75/EC is the second indent of Article 15 of Council Directive 92/119/EEC of 17 December 1992 introducing general Community measures for the control of certain animal diseases and specific measures relating to swine vesicular disease. This article provides that the Council may adopt specific provisions relating to the control and eradication measures for any of the animal diseases listed in Annex I to the Directive, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission. Since the basic act providing for this legal basis is still in force, the legality of the powers vested in the Council in this act are not affected by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and these powers remain solely with the Council. CONTENT: in order to ensure the better control of the spread of the bluetongue virus and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by that disease, it is appropriate to amend the current rules on vaccination laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC in order to take account of the recent technological developments in vaccine production. The proposed amendments should make the rules on vaccination more flexible and also take into account the fact that inactivated vaccines are now available, which can also be successfully used outside areas subjected to animal movement restrictions. T he use of live attenuated vaccines should not be excluded provided that appropriate precautionary measures are taken, as their use might still be necessary under certain circumstances, such as following the introduction of a new bluetongue virus serotype against which inactivated vaccines may not be available. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Ukraine is a priority partner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The European Union and Ukraine negotiated in 2007-2011 an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which was signed by both parties on 27 June 2014. The European Union and Ukraine are to establish a free trade area over a transitional period of a maximum of 10 years starting from the entry into force of the Association Agreement. Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine was to apply until Title IV of the Association Agreement enters into force or is applied provisionally. It was intended that this Regulation (would cease to apply on 1 November 2014 at the latest. In light of the unprecedented security, political and economic challenges faced by Ukraine, and in order to support its economy, it was decided to anticipate the implementation of the Schedule of concessions set out in Annex I-A to the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine by means of the autonomous trade preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014. In view of the challenges Ukraine still faces, the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 shall be extended. CONTENT: in order to support the political and economic stability of Ukraine, the European Commission would propose the extension of the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31 December 2015. For the purpose of predictability, the customs duties and access to tariff quotas should following the extension remain the same as for 2014. The autonomous trade preferences provided for by Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 should have full respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law, promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence, as well as countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The proposal ensures that it is appropriate to introduce the possibility to temporarily suspend the preferences in case of failure to respect the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine. BUDGETARYIMPLICATION: the European Union will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to EUR 487 million (gross) annually. However, those figures are estimates, having regard to the political and economic situation of Ukraine and can change."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Copernicus is the new name of the European Earth Observation Programme, GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) which was established as an EU programme by the GMES Regulation (EU) No 911/2010. It covers all the activities for ensuring an uninterrupted provision of accurate and reliable data and information on environmental issues and security matters to users in charge of policy making, implementation and monitoring, in the EU and its Member States. Copernicus aims at providing Europe with a continuous, independent and reliable access to observation data and information. Responsibility for funding the exploitation and the renewal of space infrastructure developed with EU and intergovernmental funds cannot be optimally achieved by individual Member States because of the costs incurred. For the services with a pan-European or global coverage, Member States cannot sufficiently achieve the objectives of the proposed action, as the inputs from different Member States have to be aggregated at European level. The provision of other services (e.g. emergency maps or thematic land monitoring maps of a more limited geographical scope) can be better achieved at EU level for two reasons. 1. A more coherent and centralised management of input data, from space based or in situ sensors will allow for economies of scale; 2. An uncoordinated provision of Earth observation services at Member State level would lead to duplications and would render the monitoring of the implementation of EU environmental legislation on the basis of transparent and objective criteria difficult or even impossible. Action at EU level thus leads to a clear added value. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has carried out a consultation process since 2006 and the progressive implementation of the GMEs since 2010. Various consultations have confirmed the interest and the need for the Copernicus programme. An impact assessment was undertaken in 2011 and the main conclusions were published in SEC(2011)867 final of 28 June 2011, which accompanies the Commission proposal o n the Multiannual Financial Framework. The impact assessment has now been adapted to take account of the financial issues and the ownership transfer. In view of an ownership transfer, options will need to be assessed, taking account relevant factors including the operation of the satellites; legal ownership of the data; data access conditions; and the value of the assets. These options will only be considered if disadvantages of EU ownership seem to outweigh its advantages. The option of a data purchase scheme could also be considered. LEGAL BASIS: Article 189 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal focuses on the following main aspects: 1. Change of name into Copernicus; 2. Governance of GMES in its operational phase, with a view to allowing the Commission to delegate activities to a number of operators; 3. Funding over 2014-2020. Change of name : the acronym 'GMES' should be changed to 'Copernicus' in order to facilitate the communication with the public at large. The Commission has registered the trademark so that it can be used by the Union institutions and licensed to other interested users, in particular the providers of core services. Objectives : the objectives of the Copernicus programme are to provide accurate and reliable information in the field of the environment and security, tailored to the needs of users and supporting other Union’s policies, in particular relating to : the internal market, transport, environment, energy, civil protection, cooperation with third countries, humanitarian aid. Capacity and infrastructure : in order to attain its objectives, the Copernicus programme should rely on an autonomous Union’s capacity for space-borne observations and provide operational services in the field of environment, civil protection and security. It should also make use of the available in-situ data provided, namely, by the Member States. The provision of operational services depends on the well-functioning and safety of the Copernicus space component. Scope of the Copernicus services : the Copernicus services shall include: 1. Operational services: air quality monitoring systems; marine monitoring service which shall provide information on the state and dynamics of physical ocean and marine ecosystems for the global ocean and the European regional areas; land monitoring service (soil, water, forests as well as in general implementation of environment, agriculture, development, energy, urban planning, infrastructure and transport policies; climate change monitoring service (provision of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), climate analyses and projections at temporal and spatial scales relevant to adaptation and mitigation strategies for the various Union’s sectorial and societal benefit areas); emergency response service shall provide information for emergency response in relation to different types of disasters, including meteorological hazards, geophysical hazards, deliberate and accidental man-made disasters; security service shall provide information in particular for border and maritime surveillance,risk assessment and early warning systems. 2. Development activities consisting in improving the quality and performance of operational services, including their evolution and adaptation; 3. Support activities consisting in measures to promote the use of operational services by users and downstream applications, as well as communication and dissemination activities. Governance : the Commission shall have the overall responsibility for the programme. It shall define the priorities and objectives of the programme and oversee its implementation, in particular with respect to the cost, schedule and performance. Taking into account the partnership dimension of Copernicus and in order to avoid duplication of technical expertise, the implementation of the programme should be delegated to entities with the appropriate technical and professional capacity. The Commission may entrust, in part or in full, where duly justified by the special nature of the action and specific expertise of the Union body the implementation tasks to competent Union bodies. Among such agencies are: the European Environment Agency (EEA); the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX); the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA); the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC). Other Copernicus operators : the selection of entities (the “operators”) to whom the Commission may entrust implementation tasks, should follow a transparent procedure based on justified on objective grounds and shall not give rise to a conflict of interests. Given the particular nature of the tasks involved, an ad-hoc procedure based on a call for expression of interest was chosen to identify the potential operators best suited to be entrusted with indirect management of the Copernicus programme. The operators of the Copernicus programme should be subject to supervision by the Commission, whilst enjoying the necessary autonomy to implement the tasks they were entrusted with. They should submit an annual work programme to the Commission with an annual implementation report. Ownership : the question of ownership of the Copernicus space component assets is important and cannot be considered in isolation from the rights and responsibilities that such ownership confers upon the owner. The owner has the fullest possible rights including the right of use, transfer and disposal. The Union or a specifically designated body or fund shall be the owner of all tangible and intangible assets created or developed under the Copernicus programme subject to agreements concluded with third parties, wherever appropriate, with regard to existing ownership rights. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts to establish the terms and conditions of any subsequent transfer of ownership from the Union. Copernicus Data : Copernicus data and information shall be made available on a full, open and free-of-charge basis, subject to the following limitations: licensing conditions attached third party data and information; dissemination formats, characteristics and distribution means; security interests and external relations of the Union or its Member States; risk of disruption, for safety or technical reasons, of the system producing Copernicus data and information. Limitations and conditions of access and use have also been established. International cooperation : the Union, represented by the Commission, may enter into agreements with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries which are Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement; the candidate countries, as well as potential candidate countries; Switzerland, other third countries and international organisations. Third countries or international organisations may provide financial support or contributions in kind to the programme. Evaluation : by 30 June 2018 at the latest, an evaluation report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of all the tasks financed by the Copernicus programme at the level of their results and impacts and their European added value. Repeal : Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 is repealed in order to establish an appropriate framework for governance and funding and to ensure a fully operational Copernicus programme from 2014 onwards. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial statement accompanying this proposal for a Regulation sets out indicative budget appropriations, which are compatible with the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, with a maximum level of commitments of EUR 3,786 million, in 2011 prices, equivalent to EUR 4,291 million in current prices. Until the end of 2013, Copernicus is funded by the FP7 Space theme and the GMES and its Initial Operations programme. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU concerning: the establishment of the data requirements necessary for the operational services; the conditions and procedures as regards access to, registration and use of Copernicus data and information, including the formats, characteristic and dissemination means; the conditions and procedures for the transmission and use of satellite data transmitted to receiving stations not part of the Copernicus programme; the conditions and procedures for the archiving of Copernicus data and information; the specific technical criteria necessary to prevent the disruption of the Copernicus data and information system, including priority of access; the criteria for the restriction of dissemination of Copernicus data and information due to conflicting rights or security interests; the criteria for the performance of the security assessment. The Commission shall carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.When preparing and drawing up delegated acts, it should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: increasingly, investors are pursuing social goals and are not only seeking financial returns. In this way, a social investment market has been emerging in the Union, comprised in part by investment funds targeting social undertakings. According to the Global Enterprise Monitor 2009 report, between 3% and 7.5% of the workforce in selected EU Member States were employed in various forms of social businesses. Some estimates suggest social investments could grow rapidly to become a market well in excess of EUR 100 billion. Social businesses are almost exclusively SMEs and derive significant proportions of their funding from grants, whether from foundations, individuals or from the public sector. As businesses, however, their sustainable growth depends on drawing on a wider range of investments and financing sources. In this regard, the EU market for investment funds has begun to play a significant role, since a market for investment funds whose main objective is investing in social businesses has taken shape. In order to distinguish such targeted funds from wider social investment funds, these targeted funds are referred to as “social entrepreneurship funds” in this proposal. Evidence on regulatory and market failings shows two problems are limiting the growth of social entrepreneurship funds: (i) regulatory requirements at EU and national levels are not tailored to facilitate the raising of capital by these kinds of funds; (ii) social entrepreneurship funds are not flourishing across all Member States, but are currently geographically uneven in their distribution. Accordingly, it is necessary to lay down a common framework of rules regarding the use of the designation ""European Social Entrepreneurship Fund"", in particular on the composition of the portfolio of funds that operate under this designation, their eligible investment targets, the investment tools they may employ and the categories of investors that are eligible to invest in such funds by uniform rules in the Union. In the Single Market Act, the Commission undertook to put in train several measures to ensure EU social businesses can flourish, including by tackling such financing weaknesses. The current proposal is one initiative that delivers on that commitment. It forms part of the Commission's Social Business Initiative, which aims to tackle wider issues in this sector. It is complementary to the proposal on venture capital funds. Both proposals aim to achieve different goals and both proposals, if adopted, will coexist as autonomous legal acts in mutual independence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment identified two key problems: (1) information made available to investors pertaining to social undertakings, the investment policies and screening procedures followed by social entrepreneurship funds and the measurement of social impacts is either insufficient or not presented in a comparable manner; (2) regulatory approaches to the fundraising of organisations specialising in investments in social businesses were not sufficiently tailored to the specific needs of social entrepreneurship funds. The assessment identifies three key objectives: (i) improving the clarity and comparability of investment funds targeting social businesses; (ii) improving tools for assessing and analysing social impacts; and (iii) better reflecting the needs of social entrepreneurship funds in the rules applying to such funds across the Union. The impact assessment concluded in favour of a standalone framework for defining the funds and the rules applying to them, to facilitate national and cross border fund- raising including the development of a European 'brand' of social entrepreneurship funds supported by strong transparency measures. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 TFEU. CONTENT: the aim of the proposed Regulation is to create a legislative framework tailored to the needs of social undertakings, investors seeking to fund such undertakings, and the specialised investment funds that seek to mediate between the two. It aims to achieve a high level of clarity as to the characteristics that distinguish social entrepreneurship funds from the wider category of alternative investment funds. Only funds that comply with these characteristics shall be eligible to raise funds by virtue of the proposed European framework for social entrepreneurship funds. The proposed Regulation aims to addresses the problems identified by introducing: · uniform requirements for the managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Social Entrepreneurship Fund""; · requirements as to the investment portfolio, investment techniques and eligible undertakings that a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund may target; · uniform rules on which categories of investors a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund may target and on the internal organisation of the managers that market such qualifying funds. The proposed Regulation also takes the special characteristics of social undertakings into account. Social undertakings have the achievement of positive social impact as their principle objective. Therefore, this Regulation requires that a qualifying portfolio undertaking should have a measurable and positive social impact, use its profits to achieve its primary objective and that it is managed in an accountable and transparent way. As managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Social Entrepreneurship Fund"" will be subject to identical substantive rules across the EU, they will benefit from uniform requirements for registration and an EU-wide passport, which will help create a level playing field for all participants in the market for the funding of social entrepreneurs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no budgetary implications. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: an effective control system is essential to ensure that EU fisheries are managed in a sustainable manner, which in turn ensures the long-term viability of the EU fisheries sector and protects the livelihoods of EU fishermen. The measures establishing a Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) for ensuring compliance with rules of the CFP are provided for in four different legal acts: 1) the Fisheries Control Regulation; 2) the Regulation establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA); 3) the Regulation establishing a system to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU Regulation); and 4) the Regulation on the sustainable management of the external fishing fleets (SMEF). With the exception of the SMEF regulation, which was recently revised, the current Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) was designed prior to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and as such it is not fully coherent with it. In addition, the system reflects control strategies, methodologies and challenges of more than 10 years ago, and it is not equipped to effectively address current and future needs in terms of fisheries data and fleet control, to match the constant evolution of fishing practices and techniques and to take advantage of modern and more cost-effective control technologies and data exchange systems. The current system also does not reflect new and modern Union policies recently adopted, such as the plastic strategy, the digital single market strategy, and the international ocean governance. Several discussions and exchanges of view have taken place in the Council, in the Parliament, in the Administrative Board of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with Member States and with stakeholders since the publication of all these documents. Those discussions confirmed that there is unanimous agreement among the European Institutions and among direct stakeholders that the Fisheries Control System is not effective and efficient and that, as such, it is not entirely fit for purpose to sustain the achievements of the CFP objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option selected is targeted changes to the fisheries control system (in particular regulations on fisheries control, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the European Fisheries Control Agency). Positive environmental impacts of the preferred option would encompass: reduction of overfishing, elimination of discards at sea, healthier fish stocks and proper control of marine protected areas. Main socio-economic benefits include: increased wages and competitiveness of fishing industry, especially for the small fleet; promotion of job creation (especially in ICT); improved compliance with the CFP and equal treatment of fishers. CONTENT: the specific objectives of the proposed revision of the fisheries control regime are to: bridge the gaps with the CFP and with other EU policies; simplify the legislative framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burden; improve availability, reliability and completeness of fisheries data and information, in particular of catch data, and allow exchange and sharing of information; remove obstacles that hinder the development of a culture of compliance and the equitable treatment of operators within and across Member States. The proposal contains, inter alia, the following measures: clarification of the inspection process , inspectors' duties, and masters' and operators' duties during inspections. Digitisation of inspection reports through the mandatory use of an Electronic Inspection Report System which will allow a better use and exchange of data between relevant authorities and Member States; a new list of infringements of the CFP rules, which should be qualified as serious by nature, new detailed and exhaustive list of criteria to qualify as serious certain other infringements of the CFP rules; a more reliable and complete fisheries data system providing for the full digitisation of transhipment and landing declarations, applicable to all EU fishing vessels (including those less than 12 metres in length), an electronic traceability system for all vessels, new weighing procedures for fishery products and strengthened rules for recording recreational catches; better traceability of EU and imported fishery and aquaculture products : traceability information is clarified so that it allows linking a specific lot of fishery products to a particular landing by an EU fishing vessel. Information is recorded electronically so that controls in the supply chain within the internal market are more effective and efficient; the use of remote electronic monitoring tools , in particular CCTVs, for the control of the landing obligation. Certain vessels with active fishing gears shall be fitted with a device that monitors and records engine power; improving the reporting of lost fishing gear through the use of (electronic) logbooks for all categories of vessels, the deletion of the current derogation for vessels under 12 metres to take on board the equipment necessary to recover lost gear and laying down conditions to establish EU provisions for the marking and control of fishing gear for recreational fisheries; the revision of the mandate of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to fully align its objectives with the Common Fisheries Policy and extend its inspection powers."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2016/680 (Data Protection Directive in the field of law enforcement) required the Commission to review, by 6 May 2019 at the latest, other legal acts adopted by the Union which regulate the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes, in order to assess the need to bring them into line with the Directive and to make, if appropriate, the necessary proposals to amend those acts to ensure a consistent approach to the protection of personal data under the Directive. The Commission set out the results of its review in a Communication of 24 June 2020 which identifies ten legal acts that should be aligned with the Directive and sets out a timetable for doing so. The list includes Directive 2014/41/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Investigation Order in criminal matters. The Commission has indicated that it will present targeted amendments to this Directive in the last quarter of 2020; this is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: the Commission proposes the deletion of Article 20 of Directive 2014/41/EU on the European Investigation Order in criminal matters. Article 20 requires that any processing of personal data under the Directive comply with Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA and the principles of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (28 January 1981) and its Additional Protocol. Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the data protection law enforcement Directive entered into force on 6 May 2016. It provides a more comprehensive and general data protection instrument. It applies to domestic and cross-border processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, including safeguarding against and preventing threats to public security. In the interests of consistency and effective protection of personal data, it is proposed that the processing of personal data under Directive 2014/41/EU should comply, where appropriate, with the rules set out in Directive (EU) 2016/680. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) should apply to the processing of personal data in the context of certain types of non-criminal proceedings referred to in Directive 2014/41/EU where they are not covered by Directive (EU) 2016/680."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he TEN-E framework was developed and shaped in the 1990s through the successive TEN-E Guidelines and the corresponding financing Regulation. The report on the implementation of the TEN-E framework in the period 2007-2009 concluded that, while making a positive contribution to selected projects by giving them political visibility, the policy lacks focus, flexibility and a top-down approach to fill identified infrastructure gaps. In order to achieve the key objectives of its energy policy in terms of competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply, the Union as a matter of priority needs to modernise and expand its energy infrastructures and to interconnect networks across borders. Several challenges need to be addressed: electricity networks must be upgraded and modernised to meet increasing electricity demand due to a major shift in the overall energy value chain and mix; grids must also be urgently extended and upgraded, including through electricity highways, to foster market integration and maintain the existing levels of system's security, but especially to transport and balance electricity generated from renewable sources, which is expected to more than double in the period 2007-2020; the need for more innovation and intelligence in the networks at both transmission and distribution level, in particular through information and communication technologies; in the medium term, depleting indigenous conventional natural gas resources call for additional, diversified imports; given the role of oil in the energy mix of the coming decades, maintaining uninterrupted crude-oil supplies to land-locked EU countries in Central-Eastern Europe, currently dependent on limited supply routes, is of strategic importance; carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies would reduce carbon dioxide emissions on a large scale while allowing the use of fossil fuels, which will remain an important source for electricity generation over the next decades. The Commission, in its communication entitled “Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond” called for a new EU energy infrastructure policy to coordinate and optimise network development on a continental scale. It confirmed in particular the necessity to overhaul the existing trans-European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) policy and financing framework. In the report that it presented to the June 2011 Energy Council, the Commission estimated total investment needs in energy infrastructures of European importance up to 2020 at about EUR 200 billion. Investment volumes for the period from 2011 up to 2020 will increase by 30% for gas and up to 100% for electricity compared to current levels. The main identified obstacles, which will under business-as-usual assumptions prevent these investments from taking place or delay them far beyond the 2020 deadline, are problems related to permit granting (lengthy and ineffective permit granting procedures, along with public opposition), regulation (framework not geared towards delivering European infrastructure priorities) and financing (limited financing capacities of operators, lack of adapted funding instruments and sufficient support). BACKGROUND: after a first impact assessment, undertaken in 2010, the 2011 assessment, on the basis of the first, deals in greater detail with the policy options in the following areas: Permit granting and public consultation: The analysis compares three options: i) establishment of a regime of common interest; ii) definition of rules on the organisation and duration of the permit granting process, notably a ""full one-stop shop"" and a time limit; and iii) a combination of the two previous options. The overall impact of the last policy option is considered to be the most positive of all. Regulatory issues : the analysis compares three options: i) cross-border cost allocation; ii) investment incentives; and iii) a combination of the two previous options. The analysis shows that both an ex ante cross-border cost allocation mechanism and incentives commensurate with the risks incurred by the operator are necessary to ensure implementation of projects of common interest facing challenges with regard to their viability. Financing: four financing options were also examined: i) use of risk sharing instruments (including project bonds and guarantees); ii) use of risk capital instruments (including equity participations); iii) use of grant support for project studies and construction; and iv) a combination of grants, risk sharing and risk capital instruments. The overall impact of the last policy option was considered the most positive LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims at replacing the existing TEN-E Guidelines and will lead to the repeal of Decision 1364/2006/EC as of 1 January 2014. It seeks to lay down rules for the timely development and interoperability of trans-European energy networks in order to achieve the energy policy objectives of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to i) ensure the functioning of the internal energy market, ii) to ensure security of supply in the Union, iii) to promote energy efficiency and the development of new and renewable forms of energy, and iv) to promote the interconnection of energy networks. To this effect, this initiative identifies, for the period up to 2020 and beyond, a limited number of trans-European priority corridors and areas covering electricity and gas networks, as well as oil and carbon dioxide transport infrastructure, for which European Union action is most warranted. It then aims at implementing these priorities by: streamlining permit granting procedures to significantly reduce their duration for projects of common interest and increase public participation and acceptance for the implementation of such projects; facilitating the regulatory treatment of projects of common interest in electricity and gas by allocating costs depending on the benefits provided and ensuring allowed returns are in line with risks incurred; ensuring implementation of projects of common interest (PCIs) by providing necessary market-based and direct EU financial support. The main aspects of the proposal are as follows: Priority to 12 strategic trans-European energy infrastructure corridors and areas: the proposal establishes a selection process based on regional expert groups and an advisory role for the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) in electricity and gas, the final decision, to be updated every two years; the regional expert groups and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) are entrusted with the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of PCIs. The Commission may nominate European coordinators for PCIs facing difficulties. A regime of common interest for PCIs ,: this would give particular responsibilities to one national competent authority within each Member State to coordinate and oversee the permit granting process for PCIs, set minimum standards for transparency and public participation and fix the maximum allowed duration of the permit granting process; this clarifies that PCIs can be implemented under certain conditions for reasons of ""overriding public interest"", as defined in Directives 92/43/EC and 2000/60/EC; Member States are free to design their specific internal procedures in line with their national legal systems. Methodology and a process for the elaboration of a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis : on the basis of this methodology, it gives responsibility to national regulatory authorities and ACER to allocate costs across-border for PCIs in these sectors according to the benefits in the Member States directly or indirectly concerned by these PCIs; national regulatory authorities are also requested to grant appropriate incentives through tariffs for the implementation of PCIs facing higher risks for justified reasons. Eligibility of projects : the Regulation determines the conditions for eligibility of PCIs to Union financial assistance under the Connecting Europe Facility, for both studies (accessible to all PCIs except those in the oil sector) and works (accessible to all PCIs in the smart grids and carbon dioxide sector, and to PCIs in electricity and gas fulfilling certain conditions, notably having obtained a cross-border cost allocation decision). BUDGETARY IMPACT: all budgetary implications of this proposal are dealt with under the legislative financial statement of the Proposal for a Regulation establishing the Connecting Europe Facility. This mechanism, announced by the Commission in its Communication of 29 June 2011 ""A Budget for Europe 2020"" on the next multi-annual financial framework (2014-2020), is designed to finance the completion of priority energy, transport and digital infrastructures with a single fund of EUR 40 billion, of which EUR 9.1 billion would be dedicated to energy."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a new regulatory framework to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medical devices. At the same time, it sets high standards of quality and safety for medical devices in order to meet common safety concerns as regards such devices. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 significantly reinforces key elements of the existing regulatory approach in Council Directive 90/385/EEC and Council Directive 93/42/EEC, such as the supervision of notified bodies, conformity assessment procedures, clinical investigations and clinical evaluation, vigilance and market surveillance, whilst introducing provisions ensuring transparency and traceability regarding medical devices, to improve health and safety. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting public health crisis represent an unprecedented challenge for Member States and a heavy burden for national authorities, health care institutions and economic operators. The coronavirus crisis has created exceptional circumstances that require considerable additional resources and increased availability of vitally important medical devices such as medical gloves, surgical masks or intensive care equipment. None of these measures could reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation. These extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore very likely that Member States, health care institutions, economic operators and other stakeholders would not have been able to ensure its proper implementation and application from the date of application initially foreseen on 26 May 2020. CONTENT: for exceptional reasons, in the current context of the coronavirus epidemic, the Commission proposes to defer by one year, to 26 May 2021, the date of application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 which should have applied from 26 May 2020. The proposed amendment aims to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, namely the establishment of a rigorous, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for medical devices that ensures a high level of protection of public health and patient safety and the proper functioning of the internal market for these devices. At the same time, it is proposed to defer the date of repeal of Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices and Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices by one year. These postponements would ensure that an operational regulatory framework for medical devices would be in place from 26 May 2020. In addition, the proposed amendment aims to ensure that, in exceptional cases, the Commission may adopt, as soon as possible, EU-wide derogations following national derogations, in order to effectively address potential shortages of vitally important medical devices in the EU. In view of the urgent need to respond immediately to the public health crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed amending Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: first paragraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: currently as an exception to State aid rules, the German authorities may grant State aid under the German Alcohol Monopoly for products marketed, after further transformation, by the monopoly, as ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. The total allowed State aid is limited to EUR 110 million per year. According to Article 182(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation), the derogation ends on 31 December 2010. This proposal extends the application of the derogation and proposes that the production/sales by the monopoly shall gradually decrease so that the monopoly will finally cease to exist as from 1 January 2018. Two categories of distilleries are dealt with differently: the agricultural bonded distilleries (landwirtschaftliche Verschlussbrennereien – there are currently about 670 distilleries of this type) processing mainly cereals and potatoes, may remain in the monopoly until the end of 2013. Their production will however be gradually reduced from 540.000 hl in 2011, to 360.000 hl in 2012 and 180.000 hl in 2013. When leaving the Monopoly the agricultural bonded distilleries may receive a compensatory aid of EUR 257,50 per hl of nominal distilling rights. This compensatory aid is granted at the latest on 31 December 2013, but may be paid in several instalments until 31 December 2017; -the small-scale flat-rate distilleries (Abfindungsbrennereien), distillery users (Stoffbesitzer) and fruit cooperative distilleries (Obstgemeinschaftsbrennereien) which are locally-oriented and produce very small quantities of alcohol from fruits (up to 300 litres per year) may produce in total up to 60.000 hl annually until the end of 2017. The total amount of aid paid from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 shall not exceed EUR 269.9 million and the total amount of aid paid from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2017 shall not exceed EUR 268 million. Germany will continue to present an annual report to the Commission on the functioning of the system. Moreover, from 2013 to 2016 Germany will on a yearly basis include an annual phasing-out plan for the small-scale flat-rate distilleries, distillery users and fruit cooperative distilleries. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: the proposal has no financial implications for the European Union budget."

The proposed Council Decision aims to approve the Status Agreement between the European Union and Montenegro on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Montenegro as foreseen in the Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 on the European Border and Coast Guard. Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 explicitly provides that, in cases where it is envisaged that European Border and Coast Guard teams will be deployed to a third country, in actions where the team members will have executive powers, or where other actions in third countries require it, a status agreement shall be concluded by the Union with the third country concerned. The purpose of the Status Agreement is to provide a legally binding framework that should set out the scope of the operation, the rules on civil and criminal liability, and the tasks and powers of the deployed members of the teams. The status agreements should also guarantee the full respect of fundamental rights and should establish dedicated complaints mechanisms to be used in case of fundamental rights violations during these operations. The Status Agreement with Montenegro is one of several similar agreements concluded with the Western Balkan countries. It would allow for joint operations, rapid border interventions and/or return operations to take place on the territory of Montenegro with the involvement of the Agency. The return operations would relate solely to third country nationals being returned from the European Union to Montenegro."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the sustained financial and economic crisis is increasing the pressure on national financial resources, as Member States are reducing their budgets. In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of ESIF programmes is of particular importance as a tool for injecting funds into the economy. Article 24 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that on the request of a Member State with temporary budgetary difficulties, i.e. those countries which have received financial assistance under an adjustment programme after 21 December 2013, interim payments may be increased by 10 percentage points above the co-financing rate applicable to each priority for the ERDF, ESF, and the Cohesion Fund or to each measure for the EAFRD and the EMFF, provided the Member State submits a corresponding request. This provision currently applies until 30 June 2016. Article 120(3) of the same Regulation provides that from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2017, the maximum co-financing rate at the level of each priority for all operational programmes supported by the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus shall be 85 % instead of 50 % applicable to more developed regions. The Regulation requires the Commission to review these two financial provisions and make, if necessary, a legislative proposal before 30 June 2016 with a view to their possible extension. The Five countries were eligible for the 10% top-up on interim payments submitted before 30 June 2016. Since then the financial assistance programmes for Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Romania have expired. This means that Greece is the only country under an adjustment programme on 30 June 2016. Cyprus exited its adjustment programme at the end of March 2016. However, the economic situation of Cyprus is still fragile as reflected by its sluggish growth rate, declining investment, high unemployment and stressed financial sector. CONTENT: in order to ensure that Member States with temporary budgetary difficulties continue implementing the ESIF programmes and disburse funds to projects, the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 would allow the Commission to: top up payments to a Member State under an adjustment programme after 30 June 2016 (currently Greece). It would cover the period until 30 June of the year following the calendar year in which the Member State stops receiving financial assistance. This approach is in line with the ESI Funds accounting year which covers the period from 1 July to 30 June. It would extend the period of eligibility up to maximum 18 months; extend the exceptional cofinancing rate of 85 % for the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus until programme closure with a view to easing the pressure on the national budget and accelerating much-needed investments. The total financial allocation for the period from the Funds to the countries and the programmes in question will not change. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of ESIF financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2014-2020. For payment appropriations, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. Based on the payment forecast from Member States revised by the Commission and the payment appropriations included in the 2016 budget and in the 2017 Draft Budget, the need for payment appropriations are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 544 million. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal may imply a temporary increase of payment appropriations, which would be compensated by lower payments at the end of the life cycle of the 2014-2020 programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. More specifically: (i) agricultural prices have fallen sharply as a result of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions; (ii) the EU has become more open to global markets; (iii) the EU has made new commitments at international level, for example on climate change mitigation (through COP 21). On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a regulation defining the objectives of the CAP as well as rules on support for strategic plans to be developed by Member States in the framework of the CAP; a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. The CAP general objectives shall focus on the economic viability, the resilience and income of farms, on an enhanced environmental and climate performance, and on the strengthened socio-economic fabric of rural areas. Moreover, fostering knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas is a cross-cutting objective. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation seeks to maintain the architecture and main features of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 on the common organisation of the market in agricultural products while amending a limited number of provisions in view of the new challenges relating to environmental sustainability and climate change and to citizens' expectations regarding food. The proposal seeks, inter alia: to delete provisions related to sectorial interventions as these interventions of the future CAP will be regulated under the CAP strategic plan Regulation and be part of Member States' strategic plans, to ensure a better coherence of CAP interventions; to amend current rules on geographical indications (GIs) aiming at a simpler GI system, faster registration of geographical indications and more efficient approval of amendments to product specifications. The objective is to make the GI system more understandable for consumers, easier to promote, and to reduce the administrative costs associated with managing the system; to simplify some specific procedures with regard to the rules on GIs for wine to make the approval process more efficient; · to clarify the definition of 'Protected Designation of Origin' for wines to enable producer groups to use new varietals, also needed in response to climate change; · to strengthen the protection of GIs against counterfeiting of GIs on the interned and on goods in transit; · to apply the proposed simplification for wine GIs has to be applied also to agricultural products and foodstuffs; · to include provisions that merely translate into internal legislation commitments taken by the EU and its Member States in the context of recent World Trade Organization Ministerial Decisions, notably on export subsidies; · to delete a number of obsolete provisions, inter alia the system of production regulation and requirements applying to the sugar sector that expired at the end of the 2016/2017 marketing year. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fiscalis 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing cooperation between tax authorities within the Union. The added value of those programmes, including as regards the protection of the financial and economic interests of Member States of the Union and of taxpayers, has been recognised by the tax authorities of the participating countries. The Union and the national tax authorities still suffer from insufficient capacity and insufficient cooperation – both within the EU and with third countries – to carry out effectively and efficiently their missions. They need to provide quick and joint responses to emerging problems such as tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, digitalisation and new business models, while at the same time preventing unnecessary administrative burden for citizens and businesses in cross-border transactions. Therefore, the Commission is proposing a new fiscalis programme under the Single Market, Innovation and Digital budget heading. It shall comprise means and a budget which shall support tax policy and tax authorities through administrative and IT capacity building activities and operational cooperation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the fiscalis programme for cooperation in the field of taxation for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the Fiscalis 2020 programme. Objective : the programme has the general objective to support tax authorities and taxation to enhance the functioning of the single market, foster Union competitiveness and protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States. It supports tax policy, tax cooperation and administrative capacity building, including human competency and the development and operation of the European electronic systems. The programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. The implementation of the programme will occur through the most commonly used spending mechanisms of Union budget, namely public procurement and grants. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation provides mechanisms, means as well as the necessary funding aiming to support tax policy and to improve cooperation between tax authorities. The proposed measure comprises inter alia meetings and similar ad-hoc events, project-based structured collaboration and human competency and capacity building actions, in which Member States and their officials may participate on a voluntary basis. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of common components and national components reflecting better the reality of IT projects and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand, and the Member States on the other hand, have been listed A multi-annual strategic plan for taxation to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. The Commission and the Member States shall ensure jointly the development and operation, including the design, specification, conformance testing, deployment, maintenance, evolution, security, quality assurance and quality control, of the European electronic systems listed in the multi-annual strategic plan for taxation. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 270 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: plastic makes up 80-85% of the total number of marine litter items, measured through beach counts. The 10 most found single-use plastic items represent 86% of all single use plastic items (constituting thus 43% of all marine litter items found on European beaches by count). Fishing gear containing plastics accounts for another 27% of marine litter items found on European beaches. Single-use plastic products and fishing gear containing plastic are therefore a particularly serious problem in the context of marine litter and pose a severe risk to marine ecosystems, biodiversity and, potentially, to human health. Existing Union legislation and policy instruments provide some regulatory responses to address marine litter. However, the impact of that legislation on marine litter is not sufficient and there are differences in the scope and the level of ambition amongst national measures to prevent and reduce marine litter. Therefore, as part of its plastics strategy, the European Commission committed to look into further action to address plastic marine litter that builds on the piecemeal efforts underway in EU Member States, and that follows the approach used of light-weight plastic carrier bags. This initiative focuses therefore on the 10 most found single use plastic items and fishing gear, which together represent around 70% of these marine litter items by count. The initiative should be seen in the broader context of the transition to a circular economy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four scenarios were modelled based on a selection of different measures applied to different items: (i) items for which sustainable alternatives are available. The objective is to promote less harmful alternatives; (ii) items for which there is no alternative. The aim is to limit damages by better informing consumers and making producers financially responsible of environmental consequences; (iii) items which are already well captured. The scenario chosen is that of a ‘medium-high impact on reducing marine litter’ which would address the underlying drivers more adequately and goes further to change consumer behaviour. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to prevent and reduce the impact of certain single-use plastic products and fishing gear containing plastic on the environment and human health as well as to promote the transition to a circular economy with environment-friendly innovative business models, products and materials, thus contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market. This proposal provides specific objectives and measures for the prevention and management of waste in relation to single-use plastic products that are most found on the beaches in the Union and fishing gear containing plastic. Specifically, the proposal: requires Member States to take the necessary measures to achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of food containers, cups for beverages that are single-use plastic products; lays down restrictions on the placing on the market of certain single-use plastic products for which alternatives exist on the market: plastic cotton buds, cutlery, plates, straws, drink stirrers and sticks for balloons; lays down product design requirements for beverage containers that are single-use plastic products, to ensure that their caps and lids with a significant part made of plastic remain attached to the container during its use stage so that such waste does not leak into the environment; lays down marking requirements for certain single-use plastic products to avoid that they are improperly disposed of, for example through flushing in toilets. This shall apply to sanitary towels, wet wipes and balloons; establishes extended producer responsibility schemes for fishing gear containing plastics and certain single-use plastic products such as food containers, bags and packaging, beverage containers and cups, tobacco products with filters, wet wipes, balloons and lightweight plastic bags. The proposal also lays down specific and additional requirements for the financial responsibility of producers, in particular, for awareness raising campaigns and in the case of single-use plastics also the clean-up of litter; obliges Member States to collect 90% of single-use plastic drinks bottles by 2025, for example through deposit refund schemes; requires Member States to take measures to raise awareness about the impact of littering and inappropriate disposal of waste on the environment, in particular, the aquatic environment and about the available re-use and waste management options. Lastly, the proposal requires Member States to put in place a data set on products subject to a consumption reduction objective in order to monitor the implementation of that consumption reduction objective under this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the website-developer market consisted of some 175 000 enterprises in the 27 EU Member States. It employed some 1 million people and the generated turnover was EUR 144 billion. The European market for web-accessibility related products and services is estimated at EUR 2 billion. It could grow significantly, as less than 10% of websites are accessible. The number of websites providing e-government services (about 380 500 in the EU) and public sector websites (over 761 000 in the EU) is growing rapidly. Most Member States have already either enacted legislation, or taken other measures on web accessibility. However, significant differences exist between these laws and measures. The non-harmonised national approaches to web-accessibility create barriers in the Internal Market. Harmonisation of national measures for the public sector at EU level is being proposed as a necessary condition to put an end to this fragmentation and lack of confidence in the web accessibility market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. An Impact Assessment Steering Group, led by the Directorate General for the Information Society and Media, was established with a wide representation of services and departments of the Commission. The Commission believes that harmonisation will lead to better market conditions, more jobs, cheaper web-accessibility and more accessible websites: a triple win for governments, businesses, and citizens. In addition, the Directive would support Member States in achieving their national commitments regarding web accessibility, as well as their commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities regarding websites of public sector bodies. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Directive aims at approximating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on the accessibility of public sector bodies' websites, by defining harmonised requirements. Purpose and scope: the proposal lays down the technical provisions whereby Member States shall make accessible the content of certain types of websites of public sector bodies which provide information and services that are essential for citizens' participation in economy and society (e.g. income tax, employment services, social security, personal documents, vehicle registration, police statements, university or higher education enrolment). Requirements for web-accessibility: the requirements for web-accessibility are defined along two dimensions: (i) user orientation; and (ii) market orientation and interoperability. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to specify further, where appropriate, the harmonised requirements necessary to ensure the accessibility of the websites concerned. In order to ensure that current political commitments are promptly achieved, the above provisions are to be implemented by 31 December 2015. Harmonised standards and presumption of conformity: this Directive is in line with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on European Standardisation which sets the legal basis for the Commission to request European standardisation organisations to develop harmonised standards to assist stakeholders in providing presumption of conformity. In one of the Directive’s recitals, it is indicated that the Success Criteria and Requirements for Level AA conformance specified in the version 2.0 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) issued by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), are expected to be taken into account in the European standard resulting from Mandate 376 and subsequently in the harmonised standard that should be built upon the outcome of this work.. These technology neutral specifications provide the basis for the requirements for web-accessibility. European and international standards and presumption of conformity: in the absence of harmonised standards, the Directive provides a solution for presumption of conformity with the web-accessibility requirements to the websites concerned which meet European standards or parts thereof that have been determined by the Commission by delegated acts. Mandate 376 is preparing a European Standard that includes web accessibility. In the absence of such European standard, the Directive also provides a solution for presumption of conformity with the web-accessibility requirements to the websites concerned which meet the parts of the ISO/IEC 40500:2012 covering the Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements for Level AA conformance. Reports: the accessibility of a website should be continuously monitored, in the light of regular updates of web content. Member States are requested to monitor the public sector bodies' websites concerned, using the methodology established by Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no implications for the budget of the Union. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains the provisions for the exercise of delegated acts in line with Article 290 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2008 global financial crisis revealed important regulatory gaps in the financial system. It also highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where non-bank credit activities took place, called “shadow banking”. Confronted with new legislative developments in the banking sector, including structural measures, it is possible that banks will shift parts of their activity into less regulated areas as shadow banking. At the end of 2012 global shadow banking assets accounted for EUR 53 trillion, representing about half the size of the regulated banking system and mainly concentrated in Europe (around EUR 23 trillion) and in the United States (around EUR 19.3 trillion). On 19 March 2012, the Commission published a Green Paper on shadow banking, and on 4 September 2013, it published a Communication on the subject. It stressed that the complex and opaque nature of securities financing transactions (SFTs) makes it difficult to identify counterparties and monitor risk concentration. This also leads to the built-up of excessive leverage in the financial system. A High-Level Expert Group chaired by Erkki Liikanen adopted a report on reforming the structure of the Union banking sector in October 2012. The report recognised the risks of shadow banking activities such as high leverage and pro- cyclicality, and it called for a reduction of the interconnectedness between banks and the shadow banking system, which had been a source of contagion in a system-wide banking crisis. Actions regarding these matters have been international and coordinated through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) which, in August 2013, adopted a policy framework consisting of eleven Recommendations addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos. These Recommendations were subsequently endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders. In order to closely follow market trends regarding entities whose activities qualify as shadow banking, in particular in the area of securities financing transactions, the Commission feels it necessary to implement transparency requirements. The proposal regarding structural reforms of the EU banking sector, which is presented in a package with this proposal, is the final piece of the new regulatory framework, ensuring that even the largest banks in the EU become less complex and can be effectively resolved, with minimum implications for tax payers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that a combination of different measures is necessary including reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, disclosure on the use of SFTs to fund investors, and the need for prior consent to rehypothecation of the financial instruments. The latter must be transferred to an account opened in the name of the receiving counterparty before rehypothecation can take place. This will ensure that the shadow banking activity of using SFTs is properly supervised and regulated. The use of SFTs as such will not be prohibited nor limited by specific restrictions but be more transparent. CONTENT: the Regulation aims at enhancing financial stability in the EU by means of increasing transparency of certain market activities, such as SFTs, rehypothecation and other financing structures having equivalent economic effect as SFTs. The Regulation introduces measures to improve the transparency in three main areas: (1) the monitoring of the build-up of systemic risks related to SFT transactions in the financial system; (2) the disclosure of the information on such transactions to the investors whose assets are employed in these or equivalent transactions; and (3) the contractual transparency of rehypothecation activities. In practice, the proposed measures will cover the FSB recommendations, these being: The obligation for competent authorities to collect additional data on the use of SFTs: the draft Regulation creates a Union framework under which financial or non-financial counterparties of a SFT will efficiently report the details of the transaction to trade repositories. This information will be centrally stored and easily and directly accessible to the relevant authorities, such as ESMA, ESRB, the ESCB, for the purpose of identification and monitoring of financial stability risks entailed by shadow banking activities of regulated and non-regulated entities. The requirement that requires fund managers be transparent towards their investors: in order to enable investors to become aware of the risks associated with the use of SFTs and other financing structures, fund managers should include detailed information on any recourse they have to these techniques in regular reporting intervals. The existing periodical reports that UCITS management or investment companies and AIF managers have to produce will be supplemented by this additional information on the use of SFTs and other financing structures. The requirement for financial intermediaries to provide sufficient disclosure to their clients in relation to re-hypothecation of assets : any rehypothecation should therefore take place only with the express knowledge of inherent risks and prior consent of the providing counterparty in a contractual agreement and should be appropriately reflected in the securities accounts. The counterparty receiving financial instruments as collateral will be allowed to rehypothecate them only with the express consent of the providing counterparty and only after having them transferred to its own account. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal involves the hiring of two new temporary agents at EBA from January 2016. The new tasks will be carried out with the human resources available within the annual budgetary allocation procedure, and in line with the financial programming for agencies. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. To ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link, it would be beneficial to retain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single safety authority responsible for the whole of this infrastructure. To this end, it is necessary to adapt Directive (EU) 2016/798. In a parallel and related initiative, the Commission also proposes the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and Council empowering France to negotiate and conclude under certain conditions an international agreement that would maintain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single national safety authority for the Channel Fixed Link. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Article 3(7) of Directive (EU) 2016/798, which defines the concept of ‘national safety authority’ for the purposes of both railway safety under that Directive and railway interoperability under Directive (EU) 2016/797. Specifically, the proposal shall: - allow a body entrusted by a Member State and a third country with the tasks regarding railway safety and interoperability on the basis of an international agreement concluded or authorised by the EU to be considered as a national safety authority under Union law; - provide that, where necessary for reasons of railway safety, the Member State concerned should make use without delay of the right afforded by the agreement with the third country concerned, whereby the national safety authority is entitled to assume sole competence over the part of the rail infrastructure situated in that Member State; - provide that the European Court of Justice would have jurisdiction to give a ruling at the request of an arbitration tribunal set up by an international agreement such as the one that France should be empowered to negotiate and conclude with the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, maritime safety and security, search and rescue operations, fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The objective of this initiative is to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency should therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coastguard functions to increase maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. CONTENT: this legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes proposals for a Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency. The proposal stipulates that the EMSA shall, in cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Fisheries Control Agency, support national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at international level by: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the agencies, in accordance with their respective legal bases and without prejudice to the ownership of data by Member States; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building by elaborating guidelines , recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhancing the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative requires an increase in the EU contribution to EMSA of around EUR 22 million per year (that is around EUR 87 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 17 TA staff. This is operational expenditure for around EUR 81 million mainly to cover provision of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) services for border control surveillance (EUR 67 million) and satellite aerial surveillance (SAT-AIS) and Satcom data and services to increase the surveillance capability of the 3 agencies and national authorities to strengthen as a primary objective the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2006, a High Level Contact Group (""HLCG""), composed of senior officials from the Commission, the Council Presidency and the U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and State, was established to explore ways that would enable the EU and the U.S. to work more efficiently together in the exchange of law enforcement information while ensuring that the protection of personal data and privacy are guaranteed. The conclusion reached in the HLCG final report of October 20091 was that an international agreement binding both the EU and the U.S. to apply agreed common data protection principles for transatlantic data transfers in the law enforcement area was the best option. On 3 December 2010, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations on such an agreement between the European Union and the United States of America. On 28 March 2011, the Commission opened negotiations. On 8 September 2015, the Parties initialled the text. The Agreement should now be concluded on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the protection of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offenses. The Agreement aims to establish a comprehensive framework of data protection principles and safeguards when personal information is transferred for criminal law enforcement purposes between the U.S., on the one hand, and the EU or its Member States on the other. The objective is to ensure a high level of personal data protection when transferred between the U.S., on the one hand, and the EU or its Member States on the other, for law enforcement purposes and, thereby, enhance cooperation between the parties. Whilst not being itself the legal basis for any transfer of personal information to the U.S., the Agreement supplements, where necessary, data protection safeguards in existing and future data transfer agreements or national provisions authorising such transfers. 1) Scope and general objectives: the Agreement aims to establish for the first time, a data protection instrument that covers in a comprehensive and consistent manner all data transfers in a given area (i.e. transatlantic data exchanges in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters). Furthermore, the Agreement will substantiate in the transatlantic context the general requirements on international data transfers laid down in the future directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data adopted on 14 April 2016. 2) Data protection principles and safeguards: the Agreement covers important principles governing personal data processing as well as key safeguards and limitations: Purpose and use limitations: processing (which includes transfers) can take place only for explicit and legitimate purposes within the scope of the Umbrella Agreement, i.e. the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences. The Agreement ensures the application of the safeguards to the entire ""life cycle"" of a given data set from the original transfer from the EU to its processing by a U.S. competent authority and vice-versa, as well as its possible further processing by another U.S. authority or, in the case of a data transfer from the U.S. to a competent authority of the EU or (one of) its Member States, its possible further sharing with/processing by another EU or Member State authority. Onward transfer: if a U.S. authority intends to further transfer data it has received from the EU or one of its Member States to a third country/international organisation not bound by the agreement, it will first have to obtain consent from the law enforcement authority in the EU which has originally transferred the data to the United States. This rule equally applies where an authority of the EU or one of its Member States intends to further transfer data it has received from the U.S. to a third country/international organisation. The provisions expressly take into account the special sensitivity of the transfer in bulk of data of unsuspected persons (e.g. PNR data of every passenger taking a flight, independently of any specific suspicion). The Agreement requires that any further transfer of personal information other than in relation to specific cases, may only take place under specific conditions that provide due justification for the onward transfer. In addition, the Parties to the Agreement must take measures to ensure: Special categories of data: the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or religious or other beliefs, trade-union membership or personal information concerning health or sexual life, may only take place when appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with law (e.g. masking the information after effecting the purpose for which the data was processed or requiring supervisory approval to access the information). 3) Individual rights: data subjects will be able, for the first time, to avail themselves of rights of general application for any transatlantic transfer of personal data in the criminal law enforcement sector, these being: 4) Aspects relating to the application of the Agreement and oversight: measures must be put in pace in order to: The Agreement will be of unlimited duration (which is justified by the nature of the Agreement as a framework providing for protections and safeguards, as well as in the light of the possibility of suspending and terminating the Agreement)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current health security framework, established by Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health, provides a limited legal framework for EU level coordination, based essentially on a) an early warning system (EWRS) and the exchange of information and cooperation within the HSC. Early lessons learnt have shown that the current system has not allowed an optimal response at EU level to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structures and mechanisms under the Decision, while key in facilitating the exchange of information on the evolution of the pandemic and in supporting the adoption of national measures, could do little to trigger a timely common EU level response, co-ordinate the crucial aspects of risk communication, or ensure solidarity among Member States. The revision of the health security framework proposes a stronger and more comprehensive legal basis for the EU to prepare and respond to health crises. In addition, the proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to enhance the roles of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). CONTENT: the overarching aim of the proposed regulation is to provide a strengthened framework for health crisis preparedness and response at EU level by addressing the weaknesses exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it would: set out a comprehensive legislative framework to govern action at EU level on preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, and early warning and responses; and enhance the EU’s guidance in the adoption of common measures at EU level to face a future cross-border health threat. The proposal aims to provide EU added value through the development of an EU health crisis and pandemic preparedness plan, complemented by: national plans and transparent reporting of capacities; strengthened, integrated surveillance systems at EU level supported by improved data collection tools and artificial intelligence, environmental surveillance, to detect early signals of a possible threat; enhanced risk assessment for health threats; increased power to enforce a coordinated response at EU level through the Health Security Committee; and an improved mechanism for recognition of and response to public health emergencies. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications are related mainly to the following objectives: preparedness plans established at EU and national level accompanied by reporting and auditing; training programmes for specialists; digitalised, integrated surveillance system at EU level, better detection of early signals for accurate risk assessment and response; establishment of new EU networks of laboratories; reinforcement of risk assessments for chemical, environmental and climate threats; and established structure and processes for the recognition of emergency at EU level."

CONTENT: the objective of the above-mentioned Agreement is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the Member States of the EU and Iceland and Norway by applying certain provisions of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between Member States of the European Union and the 2001 Protocol to Iceland and Norway. The Agreement was signed in 2003, but has not been concluded and has not entered into force. The purpose of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters is to encourage and modernise cooperation between judicial, police and customs authorities by supplementing the provisions and facilitating the application of the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and its 1978 Protocol, the 1990 Convention applying the Schengen Agreement and the Benelux Treaty of 1962. The convention is supplemented by a Protocol established by the Council which provides for supplementary measures such as requests for information on banking transactions in order to combat crime in general and organised crime in particular. Procedure : following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, the procedures to be followed for the conclusion of the Agreement are governed by Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Agreement was signed already 6 years ago and therefore it should now be concluded as soon as possible. It is for this reason that the Commission proposes to conclude the Agreement. It recommends that the Council, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, adopt a decision concluding the Agreement. It should be noted that in accordance with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it is provided that in the case of agreements covering fields to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, the Council shall adopt a decision concluding the agreement, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: The European Network and Information Security Agency (hereinafter ENISA) was set up in March 2004 for an initial period of five years by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004. Regulation (EC) No 1007/2008 extended ENISA’s mandate until March 2012. The extension of ENISA’s mandate in 2008 also launched a debate on the general direction of European efforts towards network and information security (NIS), to which the Commission contributed by launching a public consultation (which ran from November 2008 to January 2009 and gathered nearly 600 contributions). On 30 March 2009, the Commission adopted a Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection(CIIP) focusing on the protection of Europe from cyber attacks and cyber disruptions by enhancing preparedness, security and resilience, with an Action Plan calling on ENISA to play a role, mainly in support to Member States. The Action Plan was broadly endorsed in the discussion at the Ministerial Conference on CIIP held in Tallinn, Estonia, on 27 and 28 April 2009. The European Union Presidency’s Conference Conclusions stress the importance of the need to rethink and reformulate the Agency’s mandate. After discussion at the Telecom Council of 11 June 2009, Member States expressed support for extending the ENISA’s mandate and increasing its resources in the light of the importance of NIS and the evolving challenges in the area It is therefore now proposed to extend ENISA’s mandate until 2013 to allow sufficient time for the adoption of a new Regulation that would thoroughly revise the provisions governing the Agency (a proposal for a recast of the Regulation establishing the Agency is proposed in parallel). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency with a view to extending its mandate until 13 September 2013, the time that will allow Parliament and Council to adopt a new Regulation revising the provisions governing the Agency and establishing the Agency for a 5-year duration. This proposal provides for the extension of the Agency’s current mandate by 18 months. FINANCIAL IMPLICATION: in its financial impact statement, the European Commission estimates the necessary funding for the extension of ENISA’s current mandate at EUR 12.698 million in commitments and payments for the period running from 14 March 2012 to 13 September 2013. These sums would come from heading 1a of the financial perspectives (EUR 6.673 million in 2012 and EUR 6.025 million in 2013)."

PHILOSOPHY AND ACTION PLAN FOR EXTERNAL AID 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the EU can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of EU citizens. It is therefore in the interest of the EU to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. The Lisbon Treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The EU's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. Its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the EU. In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) The present European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was developed in 2004 and covers 16 partners to the East and South of the EU’s borders. Under the ENP the EU offers its neighbours a privileged relationship, building upon a mutual commitment to values and principles such as democracy and human rights, the rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and sustainable development, including climate action. The policy also provides for political association and deeper economic integration, increased mobility and enhanced people-to-people contacts. Arab Spring : changes to the EU’s relationship with its neighbours and developments since the ENP was set up have been analysed and assessed as part of the ENP Strategic Review. As a result, a new ENP vision has been developed as outlined in the Joint Communication of the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission ’A new response to a changing Neighbourhood’. The new approach calls notably for greater support to partners committed to building democratic societies and undertaking reforms, in line with the “more for more” and ""mutual accountability"" principles, and provides the strategic policy framework for the EU relations with the neighbours. Reform of the ENPI : although the ENPI has been widely recognized as a successful Instrument to accompany the EU’s policy towards its neighbours, the ENP policy review and other assessments, lessons learned and public consultations have all identified a number of issues to tackle in the future by adapting the Instrument to make the EU’s response even more effective, in particular: application of the “more for more” principle; complexity and length of the programming process; scope of the Instrument; partly outdated implementation provisions and lack of coherence between the external instruments; Cross-Border Cooperation (CBC) provisions; linkages with internal instruments/policies; evolving relationship with Russia. The future European Neighbourhood Instrument should be aligned to the new ENP vision and address the specific challenges and issues as identified above. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment reviewed the following four options: Option 0 : ‘No EU action’. The EU stops providing financial support through a dedicated Instrument for Neighbourhood countries; Option 1 : ‘No change’. Cooperation with the countries concerned remains strictly in the framework of the existing ENPI Regulation; Option 2 : ‘Adapting the current set-up’. The future legislative proposal should be based on the current ENPI Regulation with a number of substantial amendments, responding to the new policy context and specific objectives. Under this Option there are a number of sub-options referring to: the differentiation principle; the programming process; scope of the Instrument and coherence between policy and assistance; Cross-Border Cooperation rules; implementation provision, notably to allow for greater flexibility; linkages with internal policies and instruments and geographic scope of the ENI. Option 3 : ‘Tabling a completely new Instrument’ with a different geographic scope and focussing on objectives broader than or different from those of the ENP. Based on the analysis, Option 2 would have the highest potential to yield a positive impact and to adapt the current cooperation framework to the new policy context, ENP objectives and challenges identified through evaluations and lessons learned. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) and Article 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Regulation, the Commission proposes to establish assistance to the partner countries listed below with the aim of establishing an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness at the EU’s borders. Partner countries : as well as Russia in accordance with specific provisions. Specific objectives of Union’s support : support under this Regulation shall promote enhanced political cooperation and progressive economic integration between the Union and the partner countries and, in particular, the implementation of partnership and cooperation agreements, association agreements or other existing and future agreements, and jointly agreed action plans. Union support should target in particular: promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, principles of equality, establishing deep and sustainable democracy, promoting good governance and developing a thriving civil society including social partners; achieving progressive integration into the Union internal market and enhanced sector and cross-sectoral co-operation including through legislative approximation and regulatory convergence towards Union and other relevant international standards, related institution building and investments, notably in interconnections; creating conditions for well managed mobility of people and promotion of people-to-people contacts; sustainable and inclusive development in all aspects, poverty reduction, including through private-sector development; promotion of internal economic, social and territorial cohesion, rural development, climate action and disaster resilience; promoting confidence building and other measures contributing to security and the prevention and settlement of conflicts; enhancing sub-regional, regional and Neighbourhood wide collaboration as well as Cross-Border Cooperation. Union support may also be used in other areas when this is consistent with the overall objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The achievement of these objectives shall be measured using notably the relevant EU periodic reports on the implementation of the policy and the relevant indicators established by international organisations and other relevant bodies. Framework strategy : the key elements of the proposal (as compared to the current set-up) and their rationale are the following: pply the principle of “more for more” and mutual accountability in line with the new vision of the ENP, notably through specific provisions on differentiation for financial allocations and for the programming process, as required; address the complexity and length of the programming process in order to streamline, shorten and better focus the process, especially for ENP partners that have jointly agreed with the EU strategic priorities in Action Plans or equivalent documents; streamline the scope of the Instrument , striking a balance between flexibility of the Instrument and focus on the policy objectives and key areas of cooperation; adapt the implementation provisions and improve coherence between the external instruments; improve the provisions on the Cross-Border Cooperation to facilitate effective and fast implementation of the programmes; promote closer links with EU internal instruments and policies, including by stepping up cooperation with the Commission at the programming stage and, where relevant, promote mechanisms to pool funds from internal and external headings of the EU budget; respond to the evolving relationship with Russia by amending provisions on Russia’s eligibility for ENI funding to reflect the specific status of Russia as an EU neighbour and strategic partner. Strategic framework and indicative programming : the scope of the Instrument has been streamlined by bringing down the 29 thematic areas that feature in the current ENPI Regulation to six specific objectives. A new, simplified programming tool for most of the neighbouring countries (Single Support Framework) has been introduced. This new programming document will be shorter than the Strategy Papers and Multiannual Indicative Programmes, will prevent duplication of information contained in the legal/political documents that underpin EU relations with its neighbours, and should help shorten the programming process, therefore reducing administrative costs. The new article that allows funds from the ENI and the relevant internal Heading of the EU budget to be pooled with a single set of rules for measures addressing notably cross-border challenges will substantially improve efficiency and reduce the administrative costs of implementing such measures. Simplified implementation : t o implement the new ENI Regulation, simplified and flexible procedures should lead to swifter adoption of implementing measures and swifter delivery of EU assistance, in particular in situations of crises or threats to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, or natural or man-made disasters. Revision of the Financial Regulation, which has particularly substantial provisions on external action, will also help facilitate the participation of civil society organisations and small businesses in funding programmes. The Commission intends to implement this Regulation using the new flexible procedures provided for in the new Financial Regulation. Furthermore additional simplification will also be achieved through the development of one horizontal framework regulation comprising all general and recurring provisions, providing for increased coherence between the external actions instruments. Coherence and complementarity : in implementing this Regulation, coherence shall be ensured with other areas of the Union external action as well as other relevant Union policies. Other measures are provided to ensure donor coordination. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Commission in its Communication of 29 June 2011 entitled “A Budget for Europe 2020” proposed allocating to the ENI EUR 18 182 300 000 (current prices) for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: delegated powers to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union should be conferred to the Commission for adopting the specific implementing measures required for the Cross-Border Cooperation mechanisms established in Title III of this Regulation. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should further ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Taking into account the nature of those implementing acts, in particular their policy orientation nature or their financial implications, the examination procedure should in principle be used for their adoption, except for measures of a small financial scale."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it has become more and more apparent that consumer policy is one area which can make a telling contribution to meeting the Europe 2020 objectives. In Europe there are 500 million consumers and consumer expenditure amounts to 56% of EU GDP. The more consumers are able to make informed decisions, the greater the impact they can have on strengthening the Single Market and stimulating growth. However, empowerment is not only a question of consumer rights but of building an overall environment that enables consumers to make use of those rights and benefit from them. The Communication 'A budget for Europe 2020' of 29 June 2011 allocated funds to the Consumer Programme for the period 2014-2020, and this proposal aims at establishing a Consumer Programme for the period 2014-2020, as a successor to the 2007-2013 Programme of Community Action in the field of consumer policy. The new Consumer Programme will support the general objective of future consumer policy placing the empowered consumer at the centre of the Single Market. The actions under the new Programme are grouped in the following four categories: ·  to consolidate and enhance product Safety through effective market surveillance throughout the EU; ·  to improve consumers' education, information and awareness of their rights, to develop the evidence base for consumer policy and to provide support to consumer organisations; ·  to consolidate consumer rights in particular through regulatory action and improving access to redress including alternative dispute resolution; ·  to support enforcement of consumer rights by strengthening cooperation between national enforcement bodies and by supporting consumers with advice. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment considered four options: ·  Option 0 corresponds to the absolute minimum actions to be financed resulting from the legal obligations imposed by the Treaty and the existing EU acquis in the field of consumer protection. ·  Option 1 corresponds to the baseline scenario. Under this option, the majority of actions conducted under the 2007-2013 Programme are pursued, with some adaptation. Some actions are substantially reduced or no longer implemented because they are no longer relevant, while some new actions are launched with a limited level of ambition (for instance on redress). It corresponds to a budget equal to or lower than the one provided under the current Programme. ·  Option 2 corresponds to a more ambitious approach in line with Commission priorities (Europe 2020, Single Market Act) and the on-going reflection on the future of consumer policy. The budget under this option is around EUR 25 millions annually. ·  Option 3 would require a budget increase compared to the current Programme for some additional actions such as the development of a public consumer product safety Database, and in matters of redress: setting up a fund to support the financing of cross-border redress actions. The impact assessment has concluded that option 2 is the best option from a cost/benefit point of view. LEGAL BASIS: Article 169 TFUE. CONTENT : the aim of the Consumer Programme is to contribute to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers, as well as to promote their right to information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests. The Programme will complement, support and monitor the policies of Member States. The actions will support the following four specific objectives: Objective 1 - safety : to consolidate and enhance product safety through effective market surveillance throughout the Union. This objective will be measured in particular through the activity of the EU rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products (RAPEX). Objective 2 - information and education : to improve consumers' education, information and awareness of their rights, to develop the evidence base for consumer policy and to provide support to consumer organisations. Objective 3 - rights and redress : to consolidate consumer rights in particular through regulatory action and improving access to redress including alternative dispute resolution. This objective will be measured in particular through the recourse to alternative dispute resolution to solve cross-border disputes and through the activity of a Unionwide on-line dispute resolution system. Objective 4 - enforcement : to support enforcement of consumer rights by strengthening cooperation between national enforcement bodies and by supporting consumers with advice. This objective will be measured in particular through the level of information flow and cooperation within the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network and the activity of the European Consumer Centres. The description of the indicators is provided in Annex II, and the Commission will be empowered to adopt delegated acts to modify the indicators. Eligible actions : the proposal sets out the selected areas for actions which are of three kinds: Actions corresponding to legal obligations imposed by the Treaty and the existing EU acquis in the field of consumer protection on the EU and Member States. This involves financing the maintenance and proper functioning of the RAPEX Network, of the CPC Network of enforcement authorities and of the cosmetics databases. Actions which are not or could not be undertaken at national level because of their EU-level character: ·  assisting consumers on cross-border issues by co-financing the operation of the Network of European Consumer Centres (ECCs) and by supporting the development of a Union-wide on-line dispute resolution system dealing also with cross-border cases; ·  developing cooperation with international partners to deal with the impact of the globalisation of the production chain on product safety; ·  supporting the production of EU-level comparable consumer markets data for benchmarking between Member States and input into EU-level policy-making; ·  ensuring EU-level representation of consumer interests by financially supporting EU-level consumer organisations. Actions complementing and enhancing the efficiency of measures undertaken at national level: ·  coordination and co-financing of joint actions in the field of product safety and of consumer rights enforcement; ·  supporting awareness-raising campaigns on consumer issues with Member States and other stakeholders and working with intermediaries to contribute to the provisions of clear, transparent and reliable information to consumers; ·  supporting the training of national consumer organisations, which would be much more costly at national level without economy of scale; ·  providing a platform for exchange and sharing of good practices in the field of consumer education. A more detailed description of the content that those actions may have is included in Annex I. Participation of third countries in the Programme : participation in the Programme shall be open to the participation of: ·  the countries of the European Free Trade Associations participating in the European Economic Area; ·  third countries, in particular acceding and candidate countries as well as potential candidates, and countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy applies. Types of intervention and maximum level of co-financing : financial contributions by the Union may take the form of either grants or public procurement. The proposal describes in detail the types of intervention in relation to eligible actions. Grants for the functioning of consumer organisations at Union level may be awarded to European consumer organisations, which comply with certain conditions set out in the proposal as well as grants for eligible actions. Financial framework and co-financing : the financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme shall be EUR 197,000,000 from 2014 to 2020. The rate of co-financing depends on the type of action being financed, Grants for functioning range from 50% to 95% of eligible costs in certain cases. Grants for action range from 50% to 70% of eligible costs. Administrative and technical assistance : the financial allocation for the Programme may also cover expenses pertaining to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities which are required for the management of the programme and the achievement of its objectives; in particular, studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions, including corporate communication of the political priorities of the Union, expenses linked to IT networks focusing on information processing and exchange, together with all other technical and administrative assistance expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme. Methods of implementation : the Commission shall implement the Programme. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers will be conferred on the Commission in respect of the adoption of annual work programmes. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Consistency and complementarity with other policies: the Commission shall, in cooperation with the Member States, ensure overall consistency and complementarity between the Programme and other relevant Union policies, instruments and actions. Evaluation and dissemination of results : standard clauses for monitoring, control, dissemination and anti-fraud measures are inserted in the proposal. Report: no later then mid-2018, an evaluation report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of all the measures (at the level of results and impacts), the efficiency of the use of resources and its European added value, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the measures. Repeal: Decision No 1926/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council is repealed from 1 January 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial appropriations for implementing the Programme over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 will amount to EUR 197 millions in current prices. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU is delegated to the Commission in respect of the adaptation of the indicators set out in Annex II. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council."
4629EP7,"""""European Banking Authority and prudential supervision of credit institutions""""",0.456,0.806,0.895,0.323,0.242,0.807,0.892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"OBJECTIVE: to amend Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) with a view to ensuring a high, effective and consistent level of prudential regulation and supervision across the European Union in the context of creating a banking union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the establishment of the European Banking Authority (EBA) by Regulation (EU) No. 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), and of the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) already contributed to improved cooperation between national supervisors and to the development of a single rulebook for financial services in the EU. However, supervision of banks remains to a large extent within national boundaries and thereby fails to keep up with integrated banking markets. In May 2012, the Commission therefore called for the creation of a banking union to restore confidence in banks and in the euro. Among the key elements of the banking union will be a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) with direct oversight of banks, to enforce prudential rules in a strict and impartial manner and perform effective oversight of cross border banking markets. On 29 June 2012, the Euro area Heads of State or Government called on the Commission to present proposals to provide for a single supervisory mechanism involving the European Central Bank (ECB). The European Council in its conclusions of 29 June 2012 invited the President of the European Council to develop, in close collaboration with the President of the Commission, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the ECB, a specific and time-bound road map for the achievement of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. To avoid fragmentation of the internal market following the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism, the proper functioning of the EBA needs to be ensured. The role of the EBA should therefore be preserved in order to further develop the single rulebook and ensure convergence of supervisory practices throughout the EU. Along with the proposal for a Council Regulation conferring specific tasks on the ECB concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions in accordance with Article 127(6) TFEU, this proposal introduces targeted amendments to the Regulation establishing the European Banking Authority. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has taken into account the analysis done in the context of the adoption of the ""supervisory package"" creating the European Supervisory Authorities, which assessed operational, governance, financial and legal aspects relevant to the establishment of a SSM. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal is limited to an adjustment of the procedural modalities under which the EBA operates to take account of the conferral of supervisory tasks on the ECB and to ensure that the EBA can continue to pursue its functions to protect the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the internal market for financial services and maintaining the stability of the financial system within the internal market. It does not alter the balance of respective competences between the EBA and national authorities. The proposal deals in particular with the following points: EBA powers, in particular binding mediation/emergency situations : in order to ensure that the EBA can carry out its tasks to settle disagreements and also act in emergency situations in relation to the ECB, a new provision is introduced to provide for a specific procedure in relation to the decision taken by the EBA. The procedure provides that if the ECB does not comply with an action by EBA to settle a disagreement or to address an emergency situation, it should be required to explain its reasons. In that unlikely case, where the relevant requirements are set out in directly applicable Union law, the EBA can adopt an individual decision addressed to the financial institution concerned to enforce its action, and it is normally expected to do so. Voting modalities : the fact that the ECB will coordinate the position of the Euro area Member States requires a review of the voting modalities currently provided for in the EBA regulation, in order to ensure that EBA decisions are taken in the interest of maintaining and strengthening the internal market for financial services. Composition of the Management Board : in view of the decisive influence of members from Member States participating in or closely cooperating with the single supervisory mechanism when electing the Management Board (simple majority of members present), members from Member States not participating in the SSM could not be appropriately represented adequately in the Management Board. To ensure a balanced composition of the Management Board, reflecting the EU as a whole and including Member States not participating in the single supervisory mechanism, the proposal amends the composition of the Management Board of the EBA to ensure that at least two members from Member States not participating in the single supervisory mechanism are represented in the Management Board. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (known as COP 21), which took place in Paris from 30 November to 12 December 2015, the text of an agreement was adopted, concerning the strengthening of the global response to climate change. In its communication assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement, the Commission stated that the Paris Agreement should be signed and ratified as soon as possible. In its conclusions of 18 March 2016, the European Council underlined the need for the European Union and its Member States to conclude the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and on time so as to be parties as of its entry into force. As a first step, the Agreement was signed by the Commission and Council on behalf of the European Union and by all 28 Member States on their behalf at the high-level signature ceremony which took place in New York on 22 April 2016. The Paris Agreement is in conformity with the environmental objectives of the Union as referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty, namely preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; protecting human health; and promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. The 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the EU sets an ambitious economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 40% domestically by 2030, as well as renewable energy and energy efficiency targets of at least 27%. Implementing the 2030 energy and climate framework is a priority in follow up to the Paris Agreement. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement is a global milestone for enhancing global collective action and accelerating the global transformation to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. It will replace the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, that contains commitments until the end of 2020. These commitments will not be continued beyond 2020. The Paris Agreement sets out a qualitative long-term emissions reduction goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C. In order to achieve this goal, the parties will prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. Starting from 2023, parties will every 5 years undertake a global stocktake, based on the latest science and implementation to date, which will track progress and consider emission reductions, adaptation and support provided. The Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. The Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, which establishes a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement, was signed in London on 30 July 2009. The Interim Partnership Agreement has been provisionally applied by Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Samoa since 20 December 2009, 28 July 2014 and 31 December 2018, respectively. The Agreement lays down the provisions regarding the accession of other Pacific Island States. In accordance with the Agreement, Solomon Islands submitted to the Council on 4 June 2018 an application for membership and an offer of market access. The Commission examined Solomon Islands' offer and, after modifications, has found it acceptable. Accordingly, the Commission concluded negotiations with Solomon Islands on 23 October 2018. CONTENT: the draft Council decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of Solomon Islands' accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Union, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, subject to the deposit of the Act of Accession by Solomon Islands. The EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement, which offers asymmetric market access to Solomon Islands and allows it to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation, while providing a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection. It further contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate Solomon Islands' exports into the EU. Over the course of its implementation, the EPA will largely relieve EU exporters of industrial products to Solomon Islands from paying customs duties. Indeed, the EPA covers 90.3% of tariff lines, or 83% of the EU's export volume over 15 years. The Agreement also contains provisions on sustainable development. In accordance with the Agreement, the Union and Solomon Islands are to apply the Agreement on a provisional basis ten days after they have notified each other in writing that the necessary procedures have been completed."
2998EP7,"""""Major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances""""",0.667,0.832,0.807,0.516,0.515,0.795,0.856,0.629,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to revise Directive 96/82/EC (Directive Seveso II) due to changes in the EU system of classification of dangerous substances to which the Directive refers. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. . BACKGROUND: Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (the Seveso II directive) is aimed at preventing major accidents involving large quantities of dangerous substances (or mixtures thereof) as listed in its Annex I and to limit the consequences of such accidents for man and the environment. The Directive, which applies to around 10 000 establishments in the EU, has contributed to reducing the probability and consequences of such accidents and increasing the level of protection in the Union. It must, however, be amended due to changes in the EU system of classification of dangerous substances to which the Directive refers. The review process, which was launched in 2008, revealed that that overall the existing provisions are fit for purpose and that no major changes are required. However, a number of areas were identified where limited amendments would be appropriate in order to clarify and update certain provisions and to improve implementation and enforceability while maintaining or slightly increasing the level of protection for health and environment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main problems covered in the impact assessment related to the alignment of Annex I to Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (the CLP Regulation) and the impact on the scope of the Directive, which was the key issue. Other issues related to information to the public and information management systems and land-use planning, and other detailed provisions which could usefully be clarified or updated. · As regards the alignment of Annex I, the Commission is proposing the option that, in addition to a very limited impact on scope shared with other options, maintains a high level of protection taking into account the most likely and relevant exposure routes in the event of a major accident. To deal with situations arising over time from the alignment where substances are included/excluded under the Directive that do/do not present a major-accident hazard, a package of corrective mechanisms to adapt Annex I via delegated acts is proposed. · As regards information to the public, etc, it is proposed to improve the level and quality of information and how this is collected, managed, made available, updated and shared in an efficient and streamlined way. LEGAL BASE: Article 192(1) (protection of the environment) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main reason for the revision of the Seveso II Directive is to align its Annex I to Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of dangerous substances and mixtures ( the CLP Regulation), which amends and repeals Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC to which the Seveso II Directive currently refers. The CLP rules become definitive with effect from 1 June 2015. The main changes relate to health hazards . The former category ""Very Toxic"" has been aligned to the CLP category ""Acute Toxic 1"" and ""Toxic"" to ""Acute Toxic 2"" (all exposure routes) and ""Acute Toxic 3"" (dermal and inhalation routes.) Several more specific CLP categories for physical hazards that did not exist before replace the more general old categories for oxidizing, explosive, and flammable hazards. For the new category of flammable aerosols, the thresholds have been adapted proportionately to those that apply currently based on their flammable properties and components; and for reasons of consistency, the group of pyrophoric substances has been completed by the inclusion of pyrophoric solids. The new Annex I Part 2 retains the old Part 1 largely unchanged. The only changes are the following: (i) an updated reference to the CLP Regulation for liquefied flammable gases; (ii) the inclusion of anhydrous ammonia, boron triflouride, and hydrogen sulphide as named substances, previously covered by their hazard categories, to keep their thresholds unchanged; (iii) the inclusion of heavy fuel oil in the entry for petroleum products; (iv) clarifications to the notes in relation to ammonium nitrate; (v) and an update of the toxic equivalency factors for dioxins. Among the excluded areas are the offshore exploration and exploitation of minerals, including hydrocarbons. The Commission will assess the appropriate way to strengthen environmental legislation with provisions that may be necessary to complement existing environmental legislation in relation to pollution control, inspection and accident prevention and management as regards individual offshore installations, ensuring a high level of protection of the environment in such activities. Corresponding legislative proposals will include either extending the scope of existing legislation to offshore oil and gas installations or a stand-alone initiative for such operations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."
5226EP7,"""""Competitiveness of enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (2014 - 2020)""""",0.684,0.795,0.772,0.484,0.394,0.807,0.815,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises for the period 2014 – 2020. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an important contributor to growth and employment in the Union. If the Union is to deliver its Europe 2020 priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, competitiveness needs to be centre stage. While regulatory means are at the Union's disposal, including smart legislation and cutting red tape for Union enterprises, some market failures can be addressed effectively through public funding at EU level. This is already happening. The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) provides funding for relevant action. The need to continue and develop such financial support was recognised in the Commission Communication “A budget for Europe 2020”. Accordingly, the Commission has proposed a ""Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs"" (COSME) as a means of addressing key market failures that limit the growth of enterprises, particularly SMEs, in the Union. The Programme is designed to create the conditions for European enterprises to flourish and to ensure that SMEs are able to take full advantage of the Single Market's enormous potential, as well as encouraging them to look beyond it. There needs to be a special effort to promote the development of SMEs, a major source of economic growth and job creation in the Union, accounting for more than 67 % of private sector jobs and providing more than 58 % of total turnover in the EU. It should also be noted that particular attention will be given to improve the competitiveness of enterprises in the tourism sector to implement the new competencies of the Union provided for in the Lisbon Treaty, the reason being the significant contribution of this sector to the Union’s GDP and the high proportion of SMEs active in this sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment covering the instruments of the Programme was carried out and it accompanies this Commission proposal. The impact assessment considered four options: ·  Option 1 status quo : this would cover the same competitiveness- and SME-related elements as the EIP is expected to cover in 2013; ·  Option 2 : this would discontinue all current financial interventions. ·  Option 3b : this option would maintain the current scope of intervention with a balanced budgetary expansion; ·  Option 3c: this would mean a focused budgetary expansion, with financial support restricted to the financial instruments and the Enterprise Europe Network. The impact assessment has concluded that modest budgetary expansion is the preferred option (3b), as it would provide a balanced approach in terms of supporting efficiency gains, critical mass, coherence and effectiveness, and tackling market and regulatory failures. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 173 and 195 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to establish a programme for Union actions to improve the competitiveness of enterprises, with special emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. General objectives : the Programme aims to: ·  strengthen the competitiveness and sustainability of the Union’s enterprises including in the tourism sector; ·  encourage an entrepreneurial culture and promoting the creation and growth of SMEs. The achievement of these objectives shall be measured by certain indicators which are specified in the proposal. Specific objectives : the specific objectives of the Programme shall be: (1) to improve framework conditions for the competitiveness and sustainability of Union enterprises including in the tourism sector; (2) to promote entrepreneurship, including among specific target groups; (3) to improve access to finance for SMEs in the form of equity and debt; (4) to improve access to markets inside the Union and globally. (1) Improve framework conditions for the competitiveness and sustainability of Union enterprises including in the tourism sector by supporting coherence and consistency in implementation as well as informed policy-making at Union level. Union actions will include: ·  reinforcing the use of the “Think Small First” principle in Union and Member State policy-making; ·  identifying and exchanging best practices to contribute to implementing the Small Business Act; and ·  supporting SMEs in making the most of the Single Market's potential. Business sectors, including manufacturing and services, and selected sectors in which there are a high proportion of SMEs will be strengthened. (2) Promoting entrepreneurship, including among specific target groups: activities will include: ·  simplifying administrative procedures; ·  developing entrepreneurial skills and ·  attitudes, especially among new entrepreneurs, young people and women; ·  promoting second chances for entrepreneurs. (3) Improving access to finance for SMEs in the form of equity and debt: financial instruments for growth, including new equity and debt platforms to provide equity facility and loan guarantees, will enable SMEs to access funding more easily: ·  an equity facility for growth-phase investment will provide SMEs with commercially-oriented reimbursable equity financing primarily in the form of venture capital through financial intermediaries; ·  a loan facility will provide SMEs with direct or other risk-sharing arrangements with financial intermediaries to cover loans. An annex gives details of the actions linked to improving SME financing. (4) Improving access to markets inside the Union and globally: growth-oriented business support services will be provided via the Enterprise Europe Network to facilitate expansion in the Single Market and beyond. This Programme will also provide SME business support in markets outside the Union. There will also be support for international industrial cooperation, particularly to reduce differences in regulatory and business environments between the EU and its main trading partners. The proposal also contains provisions covering expenses pertaining to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities. Management and implementation of the Programme : management will be largely outsourced: ·  the financial instruments will be operated by the European Investment Bank Group on behalf of the Commission; ·  other actions may be managed by an executive agency, building on the positive experience with the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI) in the current multi-annual financial framework. The use of one executive agency will also lead to a streamlined use of IT tools and electronic portals, thus further contributing to easier access for SMEs. In order to implement the Programme, the Commission shall adopt an annual work programme, which will set out the objectives pursued, the expected results, the method of implementation and their total amount. The work programme will also contain a description of the actions to be financed, an indication of the amount allocated to each action and an indicative implementation timetable. It shall include for grants the priorities, the essential evaluation criteria and the maximum rate of co-financing. Simplification: a priority for the Commission in this Programme, as in other programmes within the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate access to funds for EU enterprises, particularly SMEs, as far as possible. This approach is applied in the Competitiveness and SME Programme (COSME) by basing it solely on the rules of the Financial Regulation, without any derogation. This provides for simple, coherent and standardised administrative procedures for enterprises to access funds. The revision of the Financial Regulation will help to make it easier for small enterprises to take part in funding programmes, for example by: ·  simplifying rules; ·  reducing the costs of participation; ·  accelerating award procedures and ·  providing a ""one-stop shop"""" to make access to Union funding easier. A new system of lump sums is proposed. To allow for an improved access to funding for SMEs, the rules for participation and eligibility of all future Union funding programmes will be aligned to the greatest extent possible. Financial instruments : financial instruments as such are simple to use for enterprises as they address their bank or venture capital fund with an ordinary financing request and not with a project proposal as for grant finance. As regards the financial instruments to be implemented by the European Investment Fund (EIF) or other appropriate financial institutions, the Commission proposal for the equity and debt platforms and the revised Financial Regulation will govern the financial instruments’ administrative requirements. The rules will be simplified to the greatest extent possible, to strike a balance between reporting obligations on intermediaries and beneficiaries on the one hand, and sound financial management, including audit requirements, on the other. In addition, the simplified procedures developed by the EACI will be taken over by the Commission for similar types of projects. Best practices will be shared as regards, for example, simplifications the Agency introduced in grant agreements, contracts and procedures. Further simplification might include more flexible implementation modalities for grant agreements to avoid the need for amendments at a later stage. Participation of third countries : the Programme shall be open to the participation of: ·  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA), in accordance with the conditions laid down in the EEA Agreement, and other European countries when agreements and procedures so allow; ·  acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates in accordance with the general principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of those countries in Union's programmes; ·  countries falling under the scope of the European neighbourhood policies, when agreements and procedures so allow. Monitoring and evaluation : the Commission shall monitor the implementation and management of the Programme. It shall draw up an annual monitoring report examining the efficiency and effectiveness of supported actions in terms of financial implementation, results and, where possible, impact. By 2018 at the latest, the Commission shall establish an evaluation report on the achievement of the objectives of all the actions supported under the Programme. Repeal and transitional provisions : Decision 1639/2006/EC is repealed with effect from 1 January 2014. However, actions initiated under Decision 1639/2006/EC and financial obligations related to those actions shall continue to be governed by that Decision until their completion. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial appropriations for implementing the Programme for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 shall amount to EUR 2.522 billion of which approximately EUR 1.4 billion shall be allocated to financial instruments. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union particularly in respect of specific rules for participation and externalisation of certain tasks."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the Schengen acquis, third-country nationals who are legally resident or staying in a Member State can move freely within the territory of the other Member States, provided they fulfil certain conditions. However, in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. Following the Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the technical work carried out in the Health Security Committee and the e-Health network, the Commission has put forward (in parallel with this proposal) a proposal for a Digital Green Certificate Regulation to establish an EU-wide framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework set out in the proposal for a Regulation on a digital green certificate applies to Union citizens or their family members who may be a third country national. This proposal has the objective of ensuring that the same framework applies to other third-country nationals who are legally staying or legally residing on the territory of an EU Member State and who are entitled to travel to another Member State in accordance with Union law. CONTENT: the proposal aims to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates of COVID-19 vaccination, testing and recovery. In concrete terms, the interoperable green digital certificate will prove that a person has been vaccinated against, tested negative for or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available free of charge, either electronically or paper format, and will include a QR code to ensure its security and authenticity. Member States should apply the rules set out in the future Regulation on a digital green certificate to third-country nationals who do not fall within the scope of that Regulation but who are legally resident or staying in their territory and are authorised to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. This proposal establishes neither an obligation nor a right to vaccination. Vaccination strategies are a national competence of the Member States. The proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The digital green certificate would thus be open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland."

CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to create a common set of simplified and consolidated rules covering seven EU funds. The main elements of the Commission proposal are as follows: Shared management and partnership : part of the budget of the Union allocated to the Funds should be implemented by the Commission under shared management with Member States. Each Member State should organise partnerships with local and regional authorities, urban and public authorities, economic and social partners, civil society and bodies promoting social inclusion, fundamental rights, gender equality, non-discrimination and the rights of people with disabilities. The contribution of EU programmes to the overall objective of increasing the share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25% shall be tracked through an EU climate marker system. Strategic approach : the Commission proposes to reduce the eleven thematic objectives used for the period 2014-2020 to five clear policy objectives: a smarter Europe by promoting innovative and smart economic transformation; a greener, low-carbon Europe by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular economy, climate adaptation and risk prevention and management; a more connected Europe by enhancing mobility and regional ICT connectivity; a more social Europe implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights; a Europe closer to citizens by fostering the sustainable and integrated development of urban, rural and coastal areas and local initiatives. Simplification : the proposal aims at significantly reducing the unnecessary administrative burden for beneficiaries and management bodies while maintaining a high level of assurance on legality and regularity. Among other things, it provides for: the use of simplified cost options, i.e. flat-rate reimbursement, standard scales of unit costs or flat-rate amounts; the possibility of payments based on conditions; the abolition of specific rules for revenue generating investments and of the procedure applicable to major projects; simplified financing, for example through the use of the ‘seal of excellence’; the extension of the single audit principle, fewer controls and an enhanced proportionate approach for programmes with a low error rate. The proposal also increases the flexibility needed to meet emerging needs: allowing limited financial transfers between EU programmes; creating flexibility for the ERDF, ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund: only the first 5 years will be programmed initially. Allocations for the last 2 years will be made on the basis of a substantial and in-depth mid-term review leading to corresponding reprogramming in 2025; enabling voluntary transfer of resources towards the five policy windows of the InvestEU instruments to benefit from an EU-level budgetary guarantee mechanism. Lastly, the proposal seeks to align the programmes more closely with EU priorities and increase their effectiveness, in particular by creating a closer link with the European Semester to improve the investment climate in Europe. Conditionality linked to the European Semester shall be simplified. In particular, country-specific recommendations (CSRs) shall be taken into account in programming at least on two occasions: at the beginning of the programming and during the mid-term review. Proposed overall budget : the Commission proposal for a multiannual financial framework sets an envelope of EUR 330 billion for economic, social and territorial cohesion for the period 2021-2027: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF): EUR 200.62 billion , of which (i) investment for jobs and growth: EUR 190.75 billion; (II) European territorial cooperation: EUR 8.43 billion; (iii) outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 1.44 billion. Cohesion Fund (CF): EUR 41.34 billion , of which contribution to the Connecting Europe Facility - Transport: EUR 10 billion. European Social Fund+: EUR 88.64 billion . The Commission proposal for the financing of the EMFF, AMIF, BMVI and ISF shall be included in fund specific Regulations."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fiscalis 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing cooperation between tax authorities within the Union. The added value of those programmes, including as regards the protection of the financial and economic interests of Member States of the Union and of taxpayers, has been recognised by the tax authorities of the participating countries. The Union and the national tax authorities still suffer from insufficient capacity and insufficient cooperation – both within the EU and with third countries – to carry out effectively and efficiently their missions. They need to provide quick and joint responses to emerging problems such as tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, digitalisation and new business models, while at the same time preventing unnecessary administrative burden for citizens and businesses in cross-border transactions. Therefore, the Commission is proposing a new fiscalis programme under the Single Market, Innovation and Digital budget heading. It shall comprise means and a budget which shall support tax policy and tax authorities through administrative and IT capacity building activities and operational cooperation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the fiscalis programme for cooperation in the field of taxation for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the Fiscalis 2020 programme. Objective : the programme has the general objective to support tax authorities and taxation to enhance the functioning of the single market, foster Union competitiveness and protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States. It supports tax policy, tax cooperation and administrative capacity building, including human competency and the development and operation of the European electronic systems. The programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. The implementation of the programme will occur through the most commonly used spending mechanisms of Union budget, namely public procurement and grants. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation provides mechanisms, means as well as the necessary funding aiming to support tax policy and to improve cooperation between tax authorities. The proposed measure comprises inter alia meetings and similar ad-hoc events, project-based structured collaboration and human competency and capacity building actions, in which Member States and their officials may participate on a voluntary basis. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of common components and national components reflecting better the reality of IT projects and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand, and the Member States on the other hand, have been listed A multi-annual strategic plan for taxation to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. The Commission and the Member States shall ensure jointly the development and operation, including the design, specification, conformance testing, deployment, maintenance, evolution, security, quality assurance and quality control, of the European electronic systems listed in the multi-annual strategic plan for taxation. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 270 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: by Decision of 30 November 2009, the Council concluded the agreement between the European Community and the Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver. Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and the Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition. With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with the Seychelles were successfully finalised by the initialling of the amending agreement on 15 July 2016. CONTENT: this proposal is presented to the Council to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement between the European Community and the Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver. The amendments introduced by the final agreement cover the following points: Duration of stay: the final agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the Seychelles when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). A joint statement on the interpretation of the 90-day period over any 180-day period is attached to the amending agreement. Suspension of the agreement: the agreement provides that suspension of the waiver shall be lifted if the suspension is no longer required. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Community and the Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver remain unaffected by the amending agreement, including the territorial scope. The provisions of the agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Home affairs policies have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. These policies are at the heart of the European project to create an area without internal borders where EU citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. The Commission adopted a proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: a budget for delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. The Commission proposed to simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to a two-Fund structure: an Asylum and Migration Fund and an Internal Security Fund. Experience suggests that in the current programming period, the diversity and fragmentation of rules governing spending programmes are often perceived as unnecessarily complicated and difficult to implement and control. This imposes a heavy administrative burden on beneficiaries as well as on the Commission and Member States, which can have the unintended effect of discouraging participation, increasing error rates and delaying implementation. This means that the potential benefits of Union programmes are not fully realised. This Regulation is part of a package of four Regulations, jointly establishing the framework for Union funding on home affairs under the two Funds. This Regulation lays down rules on programming, management and control, financial management, clearance of accounts, closure of programmes and reporting and evaluation. Thus, it sets out the delivery mechanisms whereas the purpose and scope of the two Funds, the resources and means of implementation are defined in their respective specific Regulations. This horizontal instrument will ensure a common approach to the implementation of the two Funds and a uniform treatment of beneficiaries in relation to all Union support in the area of home affairs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: i accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. The impact assessment identified problems in relation to the scope and priorities of the current home affairs spending programmes on the one hand and the problems regarding the delivery of funding on the other hand. In relation to the latter, the impact assessment examined options in relation to shared management, centralised management and the timely response to emergency situations. In relation to shared management , the impact assessment concluded that a multiannual programme preceded by a policy dialogue was the preferred option. Contrary to the status quo, which combines annual programmes within a multiannual framework, it would significantly reduce administrative workload. In terms of improving the delivery of funding under centralised management , the status quo was discarded because it offers little or no prospect of simplification or reduction of administrative workload. Recourse to a more targeted, less resource-intensive and diversified centralised management is the preferred option because it is expected to improve relations with key stakeholders and to lead to an overall reduction in workload. In relation to the emergency response mechanism , the impact assessment concluded that the current mechanism clearly does not meet the need for a quicker and more effective response to crises in the areas of migration and security. An improved mechanism extended to both a wider range of migration-related crises and security-related crises was considered the preferred option. Stakeholders supported the idea of reducing the number of financial instruments to a two-Fund structure on the condition that this would actually lead to simplification. They also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism to allow the Union to respond quickly and effectively to migration and security-related crises. Shared management with a move to multi-annual programming with the definition of common targets at Union level was generally seen as the appropriate management method for all home affairs spending although non-governmental organisations were of the view that direct management should also be continued . LEGAL BASIS: Articles 78(2), 79(2), 79(4), 82(1), 84 and 87(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In light of this legal basis, the provisions of this Regulation lay down horizontal common provisions for the implementation of the Asylum and Migration Fund and one component of the Internal Security Fund, namely the instrument for financial support for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management. CONTENT: this Regulation lays down obligations only of a financial and technical nature and leaves the choices on the definition of policy objectives, eligible actions, the allocation of resources and the scope of the intervention for each specific policy area to the respective legal basis (i.e. in the Specific Regulations). As a new general framework for implementing Union funding in the area of home affairs policies, this Regulation sets outs general rules on the financing of expenditure including rules on partnership, programming, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, the management and control systems to be put in place by the Member States and the clearance of accounts. General principles : the proposed Regulation seeks to lay down the conditions for: a more policy-driven and results-oriented funding, including through reinforced strategic programming; a significant simplification of the delivery mechanisms compared to the current situation; more flexibility in financial management and in the implementation, in light of the need to be able to address new and unforeseen circumstances typical of home affairs; an enhanced monitoring and evaluation framework, ensuring accountability, transparency and informed reflection on future support in the area of home affairs. The main principles are detailed as follows: (1) A policy-driven and results-oriented agenda (a) For shared management : at the beginning of the next Multiannual Financial Framework, there will be a single, overarching home affairs policy dialogue with each Member State on their use of the Funds. Taking into account the outcome of the policy dialogue, the programmes agreed between the Commission and the Member State will describe the baseline situation and lay down the objectives Member States are to achieve in the policy area and the objectives for the use of Union funding. The national programme will identify targets and examples of actions per objective. In addition, a seven-year financial plan will indicate how the allocated resources are to be committed and spent, within the ceilings available. In case of actions to be implemented in and in relation to third countries, such actions should not be directly development-oriented and the policy dialogue should seek full coherence with the principles and general objectives of the Union external action and foreign policy related to the country or region in question. It is also provides that: Member States will report annually on financial management and the results achieved under the programmes; there will be a mid-term review in 2017 to re-examine the situation in each Member State. At this occasion, new resources can be allocated for the period 2018-2020. (b) For direct and indirect management : the objectives to be achieved under the national programmes will be complemented by ""Union actions"" as well as a rapid response mechanism to deal with emergency situations. Union actions will support the implementation of Union policies through grants and procurement. They will include actions in and in relation to third countries as indicated in the Communication on the Multiannual Financial Framework. Such actions shall not be directly development oriented and shall complement, as appropriate, the financial assistance provided through the EU's external aid instruments. Union actions and emergency assistance measures may also be carried out by Union Agencies in the area of home affairs (Cepol, Europol, EASO, Frontex and the IT Agency). Technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission will be used to support Member States and beneficiaries, to encourage mutual learning and improve communication (including corporate communication where appropriate) and evaluation. These appropriations will also support adequate control measures in the Union and in third countries relating to actions funded. (2) Simplification of delivery mechanisms (a) For shared management : each Member State will be required to have a single national programme per Fund, thus bringing together various policy areas. The new framework represents a major simplification and reduction of administrative burden compared to the current four Funds, which work with both a multiannual strategy and annual programmes. a low number of revisions of national programmes are expected (there should be, per Member State and per Fund, one decision to approve the multiannual programme and, if needed, one decision to revise the programme in the context of the mid-term review); each Member States will set up a single management and control system per Fund, with the possibility of having one system to cover both Funds; the eligibility of expenditure shall be determined on the basis of national rules, subject to a limited number of common, simple principles (simplified cost options such as flat rates and lump sums in particular). (b) For direct and indirect management : - in the event of emergency situations: the mechanism shall be triggered by the Commission, also following the initiative of Member States, the Article 71 Committee (COSI) represented by the respective Union Presidency or other stakeholders such as international organisations, etc; all possible means will be used to avoid fragmentation by concentrating resources on a limited number of Union objectives; - for the financial support to the development of new IT systems (""the smart borders package""), the current annual financial decisions enabling the Commission to develop the central parts will be replaced by a multiannual framework. (3) Flexibility (a) For shared management : the impact of the mid-term review will depend on the situation in the Member States. Member States which are deemed to have additional risks or which obtain additional resources to implement Union specific priorities would be invited to revise the amounts in their financial plan and where appropriate to add elements in their programme. Financial flexibility will be implemented notably through the different mechanisms provided by these proposals, bearing in mind as central phases for their implementation the multiannual financial programming and its annual update, the annual budget allocation and the annual budget implementation. (b) For direct and indirect management : annual appropriations for Union actions, emergency assistance and, subject to annual ceilings, the technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission, are considered as one ""envelope"", thereby allowing maximum flexibility to decide from one financial year to another where the resources will be allocated, depending on the specific needs. The specific Regulations foresee implementation in relation to all the policies and objectives supported by the Funds and even financing policy-related aspects of the operation of the Funds. (4) A coherent and efficient reporting, monitoring and evaluation framework (a) For shared management : Member States will report annually on the implementation of the multiannual programme, as an integral part of the clearance of accounts' exercise. To feed into the mid term review process, they will be requested in 2017 to provide additional information on the progress made in achieving the objectives. A similar exercise will be undertaken in 2019, to allow, where appropriate, adjustments during the last financial year (2020). Supporting the development of a evaluation-based culture in the area of home affairs, the Funds will have a common evaluation and monitoring framework with broad policy related indicators which underline the result-oriented approach to the Funds and the essential role they could play in the policy mix to achieve the objectives towards an area of freedom, security and justice. All measures will be established at the beginning of the programming period, thus enabling Member States to set up their reporting and evaluation systems on the basis of the agreed principles and requirements. To reduce the administrative burden and ensure synergies between reporting and evaluation, the information required for evaluation reports will build on and complete the information provided by Member States in the annual implementation reports of the national programmes. The interim evaluation report is due in 2018 and should feed into the reflection on the subsequent programming period. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to amend provisions of this Regulation on the common principles on the eligibility of expenditure, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
2135EP7,"""""Energy market integrity and transparency""""",0.807,0.905,0.86,0.516,0.273,0.892,0.897,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to provide a harmonised framework to ensure energy market transparency and integrity. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it is important to ensure that consumers can have confidence in the integrity of electricity and gas markets and that prices set on wholesale energy markets reflect a fair interplay between supply and demand. Unless effectively addressed, the potential for unfair trading practice undermines public trust, deters investment, increases volatility of energy prices and may lead to higher energy prices in general. To date energy market monitoring practices have been Member State and sector specific. Depending on the overall market framework and regulatory situation, this can result in trading activities being subject to multiple jurisdictions with monitoring carried out by several different authorities, possibly located in different Member States. This can result in a lack of clarity as to where responsibility rests and even to a situation where no such monitoring exists. Energy markets are increasingly interlinked across the Union. Market abuse in one Member State affects wholesale prices for electricity and gas across national borders. Therefore the concern to ensure the integrity of markets cannot be a matter only for individual Member States. In December 2007, the Commission requested the advice of Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas (ERGEG) on issues relating to wholesale energy market transparency and market abuse. In their recommendation, they confirmed that the scope of existing legislation may not properly address market integrity issues on the electricity and gas markets and recommended the consideration of an appropriate legislative framework in the energy sector, preventing market abuse. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is accompanied by an Impact Assessment which examines the options for ensuring energy market integrity and transparency in detail. LEGAL BASE: Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This Article states that in the context of the establishment and functioning of the internal market Union policy on energy shall aim, inter alia, to ensure the functioning of the energy market. CONTENT: as a result the gaps identified by CESR and ERGEG, the main elements of the proposed Regulation are as follows: Clear and consistent rules : the Regulation develops rules which clearly prohibit market abuse on wholesale markets in electricity and related products, and wholesale markets in natural gas and related products. These rules include clear prohibitions on trading on insider information, and market manipulation. These rules are formulated in such a way that they are consistent with the Market Abuse Directive, and do not apply to financial instruments which are already covered by that Directive. Adaptable and compatible rules : the Regulation allows these rules to be specified in delegated acts of the Commission. Industry responses to the public consultation favoured this approach, which allows the specificities of energy markets, which are subject to change, to be taken into account. Measures for effective detection and deterrence : - Market monitoring : to detect market abuse an effectively functioning market monitor with timely access to complete transactional data is necessary. EU level market monitoring can take the holistic view needed for the monitoring of energy markets. The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators has the necessary expertise in energy markets, and institutional connections with national energy regulators for this role. The Regulation provides for the Agency to gather, review and share data from wholesale energy markets. Member State authorities, including national regulatory authorities, financial regulators and competition authorities, have a direct interest in the market results and bring a vital understanding of the markets in their jurisdiction. Therefore cooperation between the Agency and national authorities is central to the monitoring foreseen. - Data Reporting : the Regulation requires market participants to provide the Agency with a record of their transactions in wholesale energy products. The form, content and timing of the information to be provided will be laid down in delegated acts of the Commission. These will be based on draft guidelines developed by the Agency. These guidelines will provide for several channels for the reporting of data. This will minimise the burden on market participants and avoid double reporting obligations on entities covered by the Market Abuse Directive. - Investigation and Enforcement : market monitoring will be accompanied by effective investigation where market abuse is suspected, where necessary leading to appropriate sanctions. The Regulation gives national regulatory authorities the lead role in this, requiring Member States to grant them the necessary powers to investigate suspected market abuse and to lay down appropriate rules on the penalties applicable in case of violations of the Regulation. The Regulation also recognises that the cross border nature of energy markets means that cooperation will be crucial. In this ACER is given an important role. In close contact with energy regulators and financial supervisors it will ensure that a consistent approach is taken to suspected market abuse, alerting national regulatory authorities to potential market abuse and facilitating information exchange. This coordination role will be particularly important when an investigation covers several Member States or it is unclear where the suspected market abuse actually occurred. The Regulation provides for the possibility for an investigatory group to be established, coordinated by the Agency but made up of representatives of concerned national regulatory authorities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total appropriations to cover the new tasks of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators is estimated at EUR 1.315 million in 2012 and EUR 1.613 in 2013. These amounts cover the equipment, operating costs, mission expenditure for the new task and human resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the aim of this proposal is to amend Directive 2004/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields). In 2006, the medical community informed the Commission of its concerns regarding the implementation of this Directive, claiming that the exposure limit values laid down therein would limit to a disproportionate extent the use and development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), considered today to be a vital tool for the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases. Subsequently, other industrial sectors also expressed their concerns about the impact of the Directive on their activities. In response to these concerns, the Commission has taken a number of measures. In particular, it asked the Member States to inform it of any difficulties associated with implementation of the Directive and launched a study to assess the actual impact of the Directive on medical procedures using MRI. Meanwhile, in order to: allow a full analysis of the studies; take into account the results of the review of the new International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) recommendations and finally, conduct an in-depth impact analysis of the Directive’s provisions, the deadline for transposition was put back from 30 April 2008 to 30 April 2012. MRI issue : during the discussions preceding its adoption, the specific case of medical resonance imaging was discussed in detail by both the Council and the European Parliament. In the absence of any evidence of an undesirable impact, the joint legislators adopted the Directive, with certain amendments to the values originally proposed by the Commission, in particular not setting an exposure limit value for static magnetic fields, an essential component of MRI, because this value was being amended in the light of the latest scientific findings, which appeared as the Directive was being adopted. This proposal maintains a number of important principles and provisions in the present Directive, such as: the exposure limit values and action values for electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 300 GHz; provisions aimed at avoiding or reducing risk; medical surveillance, etc. The most important changes introduced by the proposal, taking into account the latest scientific findings in this area, are the following: clearer definitions, in particular for adverse health effects (Article 2 of Directive 2004/40/EC); inclusion of a revised system for limit and reference values different from the current limit values and action values for the range from 0 to 100 kHz (this will affect Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2004/40/EC plus its annex); introduction of indicators to facilitate measurements and calculations; introduction of limited but appropriate flexibility by proposing a controlled framework for limited derogations for industry; special attention to the specific case of medical applications using magnetic resonance and related activities. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: from discussions and consultations with stakeholders, the following options emerged: Policy option A: ‘Do nothing’ . Policy option B: ‘New Directive with revised exposure limits’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by a new Directive with revised exposure limit values that are higher than the previous ones, but are in line with scientific evidence. Policy option C1: ‘New Directive with revised exposure limits and partial exemptions’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by a new Directive with revised exposure limit values higher than the previous ones, but in line with scientific evidence (as in option B). In addition, conditional exemptions are provided for MRI, which will however remain subject to the general EMF risk management requirements and covered by the new Directive. Policy option C2: ‘New Directive with revised exposure limits and complete exemption for MRI’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by a new Directive with revised exposure limit values higher than the previous ones, but in line with scientific evidence (as in option B). Medical MRI will be exempted entirely from all the requirements of the EMF Directive. Policy option D1: ‘Replacement of the Directive by a Recommendation’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by non-binding occupational EMF exposure recommendations, based on the latest international recommendations. The form of these recommendations would be similar to the Council Recommendation on EMF exposure of the general public (1999/519/EEC). Policy option D2: ‘Voluntary agreements between the social partners’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is replaced by voluntary agreements at European or sectoral level between social partners in accordance with Article 154(4) TFEU. Policy option E: ‘No EU legislation’ : Directive 2004/40/EC is repealed while Directive 89/391/EEC (Framework Directive) and existing national regulatory provisions on the subject remain in force. The absence of national regulations in some Member States will allow unregulated occupational EMF exposures. For this option, it may be assumed that for example those countries which have already (partially) implemented the EMF Directive would not repeal their EMF legislation. The current proposal is in line with Option C1. C1 is also acceptable for a large majority of stakeholders. The compliance costs are higher than for option E but lower than for option A, which will be the situation as from 1 May 2012 if Directive 2004/40/EC remains in force. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends the relevant articles and annexes of Directive 2004/40/EC in order to achieve a clear, simple and precise text, which is transparent and readily understandable to the public and economic operators. This proposal maintains a number of important principles and provisions in the present Directive, such as: coverage of all sectors of activity , exposure limit values and action values for electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 300 GHz, provisions aimed at avoiding or reducing risk, information and training of workers, consultation and participation of workers, The most important changes introduced by the proposal, taking into account the latest scientific findings in this area, are the following: Clearer definitions, in particular for adverse health effects : a new Article 2 defines ‘electromagnetic fields’, ‘exposure limit values’ and ‘action values’, as was the case in Directive 2004/40/EC. The new article also defines the ‘orientation values’ introduced in the proposal and ‘adverse health effects’ and 'adverse safety effects' for the sake of clarification. Revised system for limit and reference values : the new Directive shall include a revised system for limit and reference values different from the current limit values and action values for the range from 0 to 100 kHz. In addition: Article 3 refers to the exposure limit values and action values as in Directive 2004/40/EC. However, paragraph 1 briefly sets out the roles of the new orientation and action values in order to achieve the proportionality required by stakeholders. This applies to the frequency range from 0 Hz to 100 kHz. From 100 kHz to 300GHz, the levels remain the same as in Directive 2004/40/EC, as no new recommendations have been published since 1998. Paragraph 3 is similar to the corresponding paragraph of Directive 2004/40/EC but has been adapted to limit extensive measurements to cases where they are really necessary. This will in practice simplify the carrying out of the risk assessment for a large majority of workplaces. Paragraph 4 is new and provides an exemption from the exposure limits for the medical MRI sector and related activities, which will continue to be subject to all other obligations. Paragraph 5 is new and provides the right for the military to use a protection system adapted to its specific working situations (e.g. radars). This request was made by NATO, which uses a protection system based on recommendations proposed by IEEE. This system can be considered equivalent to the system set out in this proposal. Paragraph 6 is new and provides for temporary derogations under controlled conditions where the exposure limits are likely to be exceeded. Health surveillance : Article 8 has been amended to introduce a distinction between exposure in the low frequency range (0 Hz to 100 kHz) and exposure in the high frequency range. The change takes into account the fact, confirmed by medical experts, that effects induced by low frequency fields cannot be observed once the worker has left the area of undesired exposure. Any health damage resulting from such exposure therefore cannot be determined by a medical examination. Technical amendments : compared with the same article (Article 10) in Directive 2004/40/EC, significant changes have been introduced. The first paragraph, containing a reference to the legislative procedure laid down in Article 153(2) with regard to the adoption of modifications of the exposure limit values, has been deleted since the proposal itself is based on Article 153(2) of the Treaty and it is not necessary to refer to it again in the enacting terms. The European Parliament and the Council do not empower the Commission to modify the exposure limit values. Any such modifications would therefore not be introduced by the Commission delegated acts but by amendments of the Directive according to the procedure laid down in Article 153(2) TFEU. However, the actual directly measurable reference levels, i.e. the orientation and action values, are considered as amendments of a strictly technical nature. In the light of the new ‘comitology’ rules introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, the purely technical amendments to Annexes referred to in Article 10 are measures of general scope that are designed to amend non-essential elements of the Directive. They thus come under ‘delegated acts’ within the meaning of Article 290 TFEU, and the procedure laid down in that Article (on delegating powers) should be used to adopt those technical amendments. Provision for complementary non-binding measures such as a non-binding practical guide : Article 13 is new and refers to the need to establish a practical guide in order to facilitate implementation of the Directive. Other measures : the proposed revised Directive aims to: introduce some guidance to ensure simplified but more efficient risk assessments in order to facilitate the evaluation work and also to limit the burden on SMEs, introduce limited but appropriate flexibility by proposing a controlled framework for limited derogations for industry. Annexes : Annex I introduces a number of physical quantities not included in the main text (Article 2). This option is considered preferable for better coherence of the text of the proposal. Annex II is an important part of the proposal because it sets out all the elements required to ensure more flexibility and proportionality in the frequency range from 0 Hz to 100 kHz. It introduces in practice the ‘zoning’ system supported by most stakeholders together with measures to facilitate risk assessment procedures whenever possible. Annex III covers the higher end of the frequency spectrum. As there have been no new international recommendations over recent years in this area, the changes are limited to a different presentation and some elements to facilitate the work of employers. Annex IV is specific to medical magnetic resonance (MR). It is designed to ensure the smooth and harmonised application of appropriate qualitative protection measures in a controlled environment. Annex V includes a list of legislative acts amending Directive 2004/40/EC (referred to in Article 15) and a correlation table between the provisions of Directive 2004/40/EC, as amended, and this proposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget except for the meetings of the proposed committees. The appropriations will be taken from the existing budget lines as is usually done for the functioning of the Advisory Committee for Safety and Health at Work (PROGRESS administrative line) and for the invitation of experts (general line). DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in order to empower it to make purely technical amendments of the Annexes to this Directive, in line with the adoption of directives in the field of technical harmonisation and standardisation and as a result of the technical progress, changes in the most relevant harmonised European standards or specifications and new scientific findings concerning electromagnetic fields, as well as to adjust the orientation and action values and the related lists of activities, workplaces and types of equipments. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. In exceptional cases, where imperative grounds of urgency so require, such as possible imminent risks to workers' health and safety arising from their exposure to electromagnetic fields, the possibility should be given to apply the urgency procedure to delegated acts adopted by the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 establishes common technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and as such is an important building block in the realisation of a single euro payments area (SEPA). That Regulation sets 1 February 2014 as the end-date in the Eurozone for the migration of domestic as well as intra-European credit transfers and direct debits in euros towards SEPA credit transfers (SCT) and SEPA direct debits (SDD). Considering the low migration pace in some Member States for SCT and in most Member States for SDD, it appears very unlikely that the SEPA migration will be fully completed on 1 February 2014. However, in view of this legal end-date, banks and other payment service providers are likely to refuse from that date onwards to process legacy payments which are not SEPA compliant. In the absence of full migration to SCT/SDD, payment incidents leading to delays in payment or market disruptions cannot be excluded. These might affect all payment services users, and particularly SMEs and consumers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is not accompanied by a separate impact assessment, as an impact assessment for Regulation (EU) No. 260/2012 has already been undertaken. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 by introducing a grandfathering clause allowing banks and other payment service providers to continue also after 1 February 2014, for a limited period of time of 6 months, the processing of non-compliant payments through their legacy payments schemes alongside SCT and SDD. A clear communication of such amendment will provide certainty to the payment service users that their payments will continue to be processed after 1 February 2014, and it will allow those that have not yet migrated to do so as rapidly as possible. Under all circumstances, on-going information campaigns on the SEPA migration should continue. At the end of the grandfathering period, the Commission will not hesitate to take the necessary steps to ensure the full application of EU law by the Member States. In view of the above and given the very short period of time left before 1 February 2014, this Regulation should be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council as a matter of urgency and enter into force without delay. The proposal provides that the amendment applies as of 31 January 2014. This provision also allows for a retro-active application in case the proposal is not adopted by the European Parliament and the Council before 1 February but just after this date. This will avoid a legislative gap as of 1 February 2014 which would create legal uncertainty. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have a budgetary impact for the Commission."

BACKGROUND: phosphates are used in detergents to combat water hardness in order to allow efficient cleaning. Phosphates from detergents can contribute to certain adverse effects in the aquatic environment. The prime concern is that they can lead to an excess of nutrients which cause an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms, a phenomenon called eutrophication. Nevertheless, in view of concerns about eutrophication, the Commission presented the report in 2007 and concluded that the state of knowledge concerning the contribution of phosphates in detergents to eutrophication was still incomplete, but was developing rapidly. Further scientific work conducted thereafter, as well as information on economic and social impacts of possible restrictions, have been the basis for an impact assessment report, which analyses a number of policy options to address the use of phosphates in detergents IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the analysis of the impacts of the various policy options has been conducted taking into consideration results of the scientific analysis of the contribution of phosphates in detergents to eutrophication risks in the EU, as well as the criteria of effectiveness and efficiency (including practicality, socio-economic impacts, and monitorability). Five policy options have been scrutinised for their impact: Option 1: No action at EU level, leaving the responsibility to act to the Member States or in the context of regional cooperation (baseline option); Option 2: Voluntary action by industry; Option 3: Total ban of phosphates in detergents; Option 4: Restriction/limitation of phosphates content in laundry detergents; Option 5: Setting limits values for the content of phosphates in detergents. The evaluation and the impact analysis of the options shows that the introduction at European level of a limitation on the use of phosphates and other phosphorous compounds in household laundry detergents (option 4) will reduce the contribution of phosphates from detergents to eutrophication risks of EU waters and reduce the cost of phosphorous removal for waste water treatment plants. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to extend the scope of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 to allow introduction of a limitation on the content of phosphates and others phosphorous compounds in household laundry detergents, in order to decrease detergents' contribution to the overall eutrophication of EU surface waters, following the conclusions of the evaluations and the impact assessment performed by the Commission pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004. The draft Regulation, therefore, establishes an overall limit of 0.5 % by weight for the content of phosphorous in household laundry detergents, covering all phosphates and phosphorous containing compounds. For the time being, until technically and economically viable alternatives to phosphates become available for other types of detergent, the proposal limits the content of phosphates and other phosphorous compounds only in household laundry detergents. For household automatic dishwasher detergent containing phosphates, it is proposed that the Commission is tasked to review their contribution to the eutrophication risk within 5 years after the adoption of the proposed act, to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council (amendment of Article 16) and if deemed appropriate, to propose restrictions concerning their phosphates content by adapting the new Annex VIa to technical progress. The proposal also adapts the current provisions of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Finally, the proposed act maintains the already existing provision allowing Member States to lay down national rules to limit the content of phosphates and other phosphorous compounds in detergents other than household laundry detergents, if justified on environmental grounds.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) provides for a possibility for the Member States to grant decoupled aid under the Single Payment Scheme to vine-growers. Several Member States have used this possibility, which shows the utility of that measure. This amendment to the current Single CMO regulation provides for the definite transfer of the measure on support to vine-growers to the SPS. Member States must decide by 1 December 2012 with effect from 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: with 1.8% of EU GDP, down from 2.2% in 2009, infrastructure investment activities in the Union in 2016 were about 20% below investment rates before the global financial crisis. While investment conditions in Europe have improved thanks to structural reforms by Member States, a more favourable economic situation and public interventions, notably under the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI), investment gaps remain considerable in Europe. In order to meet the ambitious policy objectives of the Union, attracting private capital to finance investment remains essential while adjusting the approach towards more policy relevance. Building on lessons learnt from evaluations of predecessor financial instruments and of the EFSI, the Commission proposes to create the InvestEU programme for the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 in order to consolidate all EU budget financing in the form of loans and guarantees into a single framework. All evaluations found that the EU Guarantee proved relevant and enabled the EIB to undertake riskier activities and introduce higher risk products to support a wider range of beneficiaries. The EFSI also proved a relevant tool to mobilise private capital. The EFSI has mobilised EUR 207 billion of investment by end-2017. Mobilised investment from approved operations are expected to reach the EUR 315 billion target by mid-2018 or shortly thereafter. The new InvestEU programme shall have the capacity to shape an EU strategy to address the persistent investment gaps in the Union in sectors such as in new mobility models, renewable energies, energy efficiency, research and innovation, digitisation, education and skills, social economy and infrastructure, circular economy, natural capital, climate action or small and medium-sized businesses creation and growth. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the InvestEU Fund which shall support the policy objectives of the Union by mobilising public and private investment within the EU, hereby addressing market failures and investment gaps that hamper the achievement of EU goals regarding sustainability, competitiveness and inclusive growth. With the InvestEU programme, a single EU investment support instrument for internal action shall be created for the 2021-2027 MFF. InvestEU Fund : this fund consists of an EU budget guarantee that will back the financial products provided by the implementing partners. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 15.2 billion to the InvestEU Fund. The EU budget could thus provide a guarantee of EUR 38 billion to support projects of strategic importance across the EU. The financing and investment operations to be supported by the EU guarantee under the InvestEU Fund shall contribute to: the competitiveness of the Union, including innovation and digitisation; the sustainability of the Union economy and its growth; social resilience and inclusion; the integration of Union capital markets and the strengthening of the Single Market, including solutions addressing the fragmentation of the Union capital markets, diversifying sources of financing for Union enterprises and promoting sustainable finance. The InvestEU Fund has four policy windows: (i) sustainable infrastructure; (ii) research, innovation and digitisation; (iii) SMEs; (iv) social investment and skills. It is also foreseen that third countries could be associated to financial products under the policy windows of the InvestEU Fund by providing their full participation in cash. Member States wishing to use part of their funds under shared management through the InvestEU Fund may also contribute. These amounts come in addition to the EU guarantee of EUR 38 billion (in current prices). The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group should remain a privileged implementing partner under the InvestEU Fund's EU compartment. In addition, banks and other national and regional development institutions in Member States with specific experience and expertise may become financial partners, under certain conditions. Governance : the InvestEU Fund shall have an advisory board, which shall meet in two configurations: (i) representatives of implementing partners; and (ii) representatives of Member States. In particular, it shall advise the Commission on the design of financial products to be implemented under the InvestEU Fund, market failures and sub-optimal situations. It shall inform Member States about the implementation of the InvestEU Fund and allow regular exchanges of views on market developments and sharing of best practices. The proposal also introduces: the InvestEU advisory hub , which shall provide in particular technical assistance for project development; the InvestEU portal , which shall provide an easily accessible database to promote projects seeking funding. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary framework (commitments in current prices) foreseen for the InvestEU Programme is EUR 14.725 billion, including EUR 525 million for the InvestEU advisory platform, the InvestEU portal and accompanying measures. The overall provisioning will amount to EUR 15.2 billion, of which EUR 1 billion being covered by revenues, repayments and recoveries generated by existing financial instruments and the EFSI."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: under Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/2446, products obtained in Norway, Switzerland or Turkey incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there are to be considered as originating in a beneficiary country, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 45 of that Delegated Regulation (so-called 'cumulation' system). The cumulation system shall apply provided that Switzerland reciprocally grants the same treatment to products originating in the beneficiary countries which incorporate materials originating in the Union. In the case of Switzerland, the cumulation system was originally put in place by means of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Switzerland. That exchange of letters took place on 14 December 2000, following the approval of the Council by Decision 2001/101/EC. In order to ensure the application of a concept of origin corresponding to that set out in the rules of origin in the Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), Switzerland has amended its GSP rules of origin. Therefore, the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Switzerland must be revised. The rules of origin in the GSP were reformed in 2010. They provide for the implementation of a new system for the establishment of proofs of origin by registered exporters, which will apply from 1 January 2017. In order to anticipate the application of that new system and the rules, on 8 March 2012 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Switzerland, in the form of an exchange of letters, on the mutual acceptance of replacement certificates of origin Form A or replacement statements of origin. The negotiations resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Switzerland which should be approved. CONTENT: the draft decision seeks the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Switzerland on the cumulation of origin between the European Union, Switzerland, Norway and Turkey in the framework of the Generalised System of Preferences of the European Union. Under the agreement, certain products with content of Norwegian, Swiss or Turkish origin are to be treated on their arrival on the customs territory of the Union as products with content of Union origin."

An evaluation the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the existing set of Union social rules in road transport, identified certain deficiencies in the existing legal framework. Unclear and unsuitable rules on weekly rest, resting facilities, breaks in multi-manning and the absence of rules on the return of drivers to their home, lead to diverging interpretations and enforcement practices in the Member States. The objective of this proposal is to rectify the identified shortcomings and to help improve the working and business conditions in the sector in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a combination of two policy options: the first focused on strengthening enforcement, whilst the second established sector-specific criteria for posting workers in road transport and provides for specific enforcement measures. The impacts of the preferred option include improving the working and resting conditions of drivers (decrease in fatigue index by 28% and in periods away from home by 43% for EU-13 drivers and by 16% for EU-15 drivers). CONTENT: the proposal introduces a limited number of modifications to Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on driving time and Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on tachygraphs. Driving time : the main amendments proposed are as follows: private individuals using vehicles which would fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, to carry private belongings for their own purposes, are not obliged to record their driving times and rest periods and are therefore not obliged to have or use a tachograph or a driver's card; there is a uniform definition of the notion of 'non-commercial' carriage; drivers will have to record all tasks other than driving and also record any periods of availability; this will effectively monitor a driver's working patterns; drivers may arrange for their weekly rest periods in a more flexible manner over a period of four consecutive weeks, while ensuring that compensation for a reduced weekly rest is taken together with a regular weekly rest within three weeks. Any compensation for a reduced weekly rest must be attached to a regular weekly rest of at least 45 hours; a driver is not allowed to take a weekly rest of 45 hours or more in a vehicle. An employer is obliged to provide a driver with adequate accommodation with appropriate sleeping and hygiene facilities if drivers are not able to take a weekly rest at a private place of their choice; transport undertakings must organise the drivers' work in such a way that they are able to return to their home for a weekly rest at least once within three consecutive weeks; drivers may postpone the start of their weekly rest to reach their home provided that they comply with the daily and weekly driving time limits and with the required minimum duration of a weekly rest period; temporary exceptions from the general rules granted by Member States in urgent cases must be appropriately justified by the exceptional circumstances and the urgency involved in addressing them; Member States must inform the Commission about their national rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods applicable to the bus drivers exempted from the Regulation; national penalties imposed for infringing the Regulation should be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, as classified in relevant Union legislation. Tachygraph : the proposed amendments aim to improve the features of 'smart' tachographs to make it possible to more precisely position vehicles used for cross-border transport operations. The proposal adds an obligation on drivers to record in a tachograph the position of their vehicle after having crossed a border, at the earliest suitable stopping place."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty provides that the European Parliament and the Council are to establish the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency (Article 133 TFEU). Among these measures is the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. On the basis of this article, the protection of the euro as the single currency is the responsibility of the EU. Counterfeiting of the euro poses a true problem for the Union and for its institutions. Its threats are still substantial, as demonstrated by the increasing availability of high quality counterfeit euro's and security features on the internet/darknet and the existence of counterfeiting hotspots, e.g. in Colombia, Peru and China. Considering the cross-border circulation of the euro and the deep involvement of international organised crime in euro counterfeiting (production and distribution), it is necessary that national protection frameworks be complemented by an EU initiative to ensure homogeneous national and international cooperation, and to face possible emerging transnational risks. The current 2020 Pericles programme is specifically dedicated to the protection of euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting. In the mid-term evaluation of the programme, the Commission came to the conclusion that the continuation of the Pericles 2020 programme beyond 2020 should be supported, given its EU added value, its long-term impact and the sustainability of its actions. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Pericles IV programme, an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The proposed new programme aims to protect euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting and related fraud, by supporting and supplementing the measures undertaken by the Member States and; by assisting the competent national and Union authorities in their efforts to develop among themselves and with the Commission a close and regular cooperation and an exchange of best practice, where appropriate including third countries and international organisations. In particular, the programme shall take responsibility for tackling specific emerging threats (such as deep/dark web) and the relationship with certain countries (e.g. China), as it is difficult for individual Member States to effectively address these threats on their own. Implementation : the programme shall be implemented through direct management by the Commission. Financial support for eligible actions shall be granted under the programme in the form of grants or public contracts. Actions under the programme may be organised jointly by the Commission and other partners having relevant expertise, such as: the national central banks and the European Central Bank (ECB); the National Analysis Centres (NACs) and the Coin National Analysis Centres; the European Technical and Scientific Centre and the mints; Europol, Eurojust and Interpol. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 7.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount is in line with the Commission proposal for the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027."
3308EP7,"""""Extending the period of application of Council Decision 2003/17/EC, and updating the names of a third country and the authorities responsible for production approval and control""""",0.702,0.791,0.667,0.516,0.364,0.783,0.749,0.714,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Decision 2003/17/EC by extending its period of application and by updating the name of a third country and of the authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directives on the marketing of fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of oil and fibre plants regulate the internal marketing of seed for sowing of the plant species as listed by those Directives. To facilitate trades and to respond promptly to the marketing request, those Directives provide for the Council to establish rules for authorising the importation of seed under an equivalence system from third countries. Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that for a limited period, field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops of certain species are considered as equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union legislation and that seed of certain species produced in third countries is considered as equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union legislation. It appears that those field inspections continue to afford the same guarantees as those carried out by the Member States. Those field inspections should therefore continue to be considered as equivalent. As Decision 2003/17/EC will expire on 31 December 2012, the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision should be extended. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provided the list of countries to be recognised for the application of the equivalence principle for importation, detailed requirements to be fulfilled, and in particular limited to five years the period for which equivalence recognition is to be extended if all the relevant requirements are fulfilled. That period will expire on 31 December 2012. Currently, the temporary extension is envisaged for only 5 years. However, the revision of the new Regulation on seeds and reproductive materials (under co- decision procedures) will be launched in September 2012, with specific implementing measures to be adopted thereafter. In order to ensure the necessary supply of seed to the EU market, the Commission proposes to extend these rules by ten years, until 31 December 2022. The proposal also aims to delete the reference to Yugoslavia in Decision 2003/17/EC. Serbia, as a member of the OECD Scheme for the Varietal Certification of Seed moving in International Trades and member of the International Seed Testing Association as regards the seed sampling and testing, will be added to the list of third countries in Annex I to Decision 2003/17/EC. Lastly, the proposal updates the names of some authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
5896EP7,"""""Conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals""""",0.105,0.875,0.93,0.161,0.212,0.855,0.897,0.629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of research, studies, pupil exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directives 2005/71/EC and 2004/114/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union’s working age population has practically stopped growing and over the next couple of years it will start shrinking. The EU is also facing a situation of 'innovation emergency'. Europe is spending 0.8% of GDP less than the US and 1.5% less than Japan every year on Research & Development (R&D). in addition, thousands of the best researchers and innovators have moved to countries where conditions are more favorable. To counterbalance this lack of manpower, immigration from outside the EU is one source of highly skilled people, and third-country national students and researchers in particular are groups which are increasingly sought after and which the EU needs to actively attract. Allowing third-country nationals to acquire skills and knowledge through a period of training in Europe encourages “brain circulation” and supports cooperation with third countries. However, in the absence of a clear legal framework, there is also a risk of exploitation to which trainees and au-pairs are particularly exposed, with the subsequent risk of unfair competition on the labour market. With a view to better optimising those benefits and properly tackling those risks, and taking account of the similarities of the challenges faced by these categories of migrants, this proposal amends Council Directive 2004/114/EC (“Students’ Directive”) on the conditions of admission of third country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service: extending its scope to remunerated trainees and au-pairs and making mandatory provisions on unremunerated trainees that are currently discretionary, as well as Council Directive 2005/71/EC on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research (“Researchers’ Directive”). The proposal seeks to remedy the shortcomings highlighted in the implementation reports of the two Directives [see COM(2011)901 and 587] on the conditions of admissions in particular (visas, mobility aspects…) and procedural safeguards. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the following options were considered: Option 1 (baseline): the Member States would continue to apply different and diverging rules with respect to admission conditions (e.g. the granting of visas); Option 2: Increased communication efforts (in particular in case of researchers), and strengthened enforcement of the current rules; Option 3: Improvement of admission conditions, rights and procedural guarantees whereby Member States would be obliged to (i) grant the requisite visas to the third-country national (students and other categories) who has submitted an application and (ii) introduce a compulsory deadline for decisions on an application (60 days); (iii) provide for the right of students to work during their period of study for a minimum of 15 hours per week; Option 4: Further improvement of admission conditions, rights also on intra-EU mobility and procedural guarantees: (i) access to job-seeking following completion of studies or research project; (ii) extended scope to au-pairs and remunerated trainees; (iii) possibility to issue long-stay visas or residence permits; (iv) increased intra-EU mobility for researchers, students and remunerated trainees; (v) specific, more favorable rules applicable to beneficiaries of EU programmes (e.g. Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie); (vi) right of students to work for a minimum of 20 hours per week as of the first year of residence ; (vii) after finalization of their studies/research, students and researchers would be allowed to stay on the territory to identify work opportunities for a period of 12 months; (viii) decisions on applications within 60 days (all groups), and within 30 days for Erasmus Mundus and Marie Curie fellows. Option 4 appears to be the most cost-effective option to meet the key objectives and brings about positive economic and social impacts. The main disadvantage of legislative changes would be the costs involved: Member States would have to make modifications to their legislative frameworks. LEGAL BASIS: Article 79(2) points (a) and (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal’s overall objective is to support social, cultural and economic relationships between the EU and third countries, foster the transfer of skills and know-how and promote competitiveness while, at the same time, provide for safeguards ensuring fair treatment of these groups of third-country nationals. Chapter I – General provisions: the proposal has two specific objectives: to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals to the territory of the Member States for a period exceeding three months for the purposes of research, studies, pupil exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing; to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country national students and remunerated trainees in Member States other than the Member State which first grants the third-country national an authorisation. Scope: the proposal extends the scope of the “Student” Directive to include remunerated trainees and au-pairs. The proposal would not, however, apply to third-country nationals who are EU long-term residents given their more privileged status and their specific type of residence permit, or refugees, those residing in a Member State on a strictly temporary basis in accordance with Union legislation. Member States may grant more favourable conditions for the persons to whom the proposal for Directive applies, however only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern family members of researchers, rights to equal treatment, economic activities and procedural safeguards. Chapter II – Admission: General principle: an applicant who satisfies all the general and specific conditions for admission shall be granted a residence permit or a long-stay visa by the Member State where the application has been made. The proposal lays down the general conditions that applicants must fulfil in order to be admitted to a Member State, besides the specific conditions that apply to the different categories of third-country nationals laid down in the proposal. The general conditions are very much in line with those developed in the existing acquis on legal migration, and include valid documents, sickness insurance and minimum resources. Specific conditions: - the specific conditions of admission for researchers which already exist in the Researchers' Directive are maintained. The proposal lists the elements that should be contained in the hosting agreement: title and purpose of the research project, the confirmation of the organisation that it is hosting the researcher so that he or she can complete the research project, the start and end date of the research project, etc. For researchers to be aware of research organisations that can enter into hosting agreements, emphasis is placed in the proposal on the need for the list of approved organisation to be publicly available and up-dated regularly; - for students, the specific conditions are those in the “Students’ Directive”; - for pupils, remunerated and unremunerated trainees, volunteers and au-pairs, the specific conditions are that these persons are required to show evidence of the organisation that is responsible for their exchange, training or, volunteering. for au-pairs: in addition, there needs to be evidence that the host family accepts responsibility for example as far as subsistence and accommodation are concerned. The au-pair stay also needs to be based on an agreement between the au-pair and the host family defining his/her rights and obligations; for remunerated trainees, the training programme, its duration, conditions of supervision and working conditions need to be specified. In order to avoid situations in which trainees are used as 'cheap labour', the host entity may be obliged to declare that the third-country national is not filling a job. Chapter III – Authorisations and duration of residence: a series of provisions set out the information that should be included on the third-country national's residence permit or long-term visa. For researchers and students an authorisation should be granted for at least one year. For all other groups, the authorisation is limited to one year as a rule, with the possibility for exceptions. Chapter IV – Grounds for refusal, withdrawal or non-renewal of authorisations: the provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusing, withdrawing or not renewing an authorisation, such as the general and specific conditions for admission no longer being met, false documents etc., which are standard conditions under the existing migration Directives. Chapter V – Rights: to ensure the fair treatment of third-country nationals falling under the scope of the Directive, a new provision entitles them to equal treatment under the Single Permit Directive. More favourable rights to equal treatment with nationals of the host Member State as regards branches of social security as defined in Regulation No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security schemes are maintained for third-country national researchers, without the possibility for the limitations laid down by the Single Permit Directive. Furthermore, school pupils, volunteers, unremunerated trainees and au-pairs will benefit from equal treatment rights with nationals of the host Member State as regards access to goods and services and the supply of goods and services made available to the public independently on whether Union or national law gives them access to the labour market. Right to work: provisions exist in the proposal whereby researchers and students are given the right to work , with Member States being able to set certain limits. Researchers, as was the case under Directive 2005/71, are allowed to teach in accordance with national legislation. Regarding students, whereas under Directive 2004/114/EC students were allowed to work for a minimum of 10 hours per week, this period has been increased to 20 hours. With respect to students' access to economic activities, Member States may continue take into consideration their labour market situation but this should be done in a proportionate way in order not to systematically endanger the right to work. The proposal introduces the possibility for students and researchers, if they fulfil the general admission conditions of the proposal (except for the condition on being a minor), to stay in the Member State for 12 months upon finalisation of their studies/research in order to look for work or set up a business. This provision has the potential to make the Member States more competitive in the search for talents on a global stage. It would however not be an automatic work permit. In a period of more than 3 and less than 6 months, Member States could ask the third-country nationals to provide documentation that they are genuinely seeking for a job (for example, copies of the letters and CVs sent to employers) or are in the process of setting up a business. After 6 months, they could also ask third- country nationals to provide evidence that they have a genuine chance of being engaged or of launching a business. The proposal includes specific provisions on the admission and access to the labour market of researchers' family members in derogation to Directive 2003/86/EC with a view to increasing the EU’s attractiveness to third-country national researchers. Chapter VI – Mobility between Member States: a series of articles set out the conditions under which researchers, students and trainees can move between the Member States, in order to facilitate such mobility: for researchers , under Directive 2005/71/EC, the period for which they are allowed to move to a second Member State on the basis of the hosting agreement concluded in the first Member State has been extended from 3 to 6 months (N.B. in line with the provisions of the Blue Card Directive, researchers' family members can move between Member States together with the researcher). for students , provisions would also allow them to move to a second Member State for a period of up to 6 months on the basis of the authorisation granted by the first Member State . Specific rules apply to third country nationals who come under EU mobility programmes, for example the current Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie programmes, in order to simplify the exercise of mobility. Chapter VII – Procedure and transparency: the proposal introduces a time-limit that obliges Member States to decide on the complete application for an authorisation and notify the applicant in writing within 60 days (applying for all groups), and within 30 days for Union programmes including mobility measures. Procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decisions in writing, and ensuring respect for the right to a legal remedy. Provisions are also included in regard to communication: the Member States would be required to make information available on the entry and residence conditions as set by this proposal, including on approved research organisations and on fees. Taxes and fees: Member States may charge fees for the processing of applications. However, the amount of such fees should not endanger the fulfilment of the Directive's objectives. Chapter VIII - Final provisions: Member States would be required to establish national contact points to exchange information on third-country nationals covered by the proposal who move between Member States. Such national contact points already exist in relation to certain existing migration Directives such as the Blue Card Directive. Member States would be required to communicate to the Commission statistics on the numbers of third-country nationals granted authorisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the decline in passenger demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, air carriers have made major changes to their schedules since 1 March 2020, which have resulted in a slot utilisation rate at coordinated airports falling far below the 80% threshold imposed by the Slot Regulation. This situation is likely to continue to negatively impact air carriers up to and including winter 2024/2025. For the period starting after more than a year of waiving the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule (from 1 February 2020 to 27 March 2021), which preserves air carriers’ 2019 grandfathered slots until the end of the winter 2021/2022 scheduling season, the Commission proposes to establish a pathway to return to a normal application of the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule. The return to normal should not be sudden to avoid destabilising the aviation market to the detriment of air carriers, connectivity, EU consumers, and the environment. It should take place in line with future increases in traffic levels toward 2019 levels or by a stabilisation of air traffic to a new market situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that from the start of the summer 2021 scheduling period, the normal application of the slot utilisation requirements of the Slot Regulation should reapply, but that the rate should be set at 40/60 % instead of 80/20 %. Relief should be targeted at air carriers whose intention is to operate their grandfathered slots as soon as demand sufficiently recovers and flights are once again economically viable. Consequently, slot series newly allocated to an air carrier for the first time would not be covered by the planned relief. The proposal foresees a deadline for air carriers to return unwanted slots to the coordinator if they want to benefit from the relief. A deadline of three weeks before the planned operational date for that slot would give airports and other airport service providers visibility on the required capacity and the volume of operations that they are expected to make available adequate infrastructure, facilities and staff. The proposal also clarifies under what circumstances coordinators could withdraw slots from air carriers. The Commission could adopt delegated acts to further extend the period during which the relief applies if the COVID-19 pandemic is not resolved and continues to have a negative impact on the air transport sector, including on historical grandfather rights."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 779/98 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 779/98 of 7 April 1998 on the import into the Community of agricultural products originating in Turkey, repealing Regulation (EEC) No 4115/86 and amending Regulation (EC) No 3010/95. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main provisions codified : Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council establishes the system of preferences applicable to imports into the Union of agricultural products originating in Turkey. The proposed Regulation sets out uniform conditions for the implementation of this system. Implementing powers are conferred on the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (examination procedure). In the case of products for which Union regulations require a certain import price to be observed, the application of the preferential tariff system shall be subject to the observance of that price. The same goes for certain fishery products. It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 779/98."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), to which the Union has been a contracting party since 2006, is the regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of resources of tuna and tuna-like species in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, established by the Convention for the Strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission established by the 1949 Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica (the IATTC Convention). The IATTC is empowered to adopt decisions (resolutions) to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the IATTC Convention Area. IATTC resolutions are binding on the Contracting Parties. They also impose obligations on private operators (e.g. vessel masters). The EU has an average of three purse-seiners and thirty-some longliners operating in the IATTC Convention area. The main stocks targeted by the EU fleet are tropical tunas and swordfish. The provisions of some IATTC Resolutions were last transposed through Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 of 7 May 2007 laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species. The proposal aims to take into account changes that have occurred since the adoption of that Regulation but which have not yet been covered by EU law. CONTENT: the proposal for amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 lays down management, conservation and control measures relating to fishing in the IATTC Convention Area and for stocks of tuna and tuna-like species, other species of fish caught by vessels fishing for tuna and tuna-like species and species belonging to the same ecosystem. The Regulation shall apply to EU vessels fishing in the IATTC Convention area. The proposed Regulation: - deals with conservation and management measures, including provisions relevant to purse-seine vessels fishing for tropical tuna, prohibition of fishing on data buoys, provisions concerning fishing in the vicinity of Fish Aggregating Devices, their deployment, design and set of rules for transhipment in port; - sets out measures designed to protect certain marine species present in the area covered by the IATTC Convention, such as oceanic white-tip, silky, and hammerhead sharks and mobulid rays. These measures include data provision and release duties, as well as measures related to the protection of sea turtles and seabirds; - contains provisions for the IATTC observer scheme; - sets vessel requirements, including those related to the IATTC Regional Vessel Register, to reporting duties and to the protocol for the sealing of wells; - contains information on the reporting duties related to the data statistical programme, and requirements for the bigeye tuna document programme; - provides for delegated powers granted to the Commission to cater for amendments to measures, which are expected to be frequent and to make sure that Union fishing vessels are put on equal footing with vessels of other Contracting Parties to the IATTC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 493(1) and 498(1) of Regulation (EU) nº 575/2013 (‘CRR’) exempt commodity dealers from large exposures requirements and from own funds requirements respectively. Both exemptions expire on 31 December 2017. This 'sunset clause' was originally included in the CRR in order to allow time for regulators to determine a prudential regulation adapted to the risk profile of commodity dealers. To this end, the CRR mandates the Commission to prepare reports by the end of 2015. On the basis of those reports, the Commission may decide to submit proposals to amend the CRR. The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) laid down in the CRR and Directive 2013/36/EC (‘the Capital Requirements Directive’) is currently under review. The results will determine the appropriate prudential treatment of commodity dealers. The investment firms review is a complex project. The finalisation of the review and the adoption of new legislation that may be required in light of that review will be concluded only after 31 December 2017. It is therefore highly improbable that any legislation that may result from this review can be prepared, adopted and applied before the current exemptions expire. This has implications for commodity dealers: if no specific prudential framework that may result from the investment firm review would be in place by then, they would be subject to the full CRR/CRD requirements starting from 1 January 2018. This could force them to significantly increase the amount of own funds that they need to have in order to continue their activities and could therefore increase the related costs of performing those activities. To prevent this situation arising, the Commission feels it opportune to extend the existing exemptions laid down in the CRR, while taking into account the amount of time that will be necessary to conclude the investment firms review and to prepare, adopt and apply any legislation that may result from that review.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down common rules for the basic payment scheme and related payments. It seeks to better target support to certain actions, areas or beneficiaries as well as to pave the way for convergence of the level of support within and across Member States. The regulation also includes a section on coupled support. (1) A single scheme across the EU, the basic payment scheme, replaces the Single Payment Scheme and the Single Area Payment Scheme as from 2014. The scheme will operate on the basis of payment entitlements allocated at national or regional level to all farmers according to their eligible hectares in the first year of application. (2) The definition of active farmer further enhances targeting on farmers genuinely engaged in agricultural activities, and thus legitimizes support. In addition, the progressive reduction and capping of support for large beneficiaries is foreseen while taking due account of employment. (3) The following payments are also provided: · a payment (30% of annual national ceiling) for farmers following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment: crop diversification, maintenance of permanent pastures and ecological focus areas. Organic farming automatically benefits from this payment, while farmers in Natura 2000 areas will have to comply with the relevant requirements to the extent that they are consistent with the Natura 2000 legislation; · a voluntary payment (up to 5% of annual national ceiling) for farmers in areas facing specific natural constraints (areas delimited in the same manner as for rural development purposes); this payment recognizes the need for income support to maintain presence in areas facing specific natural constraints and complements existing support under rural development; · a payment (up to 2% of annual national ceiling) for young farmers in their installation, which may be complemented by setting up aid under rural development. At the same time, the Regulation: lays down a simplified scheme for small farmers (up to 10% of annual national ceiling), who may thus receive a lump sum payment replacing all direct payments and producing administrative simplification with an easing of such farmers' obligations related to greening, cross compliance and controls; provides a voluntary coupled support scheme for specific types of farming or specific agricultural systems which are experiencing certain difficulties and which are particularly important for economic and/or social reasons; support is provided to the extent necessary to maintain current levels of production (up to 5% of annual national ceiling with the possibility to go beyond this in particular cases); maintain the possibility for Complementary National Direct Payments for Bulgaria and Romania and includes a specific payment for cotton. In terms of simplification, the new direct payments system will be based on a single type of payment entitlements and streamline transfer rules, thereby simplifying its management. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits for gaseous and particulate pollutants and EU type-approval procedures for various categories of engines for non-road mobile machinery. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Regulation (EU) 2020/1040 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 was adopted. The aim of this Regulation was to postpone certain deadlines that manufacturers could no longer meet without sustaining serious economic damage due to the unexpected disruptions in the supply chain. This concerned machinery that use so-called ‘transition engines’ in the power range <56kW and >130kW, and whose production had to be completed by 30 June 2020 and placing on the market by 31 December 2020. Under the amended Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, manufacturers were provided with an additional 12 months to produce and place on the market the machinery fitted with those engines. However, due to the continued supply chain and production disruptions caused by the COVID-19 second and third waves, manufacturers will not be able to meet the 2021 deadlines applicable to the machinery fitted with transition engines in the power range between 56kW and 130kW, and above 300kW without sustaining serious economic damage. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to postpone the deadlines to avoid that transition engines can no longer be fitted in the machinery in time and are then scrapped. CONTENT: in view of the current situation and to ensure legal certainty and to avoid possible market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for the construction and placing on the market of machinery equipped with certain transition engines. The extension of the relevant periods should be 6 months for the production of machinery equipped with these engines and 9 months for the placing on the market."
934EP7,"""""Macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board""""",0.667,0.89,0.86,0.323,0.333,0.867,0.836,0.029,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European Systemic Risk Board. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. A high level group of experts, chaired by Mr. Jacques de Larosière, was established to make recommendations with a view to establishing a more efficient, integrated and sustainable supervisory framework. The key recommendations of the de Larosière group focus on establishing: a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that would be responsible for macro-prudential oversight of the financial system within the Community in order to prevent or mitigate systemic risks, to avoid episodes of widespread financial distress, contribute to a smooth functioning of the Internal Market and ensure a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth; a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by the transformation of existing European supervisory committees in a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). On 27 May 2009, the Commission published a Communication on Financial Supervision in the EU, describing in detail how these recommendations could be put into effect, focusing in particular on the establishment of the proposed ESFS and ESRB. The Commission notes that stakeholders, e.g. financial institutions, investors and consumers, can only have sufficient confidence in cross-border financial activities with arrangements in place that properly acknowledge the interdependence between micro and macro-prudential risks. Too often in the past, the focus of prudential supervision has been exclusively at the micro-level, with supervisors assessing the balance sheets of individual financial institutions without due consideration for interactions between institutions and between institutions and the broader financial system. Providing this broader perspective is the responsibility of macro-prudential supervisors. These supervisors shall assess potential financial-stability risks arising from developments that can impact on a sectoral level or at the level of the financial system as a whole. By addressing such risks, the ESRB would be an essential building block for an integrated EU supervisory structure necessary to promote timely and consistent policy responses among Member States, thus preventing diverging approaches and so improve the functioning of the Internal Market. The Regulation establishing the ESRB is completed by a Council decision which confers on the European Central Bank (ECB) the task of ensuring the Secretariat of the ESRB. Accordingly, the ECB will provide the administrative, logistical, statistical and analytical support to the ESRB. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May 2009 Communication was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment has nevertheless been made in respect of the more detailed aspects of the proposal (please see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: the ESRB is an entirely new European body with no precedent, which shall be responsible for macro-prudential oversight. Tasks and powers of the ESRB : the ESRB will not have any binding powers to impose measures on Member States or national authorities. It has been conceived as a body with a high level composition that should influence the actions of policy makers and supervisors by means of its moral authority. To this end, it will not only provide high quality assessment of the macro-prudential situation but it may also issue risk warnings and recommendations which identify the potential unbalances in the financial system which are likely to increase systemic risks and the appropriate remedial actions. The ESRB will have a broad scope of activity, not limited to a specific type of entity or market. Warnings and recommendations may address any aspect of the financial system which may generate a systemic risk. It will also cooperate with the relevant international financial institutions (IMF, FSB) and third countries on issues related to macro-prudential oversight. Warnings and recommendations : an essential role of the ESRB is to identify risks with a systemic dimension and prevent or mitigate their impact on the financial system within the EU. To this end, the ESRB may issue risk warnings. These warnings should prompt early responses to avoid the build-up of wider problems and eventually a future crisis. If necessary, the ESRB may also recommend specific actions to address any identified risks. ESRB recommendations will not be legally binding. However, the addressees of recommendations cannot remain passive towards a risk which has been identified and are expected to react in some way. If the addressee agrees with a recommendation, it must communicate all the actions undertaken to follow what is prescribed in the recommendation. If the addressee does not agree with a recommendation and chooses not to act, the reasons for inaction must be properly explained. Hence, recommendations issued by the ESRB cannot be simply ignored. The ESRB shall decide on a case by case basis whether warnings and recommendations should be made public. On the one hand, the publication of a recommendation may increase the pressure for prompt corrective actions. On the other hand, it could trigger adverse financial-market reactions. Sensitivity of judgement will be required in each case. Moreover, it seems appropriate that warnings and recommendations should not be made public unless a qualified majority of two-thirds of the General Board decides otherwise. The addressees of warnings and recommendations can be the Community as a whole, one or more Member States, one or more European Supervisory Authorities, and one or more national supervisory authorities. All warnings and recommendations must be transmitted to the Council, while those related to supervisory issues should also be transmitted to the relevant ESA. This transmission to the Council and to the ESAs is not intended as a way to water down their content, but aims on the contrary at increasing the moral pressure on the addressee to act or explain and offering the possibility to the Council to comment it. Access to information : the interconnectedness of financial institutions and markets implies that the monitoring and assessment of potential systemic risks should be based on a broad set of relevant macro-economic and micro-financial data and indicators. The ESRB should therefore have access to all the information necessary to perform its duties while preserving the confidentiality of these data. It will be able to rely on the broad set of data already collected through the Eurosystem by the ECB on Monetary and Financial Institutions. To ensure the necessary consistency between the micro-supervisors and the ESRB, the ESRB, through its secretariat, will also be able to request the ESAs to provide information in summary or collective form. Should this information be not available (or not made available), the ESRB will be able to request data directly from national supervisory authorities, national central banks (NCBs) or other authorities of Member States. The regulation furthermore creates a general obligation on the ESAs, the NCBs and Member States to provide to the ESRB all the information needed for the fulfilment of its tasks, thus guaranteeing a wide access to the data needed for the macro-prudential analysis. As some individual institutions can be systemic in nature (because of their size, their interconnectedness with other financial institutions or their risk profile), the ESRB – through its secretariat - shall also have access to individual data upon a reasoned request to the ESAs. Relationship with the ESFS : the proposed framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate efficiently. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB will need a timely flow of harmonised micro-level data, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities will benefit from the ESRB’s insights into the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more competent national supervisory authorities. Confidentiality: the Members of the General Board of the ESRB and the staff working for the ESRB shall be subject to the obligation of professional secrecy. The addressees, the Council and the ESAs shall also take the measures necessary for the protection of the confidential nature of the warnings and recommendations. The internal organisation of the ESRB : the ESRB shall be composed of: (i) a General Board; (ii) a Steering Committee and (iii) a Secretariat. The General Board is the decision making body of the ESRB and as such, will be responsible for the adoption of the warnings and recommendations. The composition of the General Board is a key issue for the effectiveness of the ESRB. The members of the General Board with voting rights are the Governors of national central banks; the President and the vice-President of the ECB; a Member of the European Commission; and the Chairpersons of the three European Supervisory Authorities. The members of the General Board without voting rights are: - one high level representative per Member State of the competent national supervisory authorities, and the President of the Economic and Financial Committee. The proposal describes in detail the role of the Chairperson, the steering committee and the secretariat as well as the Advisory Technical Committee and other sources of advice. Reporting obligations : the ESRB shall be accountable to the European Parliament and to the Council and shall therefore report to them at least annually. The European Parliament and the Council may also require the ESRB to report more often. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary cost related to the ESRB will be borne by the ECB and will not have any direct implication for the Community budget. The cost of such support will depend on the extent to which the existing staff and resources of the ECB can be used to fulfil the tasks of the Secretariat of the ESRB."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 introduced a general ban on placing seal products on the Union's market (Basic Regulation). Those measures were adopted in response to public moral concerns about the animal welfare aspects of the killing of seals. At the same time, seal hunting is an integral part of the culture and identity of the Inuit and other indigenous communities and makes a major contribution to their subsistence. It is for this reason that the Basic Regulation contains: an exception from the general ban for seal products derived from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities that contribute to their subsistence (""the IC exception""); exceptions for the import of seal products derived from seals hunted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine resources on a not-for profit basis and not for commercial reasons (""the MRM exception"") as well as for imports of an occasional nature and which consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families. An implementing Regulation, Commission Regulation (EU) No 737/2010 lays down detailed rules for the implementation of the Basic Regulation. Both acts were challenged by Canada and Norway in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In June 2014, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the reports disapproving the IC and MRM exceptions. · The MRM exception was found not to be justified as the possible difference in the commercial dimension of commercial hunts and MRM hunts (small scale, non-profit) was not sufficient to justify the distinction. · With regard to the IC exception, while in principle reflecting a legitimate distinction, the Appellate body ruled, that some elements of its design and application amounted to “arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination”. The purpose of this proposal is to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings with regard to the Basic Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products states that the placing on the market of seal products shall be allowed only where the seal products result from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities, provided that the following conditions are all satisfied: the hunt has been traditionally conducted by the community; the hunt contributes to the subsistence of the community and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons; the hunt is conducted in a manner which reduces pain, distress, fear or other forms of suffering of the animals hunted to the extent possible taking into consideration the traditional way of life and the subsistence needs of the community. As regards the import of seal products , this shall also be allowed where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families. The nature and quantity of such goods shall not be such as to indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the deepening of the financial crisis in some of the Member States is affecting substantially the real economy due to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by Governments to borrow money from the market. In this context, the proper implementation of cohesion programmes is of particular importance because it facilitates financial assistance to the real economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the euro countries or from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non euro countries. To date, six countries have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme: Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. These Member States (and indeed any other Member State which may be concerned in the future by such assistance programmes) should receive help to continue the implementation of the Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund programmes by increasing the sums allocated to the countries concerned for the period for which they are under the support mechanisms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to increase payments to the countries concerned, for the period they are under the support mechanisms. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal contains provisions that would allow the Commission to increase payments to the countries most affected by the financial crisis for the period for which they are under the support mechanisms, without changing their overall allocation under the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2007-2013. It is proposed to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund so as to enable the Commission, upon the request of the Member States concerned, to reimburse the newly declared expenditure for the period in question by an increased amount calculated by applying a 10 percentage points top-up of the applicable co-financing rates for the priority axis. In applying the top-up, the co-financing rate of the programme cannot exceed by more than 10 percentage points the maximum ceilings of Annex III to the General Regulation. In any case contribution from the funds to the priority axis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned in the Commission decision approving the operational programme. This will be a temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits the support mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPACT: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. For payment appropriations, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal will imply an increase of payment appropriations (for 2012 approximately EUR 2,304 million) which may be compensated by the end of the programming period. Therefore, the total payment appropriations for the whole programming period remain unchanged. The Commission will in 2012 review the need for additional payment credits and, if necessary, propose the necessary actions to the Budgetary Authority"

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) lays down rules for investment firms operating in EU financial markets. These rules determine how investment firms should interact with investors and how they should organise the trading venues. The rules on investment services have an important role to play in promoting the recapitalisation of European firms in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, formal burdens that are not strictly necessary should be removed. The Commission therefore strives to recalibrate investor protection requirements to strike the right balance between a sufficient level of transparency for the client, the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for firms. This legislative proposal amending MiFID II is part of a set of measures to facilitate the economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, which includes also legislative proposals amending the Prospectus Regulation the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, for a streamlined application of the regulatory requirements, keeping high safeguards for retail clients while allowing for more flexibility for wholesale clients and ensures that fully functioning commodity markets can play their important role in the recovery of EU economies. This legislative proposal also aims to complement the objectives of the Capital Markets Union to diversify market-based sources of financing for European companies and facilitate cross-border investments. Amendments to information requirements The changes to the current regime provide a precise calibration of the rules applicable to retail clients, professional customers and eligible counterparties. The majority of the proposed changes shall consist of relief for professional clients and eligible counterparties, namely: - the phasing out of paper-based default method: documents shall be provided in electronic format. However, retail clients may opt-in to paper based information; - as regards the indication of costs and charges, the introduction of an exemption for eligible counterparties and professional clients for services other than investment advice and portfolio management. In addition, in case of distance communication all clients using all services shall be able, under certain conditions, to receive costs and charges information just after the transaction; - lighter ex-post reporting obligations: these reports shall no longer apply in respect of eligible counterparties; professional clients shall be able to choose whether or not to receive them; - the temporary suspension of best execution reporting; - the waiver by professional investors of cost-benefit analysis in the event of a change of product during the course of the relationship; - the lifting of the product governance requirements for simple corporate bonds with make-whole clauses (which are investor-protective features). The aim of this exemption is to make more plain vanilla corporate bonds available to retail investors. Measures affecting energy derivatives markets The proposal introduces changes to the regime applicable to commodities with a view to enabling businesses in the real economy to cope with market volatility, while at the same time allowing the emergence of new commodity contracts, which is also important for promoting the international role of the euro. The proposed amendments recalibrate precisely the position limit regime and the scope of the hedging exemption. They shall not concern agricultural commodities, in particular products for human consumption."

The Commission has expanded on this in its Communication “on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes”. The Council endorsed this approach in conclusions on 5 March 2007. The Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. To date, Protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. In December 2013, Tunisia expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the Protocol negotiated with Tunisia is attached and the subject of this proposal. It is now appropriate for the European Union to conclude the protocol. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and Article 218(7) thereof. CONTENT: this is a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol. This Protocol contains a Framework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Tunisia in Union programmes. It contains standard conditions that should be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with whom such protocols are to be concluded. Objectives: the protocol seeks to define the financial and technical rules permitting Tunisia to participate in certain EU programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol sets out principles for economic, financial and technical cooperation measure and allows Tunisia to receive technical assistance, in particular financial assistance, from the European Union pursuant to the European Union programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. Space supports many policies and strategic priorities of the Union. It can play a crucial role in effectively tackling new challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, border control, maritime surveillance and security of Union citizens. The Union’s space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. It is therefore crucial that the Union remains a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, that it encourages scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission stressed in the space strategy for Europe, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of the services offered by Galileo and EGNOS (the global and regional satellite navigation systems) and Copernicus (Union Earth observation and monitoring programme) and of preparing new generations of these services, enhancing the space surveillance and tracking (SST) services and announced the governmental satellite communications initiative ‘GOVSATCOM’. The Commission's approach was advocated both by the Council in its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2017 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 12 September 2017. The development and implementation of a space programme is beyond the financial and technical capabilities of a single Member State and can only be achieved at EU level. By providing a coherent framework for future investment, a fully integrated space programme shall bring together all the Union's activities in this highly strategic field. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027. It aims to consolidate all existing and new space activities in a single programme. The general objectives of the proposed new programme are as follows: provide high-quality, up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space data, information and services, where possible on a global scale, meeting existing and future needs and able to meet the Union's political priorities, including climate change and security and defence; maximise socio-economic benefits, including by promoting the widest possible use of data, information and services provided by programme components; strengthen the security of the Union and its Member States, its freedom of action and its strategic autonomy; promote the Union’s role on the international stage as a leading actor in the space sector. The programme shall have the following specific objectives: Galileo and EGNOS : to provide of state-of-the-art and, where appropriate, secure positioning, navigation and timing services. The programme shall continue to invest in operations and infrastructure to complement and maintain the satellite constellation, improve signal precision to provide positioning information for autonomous and connected vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors, and encourage the market introduction of satellite navigation services; Copernicus : to deliver accurate and reliable Earth Observation data and information, supplied on a long-term basis, to support the implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States' policies in the fields of the environment, climate change, agriculture and rural development, civil protection, safety and security, as well as the digital economy; Space Situational Awareness (SSA) : to enhance SST capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects which helps avoid collisions in space and monitors the re-entry of space objects to Earth, to monitor space weather and to map and network Member States near Earth object capacities; GOVSATCOM : to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services, to enhance the operational effectiveness of security actors and safeguard citizens' rights to security, to diplomatic or consular protection, and to protection of personal data. The programme shall also: (i) contribute, where this is required for the needs of the Programme, to an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space; (ii) support and reinforce the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity to innovate of legal and natural persons from the Union active or wishing to become active in that sector, with particular regard to the position and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Governance : the proposal clarifies the relations between the various players involved and the role of these players, mainly the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Agency for Space, and by establishing a unified system of governance for all the components of this programme. It enhances the role of the former European GNSS Agency by expanding the scope of its tasks as regards security accreditation to include all the components of the Programme, thus justifying a change of name for this agency, which is to become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. Lastly, it specifies and standardises the security framework for the Programme, particularly as regards the principles to be respected, procedures to be followed and measures to be taken, which is of crucial importance, given the dual use nature of the actions. The programme shares similar objectives with other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe, InvestEU Fund, European Defence Fund and Funds under Regulation (EU) on the common provisions Regulation. Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be foreseen. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 16 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, with the following indicative breakdown: for Galileo and EGNOS : EUR 9.7 billion; for Copernicus : EUR 5.8 billion; for SSA/Govsatcom : EUR 0.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant drop in demand which in turn has led to a sharp drop in rail transport. Demand for both passenger and freight services for the whole of 2020 is expected to be well below 2019 levels. The pandemic may lead to a large number of insolvencies and liquidity shortages within the railway sector. It affects all the supply chain and has effects on railway undertakings, shippers and logistic enterprises. Infrastructure managers and service facility operators will also suffer from its financial consequences. The rail sector makes a vital contribution to the European economy as a whole and to employment, directly employing more than 1 million people, of whom around 600 000 are employed in railway undertakings and 440 000 in infrastructure managers (by the end of 2016). Rail transport is also a key element of the EU's strategy to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, ensure economic and social cohesion and connecting Europeans within and between Member States. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a Single European Railway Area does not allow Member States, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, to respond to the unpredictable effects on rail transport by adapting, in particular, the rules on charging and capacity allocation. Targeted derogations should therefore be allowed in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on rail transport and to preserve the integrity of the single European railway area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation is intended to complete the existing rail-related framework in order to allow national authorities and rail stakeholders to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the urgent needs of the railway sector as long as those consequences persist. These temporary emergency measures concern notably the waiver, reduction or deferral of track access charges for the use of rail infrastructure, as well as the waiver of reservation charges. They cover a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, in respect of which charges may be altered, by derogation from Article 27 of Directive 2012/34/EU whereby the network statement (displaying all applicable charges) shall be published no less than for months in advance for the deadline for requests for infrastructure capacity. Income losses on the part of infrastructure managers as a result of the reductions envisaged in the proposed Regulation shall be reimbursed by Member States by 31 December of the year following the year in which the loss was incurred at the latest. The Commission may, by means of delegated acts, extend the time period during which the measures envisaged by the proposed Regulation apply."

BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Cape Verde entered into force on 30 March 2007. The current Protocol to the Agreement entered into force on 23 December 2014 and expires on 22 December 2018. The Commission has negotiated, on behalf of the European Union, a new Protocol on the implementation of the Agreement. At the end of the negotiations, the Protocol was initialled on 12 October 2018. The Protocol has been applied on a provisional basis from the date of its signature. It must now be approved on behalf of the Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to comply with the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-63/12, when the Council establishes that at this stage of the procedure there is a serious and sudden deterioration in the economic and social situation within the Union, the Commission must submit a Proposal under Article 336 in order to involve the European Parliament in the legislative process. Equally the Council and the European Parliament shall decide upon the Commission proposal having regard to the criteria set in Article 65 of the Staff Regulations respecting the rules set in Annex XI with the exception of its Article 3(2). The Court has confirmed that the Commission has a margin of appraisal that should be based on Article 65 of the Staff Regulations, as regards the content of appropriate proposals. The review of remuneration may, where appropriate, take into account other factors, such as the human resources management and in particular the needs of recruitment. Within this margin of appraisal, the Commission may base its decision upon economic and social data such as the 2011 stagnation and the ongoing crisis as well as the high level of unemployment rate and the high level of public deficit and debt in the European Union. The Commission has taken into account as well developments since 2011 such as the reform of the Staff Regulations and especially the two years freeze imposed to EU officials and the increase of weekly working time to 40 hours. According to the data supplied by Eurostat in agreement with the national statistical offices of the Member States, national civil servants lost 1.8% of their purchasing power, the same loss in purchasing power should have been applied to the EU officials and other servants for the period 1 July 2011 – 30 June 2012 if the Commission would have followed the normal application of the method. The Commission considered however as appropriate to reduce the proposed adjustment to remuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg to 0.9% instead of 1.7% with regard to the economic crisis and the efforts already consented by EU officials. The same approach would lead in 2012 to an adjustment of 0.9% instead of 1.7%. The total adjustment for both years would be therefore 47% lower than under the normal application of the method in force in 2011 and 2012. The Commission has proposed the above measures in order to involve the European Parliament in the legislative procedure and to allow the co-legislators to decide on the appropriate measures in accordance with Article 336 TFEU. Under Article 65 of the Staff Regulations the remuneration and pensions shall be updated before the end of each year, which is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: under this proposal, with effect from 1 July 2011, the table of basic monthly salaries applicable for the purposes of calculating remuneration and pensions shall be replaced by the proposed amendments in this proposal. The correction coefficients are also laid down in the proposal with the amended dates as regards: parental leave benefits, household allowance, dependent child allowance, education allowance, expatriation allowance, other types of compensation or unemployment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has a financial impact on all budgetary lines relating to staff expenditure in all Institutions and Agencies, i.e. it concerns expenditure for salaries of staff in headquarters and in delegations, contract agents, staff in the administrative offices, Members, parliamentary assistants, research staff, staff financed under BA-lines, staff paid under the provisions of early termination of service, pensions. In 2013, the budgetary impact of this change would be EUR 129 million and EUR 51.6 million/year in 2014 and subsequent years."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 requires new light-duty vehicles to comply with certain emission limits (Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards) and lays down additional requirements on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. Successive Euro emission standards have led to very significant drops in emissions of exhaust particles both in terms of mass (PM) and in terms of numbers (PN) and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). However, NOx emissions--and in particular nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions--from road transport have not been reduced as much as expected with the introduction of Euro standards since 1991. To deal with high on-road emissions from passenger vehicles, where a significant discrepancy with the laboratory testing was observed in recent years, the Commission developed the Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure, which applies from 1 September 2017. In December 2018, the Court annulled certain provisions of EU legislation relating to emissions tests under real driving conditions. In its judgment, the General Court did not question the technical necessity of the compliance factors, but considered that the Commission had exceeded its implementing powers by setting the RDE compliance factors under the comitology procedure and not under the ordinary legislative procedure. It therefore cancelled the part of Regulation (EU) 2016/646 that establishes the compliance factors. The annulment is of a partial nature and the RDE test procedure remains in force and must still be conducted at type-approval. To avoid legal uncertainty on the type approvals already granted since 1 September 2017, the General Court delays the effects of the annulment by a maximum period of 12 months, (i.e. 23 February 2020) to give time to the Commission to implement the judgment. The need to adopt the current proposal results directly from the Judgement of the General Court and its swift adoption is vital in order to avoid legal uncertainty on the type approvals already granted since 1 September 2017 as well as on the future type-approvals. CONTENT: in response to a ruling by the General Court, the Commission proposes to reinsert certain aspects of Real Driving Emissions testing (RDE) into legislation to be adopted by the European Parliament and Council. In doing so, the Commission aims to provide legal certainty to national authorities, industry and consumers. In order to avoid imposing an undue burden on manufacturers who have already designed their vehicles taking into account the previously adopted RDE procedure, the Commission proposes to reinsert the conformity factors for new car models of 2.1 until 2020 and the already revised technical margin of error of 1.43 after 2020 through the legislative procedure requested by the General Court. The Commission has kept the conformity factors unaltered in order to ensure stability for national authorities and the automotive sector. In addition, the Commission also proposes that the legislator empowers the Commission to annually review downwards the conformity factors set out by the legislator, in order to reflect the progress in accuracy of the portable measuring equipment. This will allow to gradually reduce even further the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) under real driving."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the Paris Agreement, the world has committed to move towards a low-carbon economy. Until now, the CO2 emission reduction standards for cars and vans in place in Europe have represented a fundamental tool to push for innovation and investments in low carbon technologies. However, in the absence of tighter standards for the period beyond 2020, the EU risks losing its technological leadership in this area. The current CO2 emission standards for cars and vans until 2020/21 have contributed to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from light duty vehicles. However, with current implemented policies GHG emissions are not expected to sufficiently decrease to reach the 2030 EU target of at least 40% emission reduction compared to 1990. This proposal is part of a broader mobility package which includes measures on the demand and supply of low-emission vehicles using alternative fuels through the proposed amendments to Directive 2009/33/EC on clean vehicles, Directive 92/106/EEC on combined transport and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 on passenger coach services. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options were grouped into five key elements. The preferred options within these groups are as follows: CO2 emission targets : to set new EU fleet-wide CO2 targets equal to a 30% reduction in 2030 compared to the 2021 targets, both for cars and for vans; distribution of effort amongst manufacturers from 2025 onwards ; incentives for low- and zero-emission vehicles (LEV/ZEV) : the use of a crediting system whereby a manufacturer exceeding a certain benchmark level of ZEV/LEV would be rewarded by getting a less strict CO2 target; elements for cost-effective implementation : to maintain the eco-innovation provisions, pooling provisions and derogations; strengthening of the governance : to establish an empowerment for the Commission to allow (i) the collection, publication and monitoring of real world fuel consumption data and creating an obligation to report deviations linked to a correction mechanisms and (ii) to correct reported CO2 emission values in case of deviations detected through improved market surveillance. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to set cost-effective CO2 emission reduction targets for new light-duty vehicles up to 2030 combined with a dedicated incentive mechanism to increase the share of zero/low-emission vehicles. More specifically, it will provide a clear signal and predictability for industry to invest, stimulate employment, foster innovation and competitiveness. In concrete terms, the proposed revision: specifies the EU fleet wide CO2 targets applicable to new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles from 2020, 2025 and 2030. The Regulation shall repeal Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 and shall apply from 2020 in order to ensure a coherent transition to a new target regime starting from 2025. It therefore includes the already established EU fleet wide targets for 2020 of 95g/km (NEDC based) for passenger cars and 147g/km (NEDC based) for light commercial vehicles, as well as new targets for 2025 and 2030. Starting from 2021, the specific emission targets will be based on the new emissions test procedure, the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP); defines the categories of vehicles that fall within the scope of this Regulation by reference to the type approval legislation. It also clarifies that the de minimis exemption applicable to manufacturers responsible for less than 1000 new registrations per year should not apply where a manufacturer eligible for such an exemption nevertheless applies for and is granted a derogation; sets out the general obligation for a manufacturer to ensure that the average CO2 emissions of its fleet of newly registered vehicles in a calendar year do not exceed its annual specific emissions target. Specific targets are laid down in the proposal. From 2025, the specific emissions target for a manufacturer should be calculated taking into account the share of zero- and low-emission vehicles in the manufacturer's fleet; sets out the formula for calculating the financial penalties in case a manufacturer exceeds its target. The excess emission premium from the existing Regulations is maintained, i.e. 95 euro/g CO2/km; maintains the possibility for small volume manufacturers (i.e. those responsible for 1 000 to 10 000 registrations for cars, and 1 000 to 22 000 registrations for vans) to apply for a derogation from their specific emissions targets. provides an empowerment for the Commission to monitor and assess the real world representativeness the WLTP test procedure and to ensure that the public is informed; clarifies the process for adjusting the reference mass value to ensure that the specific emission targets continue to reflect the EU fleet wide target; includes a requirement for the Commission to provide a report in 2024 on the effectiveness of this Regulation, where appropriate accompanied by a proposal. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards the interpretation of the eligibility criteria for derogations, the content of the applications, and the content and assessment of programmes for the reduction of specific emissions of CO2."
915EP7,"""""Pharmacovigilance (amendment of Directive 2001/83/EC)""""",0.719,0.832,0.649,0.581,0.394,0.783,0.738,0.686,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend, as regards pharmacovigilance, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council CONTENT: it is estimated that 5% of all hospital admissions are due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR), and that ADR is the fifth most common cause of hospital death. Some adverse reactions will only be detected after a medicine has been authorised and the full safety profile of medicinal products can only be known once they have entered the market. Pharmacovigilance rules are therefore necessary for the protection of public health in order to prevent, detect and assess adverse effects of medicinal products. The proposals aim at the strengthening and rationalising the Community pharmacovigilance system of medicinal products for human use The specific objectives are: providing clear roles and responsibilities for the key responsible parties and clear obligations; strengthening transparency and communication on medicine’s safety issues to increase the understanding and trust of patients and health professionals and improve the penetration of key warnings; strengthening companies' pharmacovigilance systems, allowing companies to improve their systems regularly whilst reducing administrative burden; introducing a risk management planning for each new medicinal product strengthening the reporting system for adverse reactions by rationalising current system and involving all stakeholders in pharmacovigilance ensuring the proactive and proportionate collection of high quality data relevant to the safety of medicines through risk management and structured data collection. In addition to achieving better protection of public health the proposals will also simplify the current EU procedures with consequent efficiency gains for both the pharmaceutical industry and medicines’ regulators. Clear roles and responsibilities : Member States should remain central to the operation of pharmacovigilance, with increased cooperation and work-sharing mechanisms (Member States not the Commission). companies’ responsibilities are clarified, in particular as regards the scope of their obligation to continuously monitor the safety of products thereby ensuring that all information available is brought to the attention of the authorities. a new scientific committee, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee, is created within the EMEA and it will play a key role in the pharmacovigilance assessments in the EU. the mandate of the coordination group composed of Member States representatives is enhanced for the sake of closer cooperation between the Member States and in order to increase work-sharing. the EU procedure for the assessment of serious safety issues for nationally authorised products is stream-lined through clear and binding initiation criteria for the Member States. Transparency and communication : clear, EU coordinated messages about specific safety risk issues: the Eudravigilance database should become the single point of receipt of pharmacovigilance information for medicinal products authorised in the EU. EU coordination of communication about safety issues and establishment of a European medicines safety web-portal. introduction of a new ‘key information' section in the summary of the product characteristics and the package leaflet. Pharmacovigilance obligations by industry: currently legislation requires a ‘detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system’ to be submitted in marketing authorisation applications. These proposals simplify the existing requirement by introducing the ""Pharmacovigilance system master file"". In the applications only key elements of the pharmacovigilance system should be submitted, but this is balanced with a requirement for companies to maintain a detailed file on site. Risk management planning and non-interventional safety studies : in the existing provisions, companies may provide a risk management system for specific medicinal products if considered appropriate, and there is no explicit legal basis for competent authorities to request it. These proposals require: a risk management system for each new medicinal product (or for existing products on the basis of safety concerns), which should be proportionate to the identified risks, potential risks, and the need for additional information on the medicinal product. harmonised guiding principles and a procedure for the supervision of non-interventional post-authorisation safety studies (i.e. safety studies of authorised products that are not clinical trials), in particular to ensure that they are non promotional, and the follow-up of any safety date generated in such studies. Adverse drug reaction case reports : current reports are submitted to several authorities if a product is authorised in more than one Member State , and lead to duplicative assessments as there is no provision to group assessments by products or substances. The proposals are intended: to make reporting proportionate to risks; to empower patients to report their side effects; to ensure that overdoses and medication errors are reported; to simplify adverse reaction reporting. It is proposed to report all adverse reaction data directly to the Eudravigilance database. for the Agency to take on a new task for the monitoring of selected scientific literature and for entering case reports of adverse effects onto the Eudravigilance database. for medication errors that result in an ADR to be reported to the competent authorities for medicines. Member State authorities should ensure that data is shared (including between the authorities for medicines and any authorities for patient safety) and make clear the legal basis for patients to report suspected adverse drug reactions. Periodic safety update reports and other safety related assessments : as there is currently no provision for group submissions and assessments on products or substances, this leads to duplicative submissions and assessments. The update of product information as a result of these assessments is not governed in detail by the actual legislation. The proposals: simplify periodic safety update report submission by industry and make it proportional to the knowledge about the safety/risk of the product; would introduce work-sharing mechanisms for the assessments, with a prominent role in all cases by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee, and faster updating of product information; amend the scope of periodic safety update reports to become an analysis of the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product rather than a detailed presentation of individual case reports as a result of the submission of all ADR data directly to the Eudravigilance database,; make the requirements for periodic safety update reports proportional to the risks posed by medicinal products, and routine reporting is no longer necessary for products considered low risk or where reporting would be duplicative (with the possibility for ad-hoc requests for such products). make explicit provision for the regulatory follow-up of assessments of periodic safety update reports, to ensure a clear link between pharmacovigilance evaluations and the review and updating of marketing authorisations authorised in the EU. create the framework for the shared use of resources between competent authorities for the assessment and follow-up of periodic safety update reports, with a strong involvement of the Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee. introduce a single assessment of periodic safety update reports for medicinal products authorised in more than one Member State,(including all products containing the same active substance),. This will also be the case for products authorised by the Member States and/or by the Commission. Lastly, the proposal also contains two provisions to improve the availability of medicine in Member States, in particular the smaller ones."

BACKGROUND: the 6th Environment Action Programme, approved in 2002, recognised that pesticide use impacts greatly both on human health and on the environment. Particular effort has been given, in particular, to reducing further still the use of pesticides for plant protection purposes. The Environment Action Programme underlines the need to achieve a more sustainable use of pesticides and to reduce the risk of pesticides. In addition, the Commission Communication “Towards a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides” (see INI/2002/2277), recognises the need for detailed, harmonised and up-to-date statistics on the sale and the use of pesticides at Community level. The Commission proposed to establish relevant mandatory requirements within two years of the adoption of the Thematic Strategy. Indeed, monitoring the risks related to the use of pesticides needs appropriate indicators. The Member States, the Commission and the OECD have already conducted preliminary studies which seek to establish such indicators. The calculation of risk indicators is possible only on the basis of suitable data – such as pesticide use. Experts have, however, expressed their concerns about the accessibility, transparency, adequacy and reliability of such data. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposed Regulation, therefore, is to create a legal framework that lays down harmonised rules for the collection and dissemination of data concerning the placing on the market and use of plant protection products. The Regulation instructs the Member States: to collect data regularly (annually as regards placing on the market and every five years as regards use); on how to collect data – such as representative surveys, statistical estimation procedures on the basis of expert judgements or models, reporting obligations imposed on the distribution chain for plant protection products, reporting obligations imposed on professional users, from administrative sources or by a combination of these means; on how to transmit date to the Commission. It also entrusts the Commission with the tasks of adapting some technical aspects and defining the quality evaluation criteria and the data transmission format. The financing of actions for statistics on plant protection products will be covered by the Community statistical programme 2008-2012. The proposal draws widely on the expertise of the 'Pesticide Statistics Experts Group'. It is also based on the experience gained through 30 pilot projects conducted between 1999 and 2004 within the technical action plan for improving agricultural statistics (TAPAS) and 10 projects carried out in 2005 in the new Member States and Acceding Countries with the support of the 2002 PHARE Multi-Beneficiary Programme for Statistical Co-operation."
753EP7,"""""Securities to be offered to the public and harmonisation of transparency requirements (amendment of Directives 2003/71/EC and 2004/109/EC)""""",0.632,0.729,0.053,0.258,0.273,0.711,0.769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directives 2003/71/EC on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and 2004/109/EC on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Council agreed, at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, that administrative burdens on companies should be reduced by 25% by the year 2012 in order to enhance the competitiveness of companies in the Community. Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and amending Directive 2001/34/EC has been identified by the Commission as one piece of legislation that contains a number obligations for companies, some of which seem burdensome. Those obligations need to be reviewed in order to reduce the burdens weighing on companies within the Community to the necessary minimum without compromising the protection of investors and the proper functioning of the securities markets in the Community. In order to further enhance investor protection and thus respond effectively to the current financial crisis, the summary of the prospectus should be improved in terms of simplicity and readability. This exercise will be consistent with the approach to be adopted following the Commission's Communication on Packaged Retail Investment Products, which aims for horizontal requirements on pre-contractual disclosures and selling practices for a wide range of retail investment product types (COM(2009)0204). This exercise is linked to the European Economic Recovery Plan and the financial services reform announced in the Communication of 4 March for the Spring European Council ""Driving European Recovery"" (see COM(2009)0114. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : p olicy options were considered for the following topics: divergent definitions of qualified investors in the Prospectus Directive and professional clients in Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments (MiFID); restriction of the choice of home Member State for the issuers of non-equity securities below EUR 1 000; clarification of the requirements in the Directive in case of subsequent placements of securities through financial intermediaries (retail cascade); regime for Employees Shares Schemes in the Directive; functioning of the summary of the prospectus; burdensome disclosure requirements in case of rights issues of listed companies, offers of non-equity securities issued by credit institutions above the threshold mentioned in the Directive, and offers of securities of issuers with reduced market capitalization; lack of harmonized liability rules; burdensome disclosure regime for government guarantee schemes; duplication of disclosure requirements; requirements in the Directive relating to the printed form of the prospectus; clarification of the obligation to supplement a prospectus and the exercise of the right of withdrawal provided by the Directive; requirements in the Directive relating to the translation of the summary of the prospectus. Each policy option was assessed against the following criteria: investor protection, consumer confidence, efficiency, clarity and legal certainty, and reduction of disproportionate and administrative burdens. In view of the conclusions reached in the impact assessment, the European Commission considers appropriate to present a proposal amending the Prospectus Directive in order to address the following issues: (i) retail cascade; (ii) definition of qualified investor/professional client; (iii) exercise of the right of withdrawal; (iv) lack of harmonised rules on liability; (v) summary of the prospectus; (vi) employee shares schemes; (vii) duplication of transparency obligations; (viii) choice of home Member State for the issuers of non-equity securities; (ix) rights issues; (x) small quoted companies and small credit institutions; (xi) government guarantee schemes. The impact assessment shows that the preferred options will have positive impacts for investors, companies raising capital, financial intermediaries, employees and SMEs. The identifiable reduction of administrative burdens from the preferred options amounts to approximately EUR 302 million on an annual basis. CONTENT: the overarching goal of the current proposal is to simplify and improve the application of the Prospectus Directive, increasing its efficiency and enhancing the EU's international competitiveness, bearing in mind the importance of enhancing the level of investor protection envisaged in the Directive and ensuring that the information provided is sufficient and adequate to cover the needs of retail investors, particularly in the context of the financial market turbulence that started in 2007. The main elements of the proposed directive are as follows: Calculation methods of maximum offering amounts : the way limits of maximum offering amounts are calculated in the Directive may lead to varying interpretations in the different Member States. Therefore, for reasons of certainty and efficiency, it should be clarified that the total consideration of the offers mentioned in the Directive should be computed on a Community wide basis and not on a country-by-country basis. Moreover, as the limits set out in the Directive may eventually become outdated, in order to take account of the technical developments in the financial markets and to ensure uniform application of the Directive, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing measures in relation to these limits. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. Retail cascade : it is proposed to amend the Prospectus Directive in order to clarify that intermediaries should not be obliged to produce a new prospectus for each subsequent offer as long as they have the possibility to use the initial prospectus of the issuer (with the condition that such a prospectus is valid in accordance with the Directive). Definition of qualified investor/professional client : the definition of qualified investor should be modified to encompass the persons that are considered professional clients under MiFID. Exercise of the right of withdrawal : the time frame for the exercise of the right of withdrawal in the Prospectus Directive should be harmonised in all EU Member States; nevertheless issuers should have the possibility to expand the time frame voluntarily. Lack of harmonised rules on liability : the harmonisation of the liability standards is a goal that exceeds the Prospectus Directive. It is proposed to keep the status quo as regards this issue. Summary of the prospectus : the content of the summary of the prospectus should be standardised following the approach adopted by the European Commission in its Communication on Packaged Retail Investment Products. Employee shares schemes : the exemption for employee shares schemes in the Prospectus Directive should be extended to employees of companies listed in markets other than EU regulated markets and non-listed companies. Duplication of transparency obligations : the disclosure requirements in the Prospectus Directive should be abolished. Choice of home Member State for the issuers of non-equity securities : issuers of non-equity should be entitled to choose a home Member State regardless of the denomination per unit of the offer. The threshold of EUR 1000 should be deleted from the Prospectus Directive. Rights issues : it is proposed to introduce the principle of a reduced disclosure regime for prospectuses for rights issues in the Directive; this regime should be supplemented through implementing measures, i.e. a modification in the implementing regulation. Small quoted companies and small credit institutions : the raise of capital of small quoted companies and small credit institutions should be subject to ""proportionate"" disclosure requirements. Article 5 of the Prospectus Directive should reflect this principle and the European Commission should be empowered to put in place implementing legislation specifying the disclosure requirements in this regard. Government Guarantee Schemes : the Prospectus Directive should clarify that issuers of securities guaranteed by a Member State are not obliged to include in the prospectus information about the State guarantor (though it should contain information about the guarantee). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."
5985EP7,"""""Interoperability of the rail system""""",0.421,0.886,0.93,0.581,0.273,0.892,0.841,0.486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the Single European Railway Area in the field of interoperability (fourth railway package). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directive 2008/57/EC on railway interoperability). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the last decade, the EU railway market has witnessed profound changes, gradually introduced by three legislative ‘railway packages’ intended to open up the national markets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level, while maintaining high level of safety. However, the modal share of rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. This is why the Commission has put forward the Fourth Railway Package in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing the remaining market obstacles. This proposal for a Directive, along with the proposal to recast Directive 2004/49/EC on rail safety, are part of this fourth package which focuses on the removal of remaining administrative and technical barriers by: establishing a common approach to safety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway undertakings active across the EU; decreasing administrative costs, accelerating administrative procedures, as well as avoiding disguised discrimination, relying on the European Railways Agency. Several lessons have been learned based on the work done on developing technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) and the application of the interoperability Directives to specific projects. Furthermore, the legislative context for the marketing of products has evolved in recent years, with the result that the interoperability legislation needs to be updated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment. In order to support the Commission in the impact assessment process, an external consultant was tasked to prepare an impact assessment support study and to undertake a targeted consultation of stakeholders. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1), Article 170 and Article 171 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission’s proposal to amend Directive 2008/57/EC may be summarised as follows: as regards the scope, the interoperability of local, urban and suburban systems is considered to have been adequately addressed in the voluntary field and does not need to be covered by this Directive; several definitions were reworded or added; further provisions are to be specified in the TSIs to cover existing subsystems and to enable railway undertakings to check compatibility between vehicles and routes on which these vehicles are intended to be operated; the use of Agency opinions pending the amendment of TSIs as a result of deficiencies discovered, is clarified; the cases of possible non-application of TSIs have been reduced; the role of national rules, the cases in which national rules may be introduced, and the procedures for their withdrawal and their publication have been clarified, as have the circumstances which trigger a new EC declaration of verification; the placing on the market of mobile subsystems, which can be done by both railway undertakings and manufacturers; a new provision introduces the notion of vehicle authorisation for placing on the market. This authorisation is issued by the Agency and contains all information needed later by the railway undertaking to place a vehicle in commercial service. An optional complementary statement will facilitate the railway undertaking in its task of placing the vehicle in service; the role of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers in checking the technical compatibility of the vehicle with the route and the safe integration of the vehicle in the system in which it is intended to operate is clarified; two new articles concerning conformity assessment bodies replace and complement some existing provisions to include the provisions of the new legislative framework for the marketing of products as defined in Decision 768/2008/EC; articles on European Vehicle Number (EVN) and registers have been updated; as a consequence of the Lisbon Treaty, a certain number of the annexes of Directive 2008/57/EC into implementing acts to be adopted by the Commission. It should be noted that the fourth railway package also includes: (i) a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and (ii) a proposal amending Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: concerned at the decline of the European railway sector witnessed since the 1970s, the European Community adopted a certain number of legislative measures aimed at reviving the railways by gradually creating a “single European railway area”. The first railway package Directive 2001/12/EC, Directive 2001/12/EC and Directive 2001/13/EC -adopted at the end of 2000 signalled the desire to reform the regulatory framework to ensure the railway sector's integration at European level and to enable it to face up to the competition from other transport modes on the best possible terms. With this new regulatory framework, the railway industry has managed to stabilise the volumes transported and, in some Member States, to recover market share from the roads. However, the growth of rail freight in terms of tonnes transported during recent years has not been strong enough to recover the market share of 2.3 percentage points lost between 1995 and 2003. The current economic climate is exacerbating the weak performance of the rail market. Freight services (including rail) have recently suffered a significant drop in activity (between 20% and 50% depending on the market segment) and passenger service activity has also slowed. The development of the railway sector and its capacity to compete viably with other modes of transport are still hampered by serious problems related to (a) inadequate financing and pricing of the infrastructure, (b) persistent barriers to competition and (c) lack of appropriate regulatory oversight. Two problems need to be addressed: the level of investment in rail infrastructure development and maintenance remains insufficient in a large number of Member States. In many cases, the quality of the infrastructure continues to decline: competition between railway undertakings is limited by various factors. Insufficient transparency of market conditions and a poorly functioning institutional framework continue to make it difficult for new entrants to provide competitive rail services. T here are weaknesses, ambiguities and gaps in the current regulatory framework which need to be addressed to meet fully the initial objectives of the legislation. A recast of the first railway package is considered by the Commission as one of the ways to tackle them. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on extensive research and evaluation, the Commission came up with 37 measures that could potentially contribute to achieving each of the objectives of the proposal. A thorough pre-screening of these 37 measures resulted in the selection of a package of 26 measures. Following the decision to carry out an impact assessment for an initiative to recast the first railway package, an external study was commissioned to PriceWaterhouseCoopers Advisory(PWC). A stakeholders’ consultation involving almost 380 organisations was carried out in the context of the external study undertaken by PWC. Based on the external study, as well as the conclusions of the stakeholders' consultation process, the Commission made a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the impact of the whole package of pre-selected measures. It examined alternative options for the new measures envisaged to modernise the existing regulatory framework, some of which had not previously been subject to impact assessment. LEGAL BASE: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed recast has three horizontal objectives: 1) The simplificati on, clarification and modernisation of the regulatory environment in Europe : legal simplificationthrough consolidation and merger is the first horizontal objective underpinning this recast initiative. Elimination of existing cross-references of the three Directives through restructuring and merging into a single rail access code would be instrumental in attaining this objective. 2) The clarification of some provisions of rail access legislation would facilitate proper transposition and efficient implementation of European Union law in all Member States. 3) The modernisation of the legislation by eliminating outdated provisions and the introduction of new provisions which respond more appropriately to the functioning of the market today (e.g. relating to new entrants and full or partial State ownership of infrastructure). The proposed recast of the first railway package encompasses (a) the adequate financing of and charging for rail infrastructures, (b) the conditions of competition on the railway market, and (c) the organisational reforms needed to ensure appropriate supervision of the market. The first objective consists of e nsuring adequate, transparent and sustainable funding of the infrastructure and, thanks to better predictability of the infrastructure development and access conditions, i) facilitating investments by railway undertakings, together with a more appropriate level and structure of infrastructure charging, ii) improving the competitiveness of rail operators vis-à-vis other transport modes and iii) contributing to the internalisation of environmental costs The second series of objectives involves i) avoiding distortions of competition due to the use of State funds for commercial activities, ii) preventing commercially sensitive information from being collected by incumbents and used against their potential competitors, iii) eliminating conflicts of interest in the management of rail-related services and iv) increasing their availability for new entrants as well as v) increasing market transparency to ensure effective competition. Regarding regulatory oversight, the proposed recast intends to ensure that regulatory bodies are in a position to carry out their duties effectively, thanks to reinforced independence, extended competencies, and additional means at their disposal. The main proposed amendments are as follows: the separation of accounts between the activities that enjoy a legal monopoly from those that are subject to competition; the obligation for Member States to publish medium to long-term railway sector development strategies that make it possible to meet future mobility needs and are based on sound and sustainable financing of the railway system. It will stimulate long lifecycle investments on which the rail industry relies; a clarification of the general principles applying to cross-agreements between rail undertakings, between Member States, and between Member States and third countries; the updating of the provisions relating to the responsibilities of the regulatory bodies. Their competences will explicitly cover decisions related to access to and charging for rail-related services which are essential to allow market entry and ensure fair competition; to enhance cross-border cooperation and improve market entry conditions, regulatory bodies will have to cooperate for the adoption of decisions on access or charging issues relating to international services; the rail market monitoring tasks of the Commission will cover items such as rail infrastructure investments, price developments and quality of rail transport services and public service obligations for rail passenger transport. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 contains a ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule, whereby air carriers must use at least 80% of their allocated slots within a given scheduling period (summer or winter) in order to keep precedence in respect of the same series of slots within the corresponding scheduling period of the next year (so-called ‘grandfather rights’). Due to the reduced demand for passenger traffic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, air carriers have already started and will continue to cancel flights, which will result in slot usage for the winter 2019-2020 and summer 2020 scheduling periods below the 80 % threshold imposed by the Regulation. According to Eurocontrol, the number of flights fell by 10% in the first two weeks of March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Given the decreasing demand caused by the crisis, most European air carriers are grounding aircraft. European airports expect a loss of 67 million passengers in the first quarter of 2020. This phenomenon is seriously affecting air transport across the Union. On the basis of the information currently available from Eurocontrol, from air carriers and from airports, it is reasonable to assume that the current situation, characterised by an exceptional fall in demand, will last at least for the months of March, April, May and June 2020. In the absence of any measure neutralising, for the purposes of this calculation, the effects of the current circumstances, it is likely that air carriers will operate many flights with very low load factors in order to protect their grandfather rights, thus exacerbating financial losses and causing an adverse impact on the environment. CONTENT: in order to allow airlines to adapt their capacity in light of the decline in demand caused by the epidemic, and to protect the financial health of airlines and the environment, the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 in order to protect the grandfather rights of air carriers for those slots that have not been used during the period when the aviation market has been most affected by the outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19). The proposed period covers the four-month period between March 2020 and June 2020 for all flights. The proposed amendment would come in form of a rule whereby coordinators shall consider slots allocated for the reference periods in question as having been operated. This rule would mitigate the effects of the current crisis and provide legal certainty to the air carriers for the relevant parts of the scheduling periods. Any slots freed by air carriers as a result could be reallocated by coordinators according to needs. The Commission may extend the period during which the measures are applicable, if necessary by means of delegated acts. The Commission shall base such decisions on the most recent information available, published by Eurocontrol, and on relevant scientific advice. Additionally, given that the severe impact of the outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 virus became apparent first in China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, it is proposed to protect during a longer overall period the grandfathering rights for slots used for air services to and from those markets. The additional period starts on 23 January 2020, the date on which the first airport in the People’s Republic of China was closed by the authorities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: tackling unemployment and persistently high rates of poverty remains a priority throughout the EU. Social and employment issues are a primary concern of European citizens. Targeted support measures are needed to address the challenges identified in the European Semester and in the European Pillar of Social Rights proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission: shortfalls in skill levels, under-performance in active labour market policy, problems arising from new technologies such as automation and new forms of work, social exclusion and low labour mobility. In this context, this Commission proposes to make the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) the EU’s main instrument to invest in people by merging the following funds and programmes: the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI); the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD); the Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) programme; the Programme for the Union’s action in the field of health (the Health Programme). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European Social Fund plus (ESF+). It lays down the objectives of the ESF+, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the methods of implementation, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The ESF+ shall support policies and priorities which aim to help create full employment, enhance quality and productivity at work, increase the geographical and occupational mobility of workers within the Union, improve education and training systems, and promote social inclusion and health. The overarching policy objective of the ESF+ Regulation shall be to help create a more performing and resilient ‘Social Europe’ and implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as the social and employment priorities endorsed by the European economic governance process. Actions under the shared management strand of the ESF+ shall also contribute to achieving the strategic objectives set out in the proposed Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) in particular: · a smarter Europe through the development of skills for smart specialisation, skills for key enabling technologies, industrial transition; · a greener, low carbon Europe through the improvement of education and training systems necessary for the adaptation of skills and qualifications, the creation of new jobs in sectors related to the environment, climate and energy, and the bioeconomy. Shared management strand : under the proposal, Member States shall: allocate an appropriate amount of their ESF+ resources under shared management to address challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations; allocate at least 25% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to the specific objectives for the social inclusion policy area, including the promotion of the socio-economic integration of third country nationals; allocate at least 2% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to the specific objective of addressing material deprivation. The European Fund for the most deprived (FEAD) shall continue to benefit from simpler rules, to ensure that the Fund is accessible to an even wider range of beneficiaries, such as small non-governmental organisations. Member States with a rate of young people aged 15-29 not in employment, education or training (NEET) above a certain threshold shall devote 10% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to targeted actions and structural reforms to support young people. In the case of the outermost regions with a NEET rate above this threshold, this percentage shall be increased to 15%. The proposal defines the rules on eligibility and control, in addition to the future CPR for all ESF+ support under shared management (with the exception of support to combat material deprivation). There is also a provision on ‘innovative actions’, which encourages Member States to support social innovation and social experimentation, which strengthen bottom-up approaches based on partnerships. Direct and indirect management strand : Under the employment and social innovation strand, ESF+ support shall allow innovative solutions to be tested and evaluated before they are applied on a larger scale to help improve policies, for example by supporting worker mobility in Europe. Under the health strand, support shall focus on priority areas where cooperation at European level has a proven advantage: disease prevention, crisis preparedness for cross-border health threats, assistance to Member States' health authorities, digitisation of health and care systems, support for EU health legislation and strengthening cross-border cooperation, for example on rare diseases. Proposed budget : the Commission proposes to allocate a total budget of EUR 101 billion (in current prices) to ESF+ for the period 2021-2027 , of which EUR 100 billion for the shared management strand of ESF+. The financial envelope for the direct management strands of the ESF+ would amount to EUR 1 174 million in current prices, of which EUR 761 million for employment and social innovation and EUR 413 million for health."

The extension of the Protocol to the existing Agreement would make it possible to avoid interrupting the fishing activities of European vessels when the protocol expires on 13 October 2020, pending the finalisation of the negotiations on the renewal of the protocol. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands concerning the extension for one year of the framework established by the Protocol expiring on 13 October 2020. The aim of the Agreement is also to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Cook Islands, in the interests of both parties. The current EU-Cook Islands protocol allows the EU fleet to fish in the Cook Islands waters for tuna species, for indicative annual fishing opportunities of 7 000 tonnes. The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 700 000, based on: (a) an annual amount for access to fishery resources for the categories provided for in the Protocol, set at EUR 350 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol; (b) support for the development of the Cook Islands’ sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 350 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of the Cook Islands’ national policy on the sustainable management of their maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol."

Parliament gave its consent to the draft Council decision. The Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) is an EU funding programme that finances research projects in the coal and steel sectors. The RFCS has its own legal bases standing outside the Multiannual Financial Framework. The Commission proposal foresees amendments to the current Decision 2003/76/EC. It aims to allow for the sale of part of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation for the period 2021-2027 in order to provide an annual allocation to the RFCS of EUR 111 million to finance research in the coal and steel sectors, namely: - EUR 40 billion to fund collaborative research in these sectors and; - EUR 71 billion to fund research into breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel making and research projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closure, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism. The proposal does not create any new liabilities to be charged to the General Budget under the current multiannual financial framework (MFF). With the exception of some carry-over due to payment requests still to be satisfied within the annual allocation, the assets will stabilise after 2027 and will not be further reduced. In other words, based on the proposal the assets left intact after 2027 should still be intact in 2050, bar the (positive or negative) effect of the ECSC portfolio performance."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in recent years, the challenge posed by corporate income tax avoidance has increased considerably and has become a major focus of concern within the Union and globally. The Commission in its communications entitled ‘Commission Work Programme 2016 - No time for business as usual’ and ‘Commission Work Programme 2015 - A New Start’ identified as a priority the need to move to a system whereby the country in which profits are generated is also the country of taxation. The Commission announced in March 2015, a comprehensive list of initiatives in its Action Plan on a Fairer Corporate Tax System and proposed as part of the subsequent Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (ATAP), to implement in the Union Action 13 of the OECD Action Plan endorsed by the G20 to fight base erosion and profit shifting (hereafter, BEPS). Responding to the calls from the G20 and elsewhere, greater transparency on the side of companies is needed to enable public scrutiny of whether tax is paid where profits are produced. The European Parliament in its resolution of 16 December 2015 on bringing transparency, coordination and convergence to corporate tax policies in the Union acknowledged that increased transparency in the area of corporate taxation can improve tax collection, make the work of tax authorities more efficient and ensure increased public trust and confidence in tax systems and governments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option identified in the impact assessment is the one concerning a public country-by-country reporting on worldwide operations broken down by EU Member State and aggregated for non-EU operations. In terms of societal benefits, this initiative responds to the increased demand for transparency regarding the tax affairs of multinational enterprise groups. By providing more information in a more convenient form, it should also contribute to increasing public trust in the fairness of the tax systems. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Directive 2013/34/EU with a view to providing the tax administration with a complete set of information required to consider potential harmful tax practices rather than to provide the wider public with a general set of country-by-country data to improve transparency. It requires the multinational enterprises to disclose publicly certain items of the information submitted to tax authorities. Scope of the proposal : the proposal applies to all EU and non-EU MNEs with a consolidated turnover of at least EUR 750 million, having activities in the EU by way of at least an establishment. This is the same threshold as that set out in the OECD/BEPS and in the ATAP. According to the OECD, based on this threshold, only 10-15% of MNEs will be required to submit a CBCR; but the turnover of those MNEs will represent approximately 90% of the turnover of all MNEs. Small and medium-sized companies, who represent more than 95 % of all companies in the EU, are not affected by the proposal. For any MNE headquartered in a third country, the obligation will fall on its subsidiaries or branches in the EU unless the non-EU MNE makes the CBCR group report publicly accessible and indicates which subsidiary or branch in the EU is responsible for the publication of the CBCR on behalf of the ""parent"" company. Banking groups : where these are multinational enterprises which fall within the scope of this initiative, they will be exempted from the obligation to report on income tax information, provided that the report disclosed under Article 89 of Directive 2013/36/EU encompasses the activities of the ultimate parent undertaking in the EU and of all of its affiliated undertakings. Content of the report on income tax information : disclosed information includes: (i) the nature of the activities, (ii) the number of persons employed; (iii) the net turnover made (including with related parties); (iv) the profit made before tax; (v) the amount of income tax due in the country as a reason of the profit made in the current year; (vi) the actual payments made to the country's treasury during that year; (vii) the amount of accumulated earnings. In order to ensure a level of detail that will enable citizens to better assess how MNEs contribute to welfare in each Member State, the information should be broken down by Member State. In addition, because some third countries refuse to respect good governance standards in taxation and pose specific tax challenges, the information on operations of MNEs should also be shown with a high level of detail. Publication : the consolidated report on income tax information will be published in a business register with the objective of ensuring certainty and availability over time. Moreover, as the objective of this initiative is to enable public scrutiny, those reports will also be made accessible to the public on company websites. To allow for comparisons over time, reports will remain accessible for at least five consecutive years on the websites. Enforcement : enforcement of this initiative will be ensured with a combination of provisions. Member States should introduce collective responsibility of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies for these reports. The statutory auditor of any local subsidiary in charge will have to verify whether the CBCR has been provided and made accessible on the Internet. In the case of a branch of a third country multinational enterprises, that responsibility will be borne by those persons in charge of disclosure formalities. Lastly, Directive 2013/34/EU will apply, ensuring that infringements will be sanctioned by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for MNEs or their subsidiaries or branches. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the proposal concerns the following 8 metrology Directives: Directive 75/33/EEC on Cold Water Meters for Non-Clean Water; Directives 76/765/EEC and 76/766/EEC on Alcohol Meters and Alcohol Tables; Directives 71/317/EEC and 74/148/EEC on Medium and Above-Medium Accuracy Weights respectively; Directive 86/217/EEC on Tyre Pressure Gauges for Motor Vehicles; Directive 71/347/EEC on Standard Mass of Grain; Directive 71/349/EEC on Calibration of Ship Tanks. From the public consultation and an external study, it appears that there are no obstacles to trade in the 6 sectors covered by the 8 old approach Directives. It is also apparent that the Directives concern instruments increasingly less in use. Technical progress and innovation with regard to measuring instruments covered by the Directives being repealed is ensured in practice either by the voluntary application of the international and European standards which have been developed or by the application of national provisions implementing such new specifications. Furthermore, the free circulation within the internal market of all products concerned by them is ensured by the satisfactory application of Articles 28 to 30 of the EC Treaty and of the mutual recognition principle. The repeal of the Directives should not lead to any new barriers to the free movement or to additional administrative burdens. Furthermore, while respecting the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity, there is no evidence of a common need for a higher level of consumer protection. The repeal of the Directives should not affect existing EEC pattern approvals and EEC certificates until the end of their validity."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the policies relating to the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice have been growing steadily over the last years. Their importance has been confirmed by the Stockholm Programme and its Action Plan, the implementation of which is a strategic priority for the next five years and covers areas such as migration (legal migration and integration; asylum; irregular migration and return), security (prevention of and fight against terrorism and organised crime; police cooperation) and management of the external borders (including visa policy), as well as the external dimension of these policies. The Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020: a budget for delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. In the area of home affairs policies, covering security, migration and the management of external borders, the Commission proposed to simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to a two pillar structure: an Asylum and Migration Fund and an Internal Security Fund. This Regulation establishes the Asylum and Migration Fund which draws on the capacity building process developed with the assistance of the European Refugee Fund4, the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals5 and the European Return Fund and extends it to cover more comprehensively different aspects of the common Union asylum and immigration policy. Recent events at the Greek/Turkish border and in the Southern Mediterranean have also demonstrated how important it is for the Union to have a comprehensive approach to migration, covering various aspects such as: strengthened border management and Schengen governance, better targeted legal migration, enhanced dissemination of best practices on integration, a reinforced Common European Asylum System, and a more strategic approach to relations with third countries on migration. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. Work on the preparation of the future financial instruments for home affairs started in 2010 and continued into 2011. It was completed in July 2011 and brought together available evaluation results for the existing financial instruments and informed the problems, objectives and policy options, including their likely impact, examined in the impact assessment. On the basis of this study, the Commission drafted an impact assessment report. The main conclusion may be summarised as follows: to broaden the scope of action for Union funding in the field of asylum and migration, including as regards its external dimension, to work towards more simplification of delivery mechanisms and greater flexibility, notably to respond to emergencies. In the area of asylum and migration, stakeholders considered that the broad thematic priorities have already been fixed by the Stockholm Programme and its Action Plan. There was broad support to reduce the number of financial instruments to a two-Fund structure on the condition that this would actually lead to simplification. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 78(2) and 79(2) and (4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 the Asylum and Migration Fund. General objective : the general objective of the Fund shall be to contribute to an effective management of migration flows in the Union as part of the area of freedom, security and justice, in accordance with the common policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection and the common immigration policy. Specific objectives : within its general objective, the Fund shall contribute to the following specific objectives: to strengthen and develop the Common European Asylum System, including its external dimension; to support legal migration to the Union in line with the economic and social needs of Member States and promote the effective integration of third-country nationals, including of asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection; to enhance fair and effective return strategies in the Member States with emphasis on sustainability of return and effective readmission in the countries of origin; to enhance the solidarity and responsibility sharing between the Member States, in particular towards those most affected by migration and asylum flows. For each of these objectives, key indicators are defined. Actions in or in relation to third countries : the Fund shall support actions catering primarily for Union interests, having a direct impact in the Union and its Member States and ensuring a necessary continuity with activities implemented in the territory of the Union. Actions that are directly development oriented shall not be supported through this Fund. In implementing such actions, full coherence will be sought with the principles and general objectives of the Union external action related to the country or region in question. Implementation : the specific implementing measures are laid down in a separate Regulation (Horizontal Regulation). Resources for Member States : t he most important part of the resources available under the Fund will be channelled through national programmes of Member States covering the whole period 2014-2020. For this purpose, the amount of resources to be allocated to the Member States within the Fund will be composed of a basic amount and a variable amount. Following a mid-term review an additional amount may be allocated as of budget year 2018. (1) Basic amount : the b asic amount is established on the basis of latest available statistical data relating to the migration flows, such as the number of first asylum applications, positive decisions granting refugee or subsidiary protection, number of resettled refugees, stock and flows of legally residing third-country nationals, number of return decisions issued by the national authorities and the number of effected returns. Those data are the same as those used so far for the calculation of allocations under the European Refugee Fund, the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals and the European Return Fund. In order to ensure critical mass for the implementation of national programmes, EUR 5 million is added as a minimum amount to each Member State. The basic amounts earmarked to individual Member States will serve as a basis to start the policy dialogue , followed by the multiannual programming, to support, on the hand, a limited number of compulsory objectives (e.g. strengthening the establishment of Common European Asylum System by ensuring the efficient and uniform application of the Union acquis on asylum or developing an assisted voluntary return programme including a component on reintegration) and, on the other hand, to address the specific needs of each Member State. (2) Variable amount : the variable amount will be allocated following the policy dialogue mentioned above to those Member States willing to work in those operational fields which depend on their political commitment and willingness to act, or ability to cooperate with other Member States. This will be the case for the implementation of specific actions such as for: instance joint processing of asylum applications, joint return operations, setting up of joint migration centres, the implementation of resettlement and relocation operations. As regards resettlement : Member States will receive financial incentives (lump sums) every two years on the basis of their pledging which will follow the establishment of common Union resettlement priorities. These will be the result of a political process involving in particular the European Parliament and the Council and reflecting the policy developments at national and Union level. Through these financial incentives, two objectives are to be achieved: a quantitative one, i.e. to increase significantly the current resettlement figures which are too small, and a qualitative one, i.e. to strengthen the European dimension through the implementation of defined and dynamic common Union resettlement priorities. Moreover, based on a similar pledging exercise and at regular intervals, Member States will receive financial incentives (lump sums) for relocation of beneficiaries of international protection. Mid-term allocation : a part of available resources will be kept for mid-term review. This will, on the one hand, allow allocating additional amounts to those Member States undergoing significant changes in migration flows and presenting specific needs concerning their asylum and reception systems and, on the other hand, to allocate additional amounts to those Member States willing to implement specific actions. The latter may be revised in line with the most recent policy developments. Union Agencies : to use more effectively the competence and expertise of relevant Union agencies in the home affairs field, the Commission also envisages to make use of the possibility offered by the Financial Regulation to entrust, within the resources available under this Regulation, the implementation of specific tasks to such agencies, in the framework of their missions and in complementarity with their work programmes. For the tasks covered by this Regulation this concerns in particular the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex Agency) for activities in and outside the EU requiring operational expertise on issues related to asylum and irregular immigration, respectively. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to supplement or amend provisions of this Regulation on the lump sums for resettlement and relocation, the definition of specific actions and of common Union resettlement priorities, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the Commission's proposal for a Multi-Annual Financial Framework includes a proposal of EUR 3 869 million (in current prices) for Asylum and Migration Fund for the period 2014-2020. Indicatively more than 80% of this amount (EUR 3 232 million) should be used for national programmes of Member States while EUR 637 million should be centrally managed by the Commission to fund Union actions, emergency assistance, European Migration Network, technical assistance and the implementation of specific operational tasks by Union agencies."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency, the aim of the proposal is to proceed with the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2000 on the European Union trade mark. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. EU trade mark : the draft regulation establishes, at Union level, the modalities and the conditions for the grant of an EU trade mark. An EU trade mark shall have a unitary character. It shall have equal effect throughout the Union. The proposal also sets up a European Union Intellectual Property Office. The rights in an EU trade mark should not be obtained otherwise than by registration, and registration should be refused in particular if the trade mark is not distinctive, if it is unlawful or if it conflicts with earlier rights. An EU trade mark may consist of any signs, in particular words, including personal names, or designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of the packaging of goods, or sounds provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. Rights conferred by an EU trade mark : the proprietor of that EU trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade, in relation to goods or services, any sign where: the sign is identical with the EU trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered; the use of the sign means that there is likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, including the likelihood of association between the sign and the trade mark. The exclusive rights conferred by an EU trade mark should not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use of signs or indications by third parties which are used fairly and thus in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Application: an application for an EU trade mark shall be filed at the Office. It shall contain: a request for the registration of an Î1 EU trade mark ; information identifying the applicant; a list of the goods or services in respect of which the registration is requested; a representation of the mark. The application for an EU trade mark shall be subject to the payment of the application fee. Where an application meets the requirements set out in the Regulation and where no notice of opposition has been given, the trade mark and the particulars shall be recorded in the Register. The registration shall be published, and the Office shall issue a certificate of registration. Duration and renewal : EU trade marks shall be registered for a period of 10 years from the date of filing of the application. Registration may be renewed for further periods of 10 years at the request of the proprietor, provided that the fees have been paid. The request for renewal shall be submitted in the six-month period prior to the expiry of the registration. Surrender, revocation and invalidity : an EU trade mark may be surrendered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered. The rights of the proprietor of the EU trade mark shall be declared to be revoked on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim: if, within a continuous period of five years, the trade mark has not been put to genuine use in the Union ç in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered; if, in consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, the trade mark has become the common name in the trade for a product or service; if, in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor, the trade mark is liable to mislead the public. An EU trade mark shall be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings where there is an earlier trade mark in accordance with EU or national law. The decisions of the Office will be subject to appeal. EU certification marks : the Regulation states that such a mark shall be an EU trade mark which is described as such when the mark is applied for and is capable of distinguishing goods or services which are certified by the proprietor of the mark in respect of material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services, quality, accuracy or other characteristics, with the exception of geographical origin, from goods and services which are not so certified.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Grenada were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andGrenada on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Grenada when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Grenada to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Grenada may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Grenada remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Grenada reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Grenada to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down essential provisions on the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants and type-approval for internal combustion engines for non-road mobile machinery, and empowers the Commission to lay down the technical specifications in delegated and implementing acts. Article 55(2) of that Regulation conferred this delegation of power to the Commission for a limited period of five years, which expired on 6 October 2021. As there is a need to update elements of the type-approval legislation to technical progress or to introduce other amendments in line with the empowerments, including a delegated act that sets in-service monitoring requirements for internal combustion engines installed in non-road mobile machinery, it is necessary to extend the power conferred on the Commission to adopt delegated acts, with the possibility of a further extension. CONTENT: the proposal amends Article 55(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 to provide for an additional five-year empowerment (until 6 October 2026) with the possibility of tacit extension for five-year periods."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy, as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is to ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. The Union is Party to the ICCAT, the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas to which the Union is a Contracting Party. The ICCAT has the authority to adopt decisions (“recommendations”) for fisheries conservation and management in its area of competence; these acts are binding. Certain ICCAT BFT measures were transposed through Regulation (EU) No 544/2014 which amended Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009. The purpose of that amendment was to transpose the measures on fishing seasons adopted by ICCAT in 2012 and 2013. With a view to ensure uniform and effective application throughout the European Union of all measures of the Recovery plan adopted between 2012 and 2014, the current proposal will incorporate them into a Regulation concerning a multiannual recovery plan for BFT in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. This Regulation will repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009. CONTENT: the objective of the proposed Regulation, in line with the Recovery plan, is to achieve a biomass corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield by 2022 with at least 60% probability. The proposal aims at transposing into Union law measures of the multiannual Bluefin Tuna (BFT) recovery plan in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) at its annual meetings between 2012 and 2014. It contains technical measures such as those on transfer and caging operations of live BFT, including also measures on the use of stereoscopic cameras to estimate the quantities of BFT and releases, catch reporting requirements, and the implementation of the ICCAT Regional Observer Programme. The new Regulation on the CFP introduced a landing obligation which applies as of 1 January 2015 to Bluefin tuna. Under that Regulation, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, for the purpose of implementing such international obligations into Union law, including, in particular, derogations from the landing obligation. Accordingly, the discard of bluefin tuna will be allowed in some situations laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2015/98. This Regulation does therefore not need to cover such discard obligations. DELEGATED ACT: the proposal contains provisions to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

Recalling that poverty reduction and eradication is the EU's primary development policy objective and one of the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Members call for more resolute to enhance the impact of EU development aid. The following recommendations are made to this effect: High-impact development policy : reiterating its call for incorporation of the EDF into the EU budget, Members call for the strengthening of aid effectiveness. Efforts must be made in order to: better assess the projects and policies funded by the EU; enhance the promotion of good governance and the fight against corruption in beneficiary countries; enhance capacity development to improve the capability of citizens, organisations, governments and societies to design sustainable development strategies; enhance democratic ownership (parliaments, local and regional authorities, civil society and other stakeholders); enable meaningful participation for citizens in Civil Society Organisations; highlight the role played by local and regional authorities and their networks. Parliament stresses that the aim of increasing the impact of aid and obtaining more results/value for money should not lead to a risk-averse development policy that only focuses on ‘easy countries’. The resolution insists that poverty eradication and needs must remain the crucial criteria for the allocation of EU development aid and that aid effectiveness must be improved by focusing on tangible results. They call on the Commission and the Member States to review the scope of financing instruments and to focus the disbursement of Official Development Assistance (ODA) on the poorest and most vulnerable countries and on reaching the poorest layers of society particularly those facing the greatest risks of social exclusion, such as women, children, elderly people and people with disabilities while taking into consideration the results achieved and the impact of aid. Parliament stresses the need to distinguish between the development needs of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and those of the Middle Income Countries (MICs), especially the emerging donors (to recall, 72% of the world's poor live in MICs). Furthermore, Parliament takes the view that the EU's development policy should aim at eliminating obstacles to development, such as dumping of agricultural products, illegitimate debt burden, capital flight and unfair trade, and at creating an international environment conducive to fighting poverty, guaranteeing decent incomes and livelihoods and to the fulfilment of basic human rights, including social and economic rights. It reiterates the principle of the universality of human rights. It believes that in order to guarantee high impact the EU development policy should have an incentive-based approach based on greater differentiation by rewarding those countries that are performing well and supporting those that are most off track. Meeting financial commitments : Parliament reaffirms its position according to which the collective target of devoting 0.7% of the Union’s Gross National Income (GNI) to ODA by 2015 must be met. It urges the Commission and Member States to find new sources of development funding such as a financial transaction tax at global level, private-sector finance and market-orientated solutions. They oppose any alteration or broadening of the definition of ODA, as set by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. Once again, Members call for increased efforts in the areas of development education and awareness-raising in Europe. Members underline that aid should be provided in a predictable manner that is aligned with national plans and priorities and provides incentives for greater transparency and accountability from donor governments, NGOs, and partner states. Promoting pro-poor growth : Parliament stresses that growth is only one instrument among many, and that maximising growth is not equivalent to maximising development. The impact of growth on poverty eradication could be much higher if inequality were reduced and human rights respected. Members insist, therefore, that EU development assistance must be geared towards pro-poor growth through the adoption of measures which specifically focus on the poor and the marginalized in order to foster an increase in their share of national wealth and allow them to become a driving force for genuinely inclusive growth, such as micro-credit and micro-finance, as well as other market-derived solutions. The resolution stresses that economic growth policies cannot succeed without promotion of social and environmental standards and the implementation of social protection mechanisms. Further measures are laid down: favour measures which provide security of land tenure and facilitate poor people’s access to land, markets, credits and other financial services and skills development; promote industrial development and the development of infrastructure ; limit the effects of greenhouse gas emissions; strengthen large-scale export and property rights; diversify the economies of developing countries and reducing their dependence on imports need to be priority objectives for policies supporting growth; Human development : Parliament emphasises that the provision of basic social services is crucial to pro-poor growth and reaching the MDGs. It calls for 20% of all EU assistance to be earmarked for basic social services. Members underline that girls’ education and the promotion of gender equality in education are vital to development, and that policies and actions that do not address gender disparities miss critical development opportunities. The resolution stresses the importance of bridging financing gaps in health systems resulting from priorities such as sexual and reproductive health suffering cuts, and emphasises the importance of investing in the fight against HIV/AIDS and other diseases. It reiterates its view that the EU must support partner countries in developing fair, transparent and effective tax systems to generate the revenues needed for social protection and pro-poor policies, and must at an international level continue to work for greater financial transparency and to ensure that partner countries share the benefits. Involving the private sector : Parliament recalls that 90% of jobs in developing countries are in the private sector. EU development aid should focus on financing for domestic companies, leveraging of domestic capitals and encouraging recipient countries to create an environment conducive to the development of small, medium-sized and micro-enterprises and on the removal of barriers to formalisation, access to capital and affordable credit and that services and capacity-building should be targeted in particular on poorer entrepreneurs. In this context, Parliament calls on the Commission to: promote and support, among other things, social-economy enterprises that work in accordance with ethical and economic principles; strengthen public investments in public goods, infrastructure and services; object to any kind of cooperation with private entities which would contribute directly or indirectly to any form of tax evasion or tax avoidance; favour investors that support the partner country’s development strategy, and to give preferential treatment to domestic and regional investors in order to promote regional integration; strengthen Public Private Partnerships (PPP), which involve the private sector in development; fight corruption, within both businesses and NGOs, as well as in governments and public authorities. Members call on the EU to meet its Aid for Trade Strategy commitments on development assistance specifically targeted at projects designed to help developing countries develop their trade-related skills, improve the supply chain and ultimately compete in regional and global markets. Climate change, energy and sustainable development : Parliament prioritises support for local and regional sustainable energy solutions, and decentralised energy production in particular, so as to bring development priorities in line with environmental concerns. It notes the huge potential for renewable energy (solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy and biomass) in many developing countries. Parliament reiterates that developed countries have a duty to take the lead in building the low-carbon global economy needed to achieve the necessary emission cuts. It encourages Member States to take the lead in cutting emissions. The resolution calls for a holistic approach which integrates the environmental dimension in development programmes and projects for example by improving regulations concerning waste transfer and illegal logging. T he Commission is called upon to assess the impact of ‘climate migration’, a phenomenon that some estimate will cause 200 million people to leave their homes by 2050 as conditions in their lands gradually worsen and emphasises that the European Union must contribute through its development policy to providing assistance and reducing the number of refugees, by investing in technologies, human resources and financial aid. Parliament reiterates its position that mainstreaming cannot replace the provision of new and additional resources which the EU and other donors have committed towards developing countries climate change mitigation efforts and adaptation needs. Food security and agriculture : Parliament reiterates its position that the EU should focus its development assistance on safeguarding the food security of developing countries and promoting sustainable, local, small-scale and organic agricultural production. It calls in particular for: a switch to organic and ecologically sustainable farming; specific support to women in agriculture; the root causes of food insecurity, including weak accountability for the right to food, food-price speculation and ‘land grabbing’ should be addressed. Members recall that, in order to feed a world population expected to surpass 9 billion in 2050, agricultural output will have to increase by 70% between now and then, using less land, less water and fewer pesticides. They note that global food security is a question of the utmost urgency for the European Union and calls for immediate and consistent action to ensure food security both for EU citizens and at the global level. The resolution underlines that tackling food insecurity means implementing many measures in diverse sectors, such as the management of local natural resources, the reinforcement of production and manufacturing, training, the structuring of professional organisations, the implementation of a safety net for the most vulnerable, the education on nutrition and also the diversification of rural jobs beyond agriculture to enhance the income of rural families, who are the first victims of hunger. Parliament expresses its deep concern about the current farmland acquisition by government-backed foreign investors, particularly in Africa, which risks undermining local food security and causing unforeseen and far-reaching social unrest if it is not properly handled. Transparency : lastly, in order to increase transparency and public acceptance of development projects funded fully or partially by the EU or the Member States, Parliament calls for creating an electronic data base that provides information on ODA."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Directive 2004/49/EC on railway safety). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the last decade, the EU railway market has witnessed profound changes, gradually introduced by three legislative ‘railway packages’ intended to open up the national markets and make railways more competitive and interoperable at the EU level, while maintaining high level of safety. However, the modal share of rail in intra-EU transport has remained modest. This is why the Commission has put forward the Fourth Railway Package in order to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail services by removing the remaining market obstacles. This proposal for a Directive, along with the proposal to recast Directive 2008/57/EC on interoperability, are part of this fourth package which focuses on the removal of remaining administrative and technical barriers by: establishing a common approach to safety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railway undertakings active across the EU; decreasing administrative costs, accelerating administrative procedures, as well as avoiding disguised discrimination, relying on the European Railways Agency. In order to pursue efforts to establish a single market for rail transport services, it is necessary to establish a common regulatory framework for railway safety. Member States have until now developed their safety rules and standards mainly on national lines. Differences in principles, approach and culture have made it difficult to break through the technical barriers and establish international transport operations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment. In order to support the Commission in the impact assessment process, an external consultant was tasked to prepare an impact assessment support study and to undertake a targeted consultation of stakeholders. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to amend the current regulatory framework with a view to: facilitating the creation and implementation of a single EU safety certificate, in accordance with the recommendation of the European Railways Agency. Access to the railway infrastructure would only be granted to railway undertakings holding a safety certificate. In this regard, the proposal introduces amendments designed to take into account the new role of the national safety agencies in the transition process towards a single safety certificate and the reallocation of responsibilities between them and the Agency. adapting the text to take into account developments in the rail market : the current trend of outsourcing activities or services is leading to the emergence of new actors subject to increasing economic and financial pressure, while internal control is decreasing. This may have consequences for safety, unless a new way of monitoring is established, through contractual or other arrangements, to ensure that risk control measures are duly implemented by all relevant actors. Other proposed changes include: adapting the scope and definitions to improve consistency with the Interoperability Directive; adapting the provision regarding national rules to take into account the evolution of the legal framework (adoption of technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs)), in accordance with the conclusions of the Task Force established for the purpose; clarifying the cooperation between the national investigation body and the judicial authorities in case of investigation following an accident. It should be noted that the fourth railway package also includes: (i) a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and (ii) a proposal amending Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a single European railway area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes requirements in relation to the exercise of certain shareholder rights attaching to voting shares in relation to general meetings of companies which have their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State. The financial crisis has revealed that shareholders in many cases supported managers' excessive short-term risk taking. Moreover, there is clear evidence that institutional investors and their asset managers do not sufficiently focus on the real (long-term) performance of companies, but often on share-price movements and the structure of capital market indexes, which leads to suboptimal return for the end beneficiaries of institutional investors and puts short-term pressure on companies. The past years have highlighted certain corporate governance shortcomings in European listed companies. These shortcomings relate to different actors: companies’ and their boards, shareholders (institutional investors and asset managers) and proxy advisors. Five main issues have been identified : insufficient engagement of institutional investors and asset managers; insufficient link between pay and performance of directors; lack of shareholder oversight on related party transactions; inadequate transparency of proxy advisors; difficult and costly exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors. Stakeholders were consulted on two Green Papers (""Corporate governance in financial institution"" and ""The EU corporate governance framework""). Based on these consultations and further analysis, the Commission's Action Plan: European company law and corporate governance - a modern legal framework for more engaged shareholders and sustainable companies provides the Commission’s roadmap in the area, based the two objectives of enhancing transparency and engaging shareholders. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a range of options, including no policy change, have been considered to address each of the presented problems. The preferred option is the following: 1) mandatory transparency of institutional investors and asset managers on their voting and engagement and certain aspects of asset management arrangements; 2) disclosure of the remuneration policy and individual remunerations, combined with a shareholder vote; 3) additional transparency and an independent opinion on more important related party transactions and submission of the most substantial transactions to shareholder approval; 4) binding disclosure requirements on the methodology and conflicts of interests of proxy advisors; 5) creating a framework to allow listed companies to identify their shareholders and requiring intermediaries to rapidly transmit information related to shareholders and to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights. CONTENT: the main objectives of the proposal are as follows: Improving engagement of institutional investors and asset managers : the proposal should increase the transparency of institutional investors and asset managers. They will be required to develop a policy on shareholder engagement, which should contribute to managing actual or potential conflicts of interests with regard to shareholder engagement. They should in principle disclose to the public their engagement policy, how it has been implemented and the results thereof. Where institutional investors or asset managers decide not to develop an engagement policy and/or decide not to disclose the implementation and results thereof, they shall give a clear and reasoned explanation as to why this is the case. Strengthening the link between pay and performance of directors : the proposal aims at creating more transparency on remuneration policy and the actual remuneration awarded to directors and creating a better link between pay and performance of directors by improving shareholder oversight of directors’ remuneration. Shareholders should have the right to approve the remuneration policy and to vote on the remuneration report. All benefits of directors in whatever form will be included in the remuneration policy and report. The proposal does not regulate the level of remuneration and leaves decisions on this to companies and their shareholders. Improving shareholder oversight on related party transactions : the proposal requires listed companies that related party transactions representing more than 5% of the companies’ assets or transactions which can have a significant impact on profits or turnover to submit these transactions to the approval of shareholders and may not unconditionally conclude it without their approval. For smaller related party transactions that represent more than 1% of their assets, listed companies shall publicly announce such transactions at the time of the conclusion of the transaction, and accompany the announcement by a report from an independent third party. In order to target only transactions that could be most disadvantageous for minority shareholders and to keep administrative burden limited Member States should be allowed to exclude transactions entered into between the company and members of its group that are fully owned by the listed company. Enhancing transparency of proxy advisors : the proposal will require proxy advisors to adopt and implement adequate measures to guarantee that their voting recommendations are accurate and reliable, based on a thorough analysis of all the information that is available to them and are not affected by any existing or potential conflict of interest or business relationship. Proxy advisors are required to publicly disclose certain key information related to the preparation of their voting recommendations. Facilitating the exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors : it is estimated that non-national shareholders hold some 44% of the shares in EU listed companies. The proposal requires Member States to ensure that intermediaries offer to listed companies the possibility to have their shareholders identified. Intermediaries should, on the request of such a company communicate without undue delay the name and contact details of the shareholders. The proposal also requires that intermediaries facilitate the exercise of the rights by the shareholder, including the right to participate and vote in general meetings and requires companies to confirm the votes cast in general meetings by or on behalf of shareholders."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely (1) viable food production; (2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and (3) balanced territorial development. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances. Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. The framework set out in the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 (MFF) proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two-pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30% of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: (1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and (2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation') ; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); Proposal for a Council Regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers . The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework. A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. The impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. LEGAL BASIS: the first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Single CMO regulation lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, with the aid scheme for the most deprived to be placed under a separate instrument. Dairy sector :the 2008-2009 dairy crisis showed the need to maintain an effective safety net mechanism as well as to streamline available tools. The discussions in the High Level Expert Group on Milk that followed also pointed to the need to improve the functioning of the food chain. The regulation thus aims to streamline, expand and simplify provisions on the basis of experience to date with public intervention, private storage, exceptional/emergency measures and aid to specific sectors as well as to facilitate cooperation through producer and interbranch organisations. Sectoral aids : certain sectoral aids are removed (e.g. skimmed milk, hops and silkworms). The milk quota system and the wine planting ban are set to expire under existing legislation which is thus left unchanged in this respect. Sugar quotas are set to expire by 30 September 2015. A single animal disease / loss of consumer confidence provision and a general market disturbance clause are provided with the latter expanded to cover all sectors in the current Single CMO. Producer organisations and their associations : the product coverage for recognition of producer organisations and their associations as well as interbranch organisations by Member States is expanded to all sectors in the current Single CMO. Support for the setting up of producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector is moved to rural development. Compulsory written contracts : the Regulation reflects the proposal already made for the milk sector that set out basic conditions if Member States make written contracts compulsory with a view to strengthening the bargaining power of milk producers in the food chain. It also reflects the proposal already made on marketing standards in the context of the quality package. From a simplification perspective, doing away with certain sectoral aids, the decoupling of the aid scheme in the silk worm sector, ending the sugar quota system and removing the requirements for registration of supply contracts and for attestation of equivalence in the hops sector will positively impact the burden on Member States and red tape for operators. It will no longer be necessary to maintain a capacity to implement the sectoral aid schemes and to allocate resources to control them. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of: EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. The total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Distribution of support among Member States : it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. Rural development aid : this is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Lastly, some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: it has been estimated that of the over 12 000 alien species that are found in the European environment, 10-15% have reproduced and spread, causing environmental, economic and social damage. Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the major, and growing, causes of biodiversity loss and species extinction. They can be vectors of diseases or directly cause health problems. They can damage infrastructure and recreational facilities, hamper forestry or cause agricultural losses, to mention but a few. IAS are estimated to cost the Union at least EUR 12 billion per year and damage costs are continuing to rise. The European Union currently lacks a comprehensive framework to address the threats posed by IAS . With the 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, the Union undertook to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020, in line with the international commitments adopted by the parties to the Convention for Biological Diversity in 2010 in Nagoya, Japan. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the baseline option (option 0), which would maintain the status quo, the following options were identified: Option 1 : Enhancing cooperation and supporting voluntary action. Option 2.1 : Basic legislative instrument. Option 2.2 : Basic legislative instrument + permits for release of IAS of Member State. Option 2.3 : Basic legislative instrument + a strict general ban on the release of alien species, unless found to be safe. Option 2.4 : Basic legislative instrument + an obligation for the rapid eradication of newly establishing IAS of Union concern : with this option, when it comes to rapid response, Member States would not have a choice, but rather an obligation to eradicate quickly any newly establishing IAS of Union concern and share information. Derogations are possible if approved by the Commission. Option 2.4 was retained and informs the present proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims to tackle the issues highlighted above by establishing a framework for action to prevent, minimise and mitigate the adverse impacts of IAS on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Furthermore, it will seek to limit social and economic damage. In practical terms, the proposal seeks to attain these objectives through measures addressing : (i) the intentional introduction of IAS into the Union and their intentional release into the environment; (ii) the unintentional introduction and release of IAS, the need to set up an early warning and rapid response system; (ii) the need to manage the IAS spread throughout the Union. The proposal: provides the tools for prioritising IAS of Union concern to enable Union resources to be prioritised on the basis of risk and scientific evidence; establishes the measures necessary to prevent the introduction into the Union and the introduction or release into the environment of IAS; sets out the tools to ensure that IAS of Union concern can be detected early in the environment and at the Union borders and describes the measures that are triggered when these IAS are detected; establishes the obligations necessary to tackle IAS of Union concern that are already present in the Union or new ones that have eluded the prevention measures and early detection measures and managed to spread widely. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary implication on the credit appropriations of an administrative nature is estimated at EUR 560 000 for the first seven years (2015-2021). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 10 October 2011, the Council adopted a decision authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part. Negotiations began in December 2011 and were successfully concluded with the initialling of the Agreement on 5 March 2015. Pending its entry into force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and Australia, are provisionally applied. The Agreement will contribute significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and Australia, a partnership which is based on common values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, international peace and security. The Agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, which constitute the basis for cooperation between the Parties. Note on legal basis: the Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of common foreign and security policy, common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. Article 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part. In light of the above, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207 TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The purpose of the Agreement is ‘to establish a strengthened Partnership between the Parties; to provide a framework to facilitate and promote cooperation across a broad range of areas of mutual interest; and to enhance cooperation to develop solutions to regional and global challenges’. The content of the Agreement covers three pillars: -political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora. The Agreement includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements signed by the EU; -cooperation on economic and trade matters, including economic policy dialogue, promoting trade and investment matters, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as : -sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of: -Institutional framework: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement includes a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements. Once in force, the Agreement will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU’s relations with Australia."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU (‘MiFID’) together with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (‘MiFIR’) was adopted in the wake of the financial crisis. MiFID and MiFIR, collectively referred to as MiFID II, covers securities markets, investment intermediaries and trading venues. The new framework reinforces and replaces the current MiFID framework (Directive 2004/39/EC). Member States need to transpose the Directive by 3 July 2016. Both MiFID and MiFIR are scheduled to apply as of 3 January 2017. During the legislative process, the very high level of complexity of the MiFID II package and the need for a significant number of implementing measures were recognised. To this end, a period of 30 months was foreseen between the adoption and the entry into application, instead of the usual 18-24 months. Despite this unusually long period, ESMA has made clear to the Commission that the technical implementing challenges are of such magnitude that essential data infrastructures will not be in place in time for 3 January 2017. This is a result of significant challenges in collecting the data that is necessary for the operation of the MiFID II rules. The absence of data has ramifications across multiple areas of MIFID II. As regards market regulation, it is clear that without the foundation of reference data (instrument ID) and the additional data infrastructures for transparency calculations and position reporting in place, it will not be possible to apply the majority of the market rules. In order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption, urgent action is therefore needed to adjust the date of entry into application for MiFID II CONTENT: the purpose of the draft proposal amending Directive 2014/65/EU is to extend the entry into application of both instruments that are comprised in the MIFID II package as a result of the technical implementation challenges met by the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), national competent authorities ('NCAs') and stakeholders. In order to enable ESMA, NCAs and stakeholders to complete the operational implementation, the Commission considered it appropriate to defer the date by which the Member States need to apply the measures transposing Directive 2014/65/EU and the date by which the repeal of Directive 2004/39/EC is to take effect by 12 months until 3 January 2018. Reports and reviews should be deferred accordingly. The Commission stated that an extension of one year should provide sufficient and reasonable time for ESMA, NCAs and operators to put in place the infrastructure for data collection, reporting and the transparency threshold calculations."
3107EP8,"""""Indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts""""",0.843,0.887,0.02,0.438,0.173,0.881,0.838,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a regulatory framework at Union level for indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts whilst ensuring a high level of consumer and investor protection. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the pricing of many financial instruments and financial contracts - such as interest rate swaps, and commercial and non-commercial contracts, such as mortgages - depends on the accuracy and integrity of benchmarks. An index is calculated using a formula or some other methodology on the basis of underlying values. When an index is used as a reference price for a financial instrument or contract it becomes a benchmark. Therefore, it is important to target all benchmarks that price a financial instrument or consumer contract or that measure the performance of investment funds. Cases of manipulation of interest rate benchmarks such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) and EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate), as well as allegations that energy, oil and foreign exchange benchmarks have been manipulated, have demonstrated that benchmarks whose setting processes share certain characteristics, such as being subject to conflicts of interest, the use of discretion and weak governance, may be vulnerable to manipulation. Failures in, or doubts about, the accuracy and integrity of indices used as benchmarks may undermine market confidence, cause losses to consumers and investors and distort the real economy. It is therefore necessary to ensure the accuracy, robustness and integrity of benchmarks and the benchmark setting process. In most Member States there is currently no regulation at national level on the production of benchmarks. The International Organisation Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently agreed principles on benchmarks which are to be implemented by its members. However these principles provide flexibility as to the scope and means of their implementation and in relation to certain terms. An EU initiative will help enhance the single market by creating a common framework for reliable and correctly used benchmarks across different Member States. This proposal supplements the proposed Regulation on Market Abuse (MAR) and the proposed Directive for a Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse (CSMAD) (MAR has been the subject of a political agreement by the European Parliament and the Council in June 2013) clarify that any manipulation of benchmarks is clearly and unequivocally illegal and subject to administrative or criminal sanctions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. The policy options encompassed options to: (i) limit incentives for manipulation, (ii) minimise discretion and ensure benchmarks are based on sufficient, reliable and representative data, (iii) ensure internal governance and controls address risks, (iv) ensure effective supervision of benchmarks and, (v) enhance transparency and investor protection. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to introduce a common framework to ensure the accuracy and integrity of indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts in the Union. The proposal has four main objectives that aim to improve the framework under which benchmarks are provided, contributed to and used: to improve the governance and controls over the benchmark process and in particular ensure that administrators avoid conflicts of interest, or at least manage them adequately; to improve the quality of the input data and methodologies used by benchmark administrators and in particular ensure that sufficient and accurate data is used in the determination of benchmarks. The administrator shall obtain the input data from a reliable and representative panel or sample of contributors so as to ensure that the resultant benchmark is reliable and representative of the market or economic reality that the benchmark is intended to measure (‘Representative contributors’); to ensure that contributors to benchmarks are subject to adequate controls , in particular to avoid conflicts of interest and that their contributions to benchmarks are subject to adequate controls. The integrity and accuracy of benchmarks depends on the integrity and accuracy of the input data provided by contributors. It is essential that the obligations of the contributors in respect of this input data are clearly specified, can be relied on and are consistent with the benchmark administrator’s controls and methodology. It is therefore necessary that the benchmark administrator produces a code of conduct to specify these requirements and that the contributors are bound by that code of conduct; to ensure adequate protection for consumers and investors using benchmarks by enhancing transparency, ensuring adequate rights of redress and ensuring suitability is assessed where necessary. In order for users of benchmarks to make appropriate choices of, and understand the risks of, benchmarks, they need to know what the benchmark measures and their vulnerabilities. Therefore the benchmark administrator should publish a statement specifying these elements as well as publish the input data used to determine the benchmark. The proposed Regulation applies to all published benchmarks that are used to reference a financial instrument traded or admitted to trading on a regulated venue, or a financial contract (such as mortgages) and benchmarks that measure the performance of an investment fund. The proposal exempts from its scope central banks that are members of the European System of Central Banks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to task allocated to ESMA. The new tasks will be carried out with the human resources available within the annual budgetary allocation procedure, in the light of budgetary constraints which are applicable to all EU bodies and in line with the financial programming for agencies. In summary, the main budgetary implications of the proposal are: DG MARKT staff : 1 AD staff member (full-time): the total estimated costs are € 0.141 M yearly. ESMA : Staff costs (two temporary agents): the total yearly costs of these 2 temporary agents would be of €0.326 M, towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (€ 0.130 M) and Member States 60% (€ 0.196 M) yearly. Operational and infrastructure costs : an initial expense of € 0.25 M is also estimated for ESMA, towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (€ 0.1 M) and Member States 60% (€ 0.15 M) in 2015. ESMA will also need to produce a report on the application of this Regulation by 1 January 2018 with a total cost of € 0.3 M towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (€ 0.12 M) and Member States 60% (€ 0.18 M) in 2017. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union and its Member States are Parties to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention). Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Aarhus Regulation) established provisions to apply the provisions of the Convention to EU institutions and bodies. For the European Green Deal to be successful and bring about lasting change, the public - individuals but also civil society - should remain a driving force in the transition and be given the means to participate actively in the development and implementation of new policies. In its Communication on the European Green Deal, the Commission committed itself to revise the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ to improve access to administrative and judicial review at EU level for citizens and NGOs who have concerns about the legality of decisions affecting the environment and to take measures to improve their access to justice before the national courts in all Member States. In its resolution of 15 January 2020, the European Parliament reaffirmed that it is essential to ensure that EU citizens have genuine access to justice and documents as enshrined in the Aarhus Convention. CONTENT: the proposal aims to revise the administrative review created established in 2006 by the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ for the benefit of NGOs with regard to acts and omissions of an administrative nature by EU institutions and bodies. In concrete terms, the amending proposal: - extends the current possibilities for NGOs to request administrative review: whereas administrative review can currently only be requested for acts of 'individual scope' (which directly concern a person), in future NGOs may also request review of any non-legislative administrative act of 'general scope'; however, the proposal excludes provisions of such acts for which EU law explicitly requires implementing measures at EU or national level; - amends the references to environmental law by providing that, in future, any administrative act which contravenes EU environmental law may be subject to review, irrespective of its policy objectives; however, the proposal does not envisage granting standing for individuals; - extends the deadlines for the internal review procedure to allow for an appropriate quality of submissions, including a two-week extension for NGOs and a four-week extension for EU institutions. Budgetary implications The report and the external study on the functioning of access to justice in environmental matters accompanying the proposal assessed the impact of the different options on the internal resources of the EU institutions, in particular the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). They concluded that this impact shall be limited if the options introduced by the proposal are followed. The proposed amendments shall not create a new system and shall not lead to an increase in the number of potential applicants for review. Although the expanding of the eligibility requirements may lead to an increase in the current workload, this could be partially compensated by clearer eligibility criteria."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: digital services cover a wide range of daily activities including online intermediation services, such as online marketplaces, online social networking services, online search engines, operating systems or software application stores. They increase consumer choice, improve efficiency and competitiveness of industry and can enhance civil participation in society. However, whereas over 10 000 online platforms operate in Europe’s digital economy, most of which are SMEs, a small number of large online platforms capture the biggest share of the overall value generated. These large platforms increasingly act as gateways or gatekeepers between business users and end users and enjoy an entrenched and durable position. The proposed Digital Markets Act aims at preventing gatekeepers from imposing unfair conditions on businesses and consumers and at ensuring the openness of important digital services. Common rules across the single market are needed to foster innovation, growth and competitiveness, and facilitate the scaling up of smaller platforms, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups who will have a single, clear framework at EU level. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the aim of the proposed regulation is to lay down harmonised rules ensuring contestable and fair markets in the digital sector across the EU where gatekeepers are present. It should apply to core platform services provided or offered by gatekeepers to business users established in the EU or end users established or located in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment or residence of the gatekeepers and irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the provision of service. Its main objectives are: - to address market failures to ensure contestable and competitive digital markets for increased innovation and consumer choice; - to address gatekeepers’ unfair conduct; - to enhance coherence and legal certainty to preserve the internal market. Specific provisions of the proposal The proposal: - should only apply to large companies that would be designated as ‘gatekeepers’. For this purpose, it contains the provisions concerning the designation of gatekeepers. More specifically, it establishes the conditions under which providers of core platform services should be designated as gatekeepers either based on the quantitative criteria (through a presumption subject to counter-demonstration) or following a case-by-case assessment during a market investigation; - sets out the practices of gatekeepers that limit contestability and that are unfair; - provides rules for carrying out market investigations: (i) designation of a gatekeeper; (ii) investigation of systematic non-compliance and (iii) investigation of new core platform services and new practices; - contains the provisions concerning the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation. These include the Commission's ability to request information, to conduct interviews and make statements and on-site inspections, to adopt interim measures and to make voluntary measures binding on the gate-keepers. In case of non-compliance, the Commission can issue non-compliance decisions, as well as impose fines and periodic penalty payments for breaches of the Regulation. Budgetary implications The total financial resources necessary for the implementation of the proposal in the 2021-2027 period should amount to EUR 81.090 million, including EUR 50.640 million of administrative costs and EUR 30.450 million entirely covered by the allocations foreseen in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 under the financial envelopes of the Single Market Programme and the Digital Europe Programme. The financing should support inter alia activities such as carrying out the designation of providers of core platform services, carrying out market investigations and performing any other investigative actions, enforcement actions and monitoring activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use provides for a harmonised framework on advertising of medicines at Community level, the application of which remains a responsibility of Member States. This legislation prohibits the advertising to the general public of medicines subject to prescription. However, neither the Directive nor Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 include detailed provisions on information on medicinal products, providing only that certain information supply activities are exempted from the advertising provisions. Therefore, Community legislation does not prevent Member States from establishing their own approaches regarding the provision of information on medicinal products as long as the above mentioned rules on advertising are respected. In addition, the boundaries between advertising and information, and therefore the field of application of the legislation's restrictions on advertising, are not interpreted consistently across the Community. Pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC, a Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council concerning the ""Report on current practices with regard to the provision of information to patients on medicinal products"" (see COD/1999/0134 under “Follow-up documents”) was adopted and submitted to the European Parliament and the Council on 20 December 2007. According to the Report, rules and practices on what information can be made available vary significantly among Member States. Moreover, divergences in terms of rules and practices on what information can be made available have a negative impact on legal certainty for marketing authorisation holders with cross-border activity. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (see also COD/2008/0255) to address the gap in the current pharmaceutical legislation as regards the provision of information to the general public on prescription-only medicinal product for human use. The aim is to enhance the rational use of these medicines, while ensuring that the legislative framework continues to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines. The main elements of the proposals can be summarised as follows: clarifying that the provision of information on prescription-only medicines directly to the public by marketing authorisation holders is allowed, without prejudice to the prohibition on advertising, provided that clearly defined conditions are fulfilled; establishing harmonised conditions on the content of information which marketing authorisation holders are allowed to disseminate (information approved by the competent authorities for granting marketing authorisation, whether used literally or presented in a different way, and other limited medicine-related information); establishing harmonised quality standards for such information, to ensure that it is of high-quality and non-promotional; determining the authorised channels of information provision, in order to exclude unsolicited means of dissemination; introducing the obligation for Member States to establish a monitoring system to ensure that the abovementioned provisions on content of information, quality standards and dissemination channels are complied with and ensure enforcement in case of non-compliance. The proposal leaves it up to the Member States to decide the most appropriate monitoring mechanisms, but lays down a general rule that monitoring should take place after dissemination of information, with certain exceptions (where prior approval would be necessary) in the case of certain modalities of information where the distinction between advertising and non-promotional information is more difficult to establish. For products authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, certain approval tasks are given to the European Medicines Agency; establishing specific monitoring rules for information disseminated through websites, to take account of the cross-border nature of information provided over the Internet and to allow Member State cooperation and avoid duplication of monitoring."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas took over the design adopted by the Schengen states and sets out in its recitals that these documents have to contain all the necessary information and meet very high technical standards, notably as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification. Since the introduction of the uniform format for visas, two substantial modifications to the initial Regulation have been adopted, which have contributed to the issuance of secure documents, fulfilling very high technical standards: the first amendment was introduced with Regulation (EC) No 334/2002 integrating a photograph produced according to high security standards as a first step towards the use of elements establishing a more reliable link between the visa sticker and the holder; the second amendment with Regulation (EC) No 856/2008 related primarily to an adaptation of the numbering in order to comply with the requirements of the Visa Information System (VIS). With the above mentioned modifications, high quality counterfeits have recently been detected in several Member States. It is therefore necessary to develop a new security concept with better security features for the visa sticker. The new common design should be established with more modern security features to render the visa sticker more secure and prevent forgery. For those reasons a physical document for the visa sticker will still be necessary for years to come. CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/951 laid down a uniform format for visas. The current visa sticker, which has been in circulation for 20 years, has to be considered as compromised in view of serious incidents of counterfeiting and fraud. Therefore, a new common model with more modern security features is proposed in order to render the visa sticker more secure and prevent forgery. The technical specifications for the production of the visa sticker are laid down in the new Annex to the amended Regulation. There are no substantive changes to the enacting term of this Regulation, only the Annex is replaced to show the image and the general description of the new visa sticker. The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation. Transition period : to allow for using up existing stocks, a transitional period of six months is foreseen within which Member States can still use the old visa stickers. Moreover, in relation to the current visa sticker, further improvement of the overall security is necessary, without increasing the costs for the document itself. Territorial provisions : specific measures are laid down in the proposal for the implementation of the proposal by Ireland and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 is part of the Schengen acquis to which Norway and Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein are associated on the basis of their respective Association Agreements, the proposed amendment should also apply to them."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa (ISF – Borders and Visa) for the period 2014-2020, as well as Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management which became applicable as of 1 January 2014. The purpose of the ISF – Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. It is thus a development of the Schengen acquis. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors. The aim of the draft Agreement with Switzerland (associated country) is to establish the arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approves the Agreement with Switzerland on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The negotiations were held jointly with all associated countries. Two rounds of negotiations took place. The final text of the draft Agreement with Switzerland was initialled on 21 April 2017. The draft Agreement provides for the amount of Switzerland's annual financial contribution to the budget of the ISF - Borders and Visa, calculated in accordance with its GDP as a percentage of the GDP of all States participating in the ISF. It specifies the annual payments. In addition, it foresees the modalities for the designation of the Responsible Authority and for the annual reporting system. The Agreement also contains provisions aiming to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities as well as to ensure compliance with the provisions relevant for the financial management and control which are laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') and in Union law based on the TFEU. This proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 92/66/EEC lays down the measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in poultry and certain birds. The Directive confers on the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, the power to amend the Directive’s Annexes. Thus, the Council may amend Annexes V, VI and VII to Directive 92/66/EEC which set out respectively (i) the indication of the European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle disease as well as its functions and duties, (ii) the model form to be used by Member States in order to report on the disease situation and the control measures applied; and (iii) the criteria to be applied by Member States for drawing up contingency plans specifying the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak the disease. It is necessary to simplify and streamline the procedures regarding the control of Newcastle disease, in particular taking into account the new rules in relation to the designation of European Union reference laboratories provided for by Article 93 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and also the new system of implementing acts provided for in Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The current European reference laboratory (EURL) for Newcastle disease is located in the United Kingdom. Hence, it needs to be replaced by an EURL located in one of the other 27 Member States in view of the United Kingdom exiting the EU. The current procedure for designating an EURL for Newcastle disease is via a Council Directive. This technical revision of the Directive 92/66/EEC will enable the use of the required implementing procedure to designate a new EURL for Newcastle disease within the tight deadlines related to BREXIT. CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to amend Council Directive 92/66/EEC in order to ensure consistency with the TFEU and the new provisions on official controls with a view to simplifying procedures. It aims to delete Annexes V, VI and VII of that Directive and to confer on the Commission implementing powers in the matters covered by those Annexes. These powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (comitology Regulation). The proposal provides that the Commission shall designate, by means of implementing acts, a European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle disease. For the sake of clarity, it sets out the function and duties of the European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle Disease as well as the criteria applicable to the contingency plans to be established by Member States in the event of the onset of the disease."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate individual Framework Agreements on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Negotiations with the Philippines started in February 2009 and were concluded in June 2010. Both sides initialled the PCA on 25 June 2010. The PCA was signed in Phnom Penh on 11 July 2012, on the occasion of the ASEAN Regional Forum ministerial meeting. The PCA with the Philippines is the first-ever bilateral agreement with the Philippines and supersedes the current legal framework of the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is now necessary to approve the Framework-Agreement on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: the Commission notes that Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA with the Philippines is the subject of Court Case C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul the above-mentioned Decision insofar as the Council had added the legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100 TFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4) TFEU). The Commission asked the Court to maintain the effects of the contested decision. Subject to the Court ruling in Case-377/12, this proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA is based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6). The Framework Agreement draws the attention of the Council to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of the UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The addition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on the outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice, this recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The Commission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure for conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised. CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Philippines, of the other part. General principles and political dialogue: the PCA with the Philippines marks an important step towards strengthening bilateral relations and the EU’s role in South-East Asia, based on shared universal values such as democracy and human rights. It paves the way for enhanced political, regional and global cooperation. Foreign policy: the PCA contains commitments which are central to the EU’s foreign policy, including provisions on: It also includes areas of current interest such as the peace process and disaster risk management. Economic and trade cooperation: the PCA considerably broadens the scope for mutual engagement in the economic and trade domain. It has an important trade cooperation section, which should facilitate free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. The conclusion of the PCA is in line with the EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and political framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries. Additionally, the PCA has an important development component, including strict provisions on protecting the EU’s financial interests. Sectoral cooperation: the PCA strengthens the sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, such as: Institutional Framework: the draft Agreement also includes institutional provisions to put in place a joint committee composed of representatives of the two Parties with the aim of ensuring the correct application of the Agreement and resolving conflicts."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: in the framework of the common fisheries policy established by Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, multi-annual plans should contribute to achieving fishing at sustainable levels (Maximum Sustainable Yield). The fisheries of the North Sea and adjacent areas are highly complex, involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, as well as Norway, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. The proposal presented by the Commission establishes a plan taking into account such mixed fisheries interactions. The Basic Regulation aims at solving the problems of overfishing and discarding fish. However, without additional legislation, the Basic Regulation could lead to under-utilisation of quota in the North Sea mixed fisheries and would not allow any exemptions from the landing obligation to be adopted after the three year discard plans have expired. Hence, if no appropriate measures are taken, the Basic Regulation might have negative economic and social consequences for the fishing industry in the coming years. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice (a single mixed fishery multi-annual plan for North Sea demersal fisheries), wherein FMSY (maximum rate of fishing mortality) is achieved by 2020 at the latest and stocks are rebuilt to within precautionary levels quickly is judged to be more effective than Option 1 (to manage using the Basic Regulation) to achieve the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP set out in Regulation 1380/2013. The plan will: ensure the sustainable exploitation of these stocks, by ensuring that they are exploited according to the principles of maximum sustainable yield and of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management; provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on stocks, mixed fisheries and other aspects of the ecosystem and environment; facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation. The proposal aims to replace the current plan for cod, as well as the plan for plaice and sole by bringing all multi-annual plans for the different demersal stocks into one regulation. The plan will apply to all Union fishing vessels irrespective to their overall length in fishing in the North Sea as this is in conformity with the rules of the CFP and is in line with the effect of the vessels on the fish stocks concerned. The proposed plan: requires the EU to set catch limits that restore and maintain fish stocks above levels that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); defines ranges within which catch limits can be set. Fishing opportunities in the higher part of the ranges will only be possible under clearly defined conditions and in line with the MSY approach; establishes safeguard measures for biomass based on the precautionary approach laid out in the Basic Regulation; obliges the EU to take swift action when the sustainability of any demersal North Sea fish stock is threatened; establishes the necessary framework for implementing regionalisation within the North Sea and provides for regional cooperation among Member States regarding the adoption of measures on the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for certain stocks; adopt thresholds above which catches of demersal stocks should only be landed in designated ports; does not include annual limits on fishing effort (the numbers of days at sea). There will be periodic evaluation (every five years) of the impact of the plan on the stock concerned based on scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the sustained financial and economic crisis is increasing the pressure on national financial resources as Member States are reducing their budgets. In this context ensuring a smooth implementation of cohesion policy programmes is of particular importance as a tool for injecting funds into the economy. Nonetheless, the implementation of the programmes requires significant amounts of funding from public and private stakeholders, who, due to the the liquidity problems faced by financial institutions are not able to provide such funding. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under a programme from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) for the EURO countries or from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism for non EURO countries. To date, six countries - including Greece which has received financial assistance outside the EFSM - have requested financial assistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission a macro-economic adjustment programme. These countries are Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. In order to alleviate those problems and to speed up the implementation of the operational programmes and projects, as well as to strengthen the economic recovery, it is appropriate that the managing authorities of the Member States having experienced serious difficulties with respect to financial stability and which have been granted financial assistance according to one of the financial assistance mechanisms set out above may contribute financial resources from operational programmes to the establishment of risk sharing instruments providing loans or guarantees or other financial facilities, in support of projects and operations foreseen under an operational programme. It should be noted that the Commission also adopted in August 2011 a proposal for an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 with a view to increase the amount of community contribution reimbursed through interim payments and payments of the final balance by up to 10 percentage points above the current limits. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to implement under indirect centralised management risk sharing instrument to cover risks related to loans and guarantees to be given to project promoters and other public or private partners. This will not impose additional financial requirements to the overall budget since the total financial allocation for the period from the Funds to the Member States in question will not change. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to risk sharing instruments for Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability with a view to: allow for risk sharing instrument to be managed under indirect centralised management; allow Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, to contribute part of their allocations under the ""Convergence"" and ""Regional competitiveness and employment"" objectives of cohesion policy to the provisioning and capital allocations to loans or guarantees issued to project promoters and other public or private partners directly or indirectly by the EIB or other international financial institutions. The terms and conditions applicable to such risk sharing instrument should be decided by the Commission, upon request from the Member State concerned. The Commission upon request of the Member States concerned should adopt ad hoc decisions to set the terms and conditions applicable to such instrument, on the basis of allocations to be transferred from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund allocations from the Member State concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. The Commission will in 2012 review the need for additional payment credits and if necessary propose the necessary actions to the Budgetary Authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its conclusions of 4 February 2011, the Council therefore invited Member States to inform from 1 January 2012 the Commission of all their new and existing bilateral energy agreements with third countries. The aim is to facilitate coordination at Union level and Member States' activities with a view to ensuring consistency and coherence in the EU’s external energy relations with key producer, transit, and consumer countries. Negotiations with powerful energy suppliers in third countries typically demand political support in the form of the conclusion of intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries. Following the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets in the European Union, in particular with the implementation of the Third Energy Package, the Member States have introduced significant changes in their energy legislation. Facing a possible supply shortage, Member States are under increasing pressure to accept regulatory concessions in their intergovernmental agreements with third countries which are incompatible with Union energy law. Such regulatory concessions threaten the operation and proper functioning of the Union internal market for energy. As was demonstrated during the gas dispute between the Russian Federation and Ukraine in January 2009, when the internal market is not functioning properly, the EU is more vulnerable to security of supply risks. Therefore it is important that the Member States and the Commission are aware of the amount and sources of energy imported. To address these problems, it is important to improve the exchange of information between Member States and between Member States and the Commission on existing, provisionally applied and future intergovernmental agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not considered it necessary to carry out a formal impact assessment. The Commission nevertheless evaluated a number of options to achieve the proper transposition of the European Council conclusions. A public consultation on the external dimension of the EU energy policy took place between 21 December 2010 and 7 March 2011. In total, over 90 replies were received. The responses received highlighted the important role of the Union in promoting a reliable legal and institutional framework in order to achieve mutually advantageous relations with its main energy suppliers and transit countries. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to transform the 4 February 2011 European Council conclusions into a mechanism with detailed procedures for the exchange of information between Member States and the Commission with regard to intergovernmental agreements in order to facilitate coordination at Union level to ensure security of supply, the proper operation and functioning of the Union internal energy market and create legal certainty for investment decisions. As the proposed exchange of information will increase the Member States' negotiating position vis-à-vis third countries, it will ensure the proper implementation of the Union rules and policies. Thus: it will allow taking the perspective of the collective security of supply situation in the EU, instead of a national perspective; the use of commonly developed standard clauses and the proposed compatibility check will furthermore provide investors with increased legal certainty as regards the likely compatibility of the intergovernmental agreement with EU legislation. Scope : Intergovernmental agreements are defined as all legally binding agreements between Member States and third countries which are likely to have an impact on the operation or the functioning of the internal market for energy or on the security of energy supply in the EU. To avoid duplication, intergovernmental agreements for which a specific notification to the Commission is already foreseen in other acts of Union legislation are excluded from the proposal, except intergovernmental agreements which must be submitted to the Commission according to the Security of Gas Supply Regulation.10 It is also proposed that the new mechanism shall not concern agreements between commercial operators except and only as far as the intergovernmental agreement explicitly refers to these commercial agreements. Exchange of information between Commission and Member States : Member States shall submit all existing and provisionally applied intergovernmental agreements between them and third countries in their entirety, including their annexes and other texts they refer to explicitly and all amendments thereto to the Commission at the latest three months after the entry into force of this Decision. When a Member State intends to enter into negotiations with a third country in order to amend an existing intergovernmental agreement or to conclude a new intergovernmental agreement, the Member State shall inform the Commission in writing of its intention at the earliest possible moment before the envisaged opening of the negotiations. Once the intergovernmental agreement is ratified, the ratified text shall be sent to the Commission . Intergovernmental agreements shall be submitted in their entirety, including their annexes, other texts they refer to and all amendments thereto. The Commission will make all information received available to the Member States via a database. When providing information to the Commission, a Member State may indicate whether any part of the information in the agreements submitted is to be regarded as confidential. Assistance from the Commission : the Commission shall also be informed as early as possible of their intention to open negotiations on future intergovernmental agreements or to amend existing intergovernmental agreements. The Commission shall be regularly informed on the negotiations. On request, the Commission shall participate as an observer to the negotiations. In this context, Member States also have the right to ask the Commission for assistance during their negotiations with third countries. Ex-ante compatibility control : the Commission may on its own initiative until four weeks after it has been informed of the closure of the negotiations at the latest or on request from the Member State which has negotiated the intergovernmental agreement, assess the compatibility of the negotiated agreement with Union law before the agreement has been signed. The Commission has an assessment period of four months. If such compatibility check has been requested, in the absence of an opinion of the Commission within this examination period, the Commission is deemed not to have raised any objections. Coordination : the Commission shall facilitate the coordination among Member States with a view to reviewing developments in relation to intergovernmental agreements, identifying common problems and solutions, and developing standard clauses that Member States can use in future intergovernmental agreements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the technical requirements for the type-approval of tractors with regard to numerous safety and environmental elements have been harmonised at the level of the Union in order to avoid requirements that differ from one Member State to another, to ensure a high level of road and occupational safety and environmental protection throughout the Community and to allow for a harmonized system of EU type-approval. The existing type-approval legislation for tractors is regulated in the following EU-acts: Council Directives 74/347/EEC, 76/432/EEC, 76/763/EEC, 77/537/EEC, 78/764/EEC, 80/720/EEC, 86/297/EEC, 86/298/EEC, 86/415/EEC, 87/402/EEC; European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/25/EC, 2003/37/EC, 2009/57/EC, 2009/58/EC, 2009/59/EC, 2009/60/EC, 2009/61/EC, 2009/63/EC, 2009/64/EC, 2009/66/EC, 2009/68/EC, 2009/75/EC, 2009/76/EC and 2009/144/EC. New technologies like ABS (anti-lock braking systems) are now available and can be implemented in the near future, which will dramatically improve vehicle safety. Research has indicated that there would be significant benefits if such technologies were introduced as standard on new vehicles. Setting common mandatory requirements would also prevent the fragmentation of the internal market resulting from varying product standards emerging across Member States. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : or each of the main aspects of the proposal, different options were considered: Simplification aspects – I: Directives or Regulations: a) no change in policy. This would mean that the existing 24 Directives would be maintained with additional amendments when necessary; b) replace existing separate Directives by one Regulation; c) replace existing Directives by one Regulation and a limited number of thematic delegated and implementing acts. This is the chosen option. Simplification aspect – II: all in detailed EU legislation or reference to international standards: a) no change in policy. This would mean that the existing 24 Directives would be maintained with additional amendments when necessary. The Directives would continue to operate in parallel with the existing UNECE Regulations and OECD Codes with the technical requirements usually (but not always) being the same. This is currently the cause of much confusion for stakeholders who are not closely involved with the type-approval system, and leads to a situation of a regulatory system that is less than fully transparent; b) replace existing separate Directives where possible by equivalent UNECE Regulations. c) Replace existing separate Directives where possible by equivalent UNECE Regulations, or OECD Codes (roll-over protection systems) or possibly CEN/CENELEC or ISO standards. This is the chosen option since it would maximise the advantages of simplification at the benefit, in particular, of national authorities and industry. Completion of the internal market a) no change in policy. This would mean that bit-by-bit the package as provided in Directive 2003/37/EC would be completed. b) complete the EU TA requirements and make EU WVTA mandatory for all categories; c) complete the EU TA requirements but leave EU WVTA optional for certain categories (T4, T5, C, R and S). LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal significantly simplifies the type-approval legislation by replacing 24 base Directives (and around 35 related amending Directives) in the field of agricultural and forestry vehicle technical requirements with one Regulation. It aims to lay down harmonised rules on the manufacture of agricultural and forestry vehicles (tractors, trailers and towed equipment) with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market while at the same time providing for a high level of road and occupational safety and environmental protection. This will also contribute to the competitiveness of the industry by simplifying the existing vehicle type-approval legislation, improving transparency and easing administrative burden. The draft regulation and its implementing and delegated acts will carry over the existing requirements laid down in the above acts. It will also lay down in detail the new mandatory requirements on braking. In particular, the delegated acts adopted under this proposal will require amongst others: mandatory fitting of anti-lock braking systems on some categories (T5 fast tractors and their trailers suitable for speeds over 40 km/h); compatibility between tractor and trailers/towed equipment. As far as the environmental aspects of the proposal are concerned, no changes are proposed to the existing levels of protection. The only change is that the Regulation should refer to Directive 97/68/EC on emissions of Non-Road Mobile Machinery instead of having a specific one for tractors, simplifying the current implementation process while keeping the key features for future developments. It should be noted that the proposal uses the “split-level approach” that was originally introduced at the request of the European Parliament and used in other pieces of legislation in the area of EU type approval of motor vehicles. 1) the fundamental provisions will be laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union through the ordinary legislative procedure; 2) the technical specifications implementing the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States of the one part and Ukraine, of the other part constitutes the basis of the relationship between the Union and Ukraine. Title IV on trade and trade-related matters is provisionally applied since 1 January 2016. In its preamble, the Parties to the Association Agreement have expressed their desire to strengthen and widen relations in an ambitious and innovative way. Taking account of the economic reform efforts undertaken by Ukraine, and in order to support the development of closer economic relations with the European Union, the measure aims at increasing the trade flows concerning the import of certain agricultural products and to grant concessions in the form of autonomous trade measures in selected industrial products in line with the acceleration of the elimination of customs duties on trade between the European Union and Ukraine. CONTENT: in order to increase the existing trade flows concerning the import of certain agricultural products from Ukraine into the Union, and to foster bilateral trade and economic cooperation with the Union, it is appropriate to grant additional autonomous trade preferences for Ukraine. The autonomous trade measures would be granted in the form of zero-tariff quotas for certain agricultural products in addition to the preferential tariff-rate quotas set out in the Agreement, and the partial or full removal of import duties on several industrial products. In order to increase the existing trade flows concerning the import of certain agricultural products from Ukraine into the Union, and to foster bilateral trade and economic cooperation with the Union, it is appropriate to grant additional autonomous trade preferences for Ukraine. The new autonomous measures would respect the same basic principles as those enshrined in the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine. Entitlement to benefit from the tariff-rate quotas shall be subject to: compliance with the rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto; abstention by Ukraine from introducing new duties or charges having equivalent effect and new quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect for imports originating in the Union or from increasing existing levels of duties or charges or from introducing any other restrictions from the day of the entry into force of this Regulation; respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law provided for in the Association Agreement. Normal safeguard procedures apply. The proposal confers implementing powers on the Commission enabling it to temporarily suspend the preferential arrangements established by this Regulation and to introduce corrective measures in cases where the Union market is affected by this Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Union will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to less than EUR 50 million annually with very limited impact on the EU’s own resources. The value of duties foregone on the importation of industrial products will count for approximately 20% of the total."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: Article 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""delegated acts"" (Article 290(3)). Article 291 of the TFEU allows Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""implementing acts"" (Article 291(4)). As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred upon the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 774/94 need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t here was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact analysis since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) 774/94 with the TFEU is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal consists in aligning Council Regulation (EC) No. 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty. Regulation (EC) No 774/94 confers powers on the Commission allowing it to adopt the necessary implementing measures. It also confers powers on the Commission to adopt adjustments to that Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular by a decision to approve an agreement with one or more third countries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 774/94, the relevant implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.

8957EP8,"""""Cross-border conversions, mergers and divisions""""",0.057,0.787,0.9,0.333,0.077,0.851,0.869,0.692,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to propose new company law rules to facilitate the conversions, mergers and divisions of companies within the Single Market. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: there are around 24 million companies in the EU, out of which approximately 80% are limited liability companies. Around 98-99% of limited liability companies are SMEs. The freedom of establishment plays a crucial role in the development of the Single Market as it allows corporate entities to pursue economic activities in other Member States on a stable basis. However, in practice the exercise of the freedom of establishment by companies remains difficult, in particular because company law is not sufficiently adapted to cross-border mobility in the EU. The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) has considered that the freedom of establishment enshrined in Article 49 TFEU entails the right, for companies established in a Member State, to transfer their seat to another Member State through a cross-border conversion without losing their legal personality. In particular in its recent judgement Polbud, the ECJ confirmed the right of companies to carry out cross-border conversions on the basis of the freedom of establishment. Currently, companies wishing to move their registered offices cross-border need to rely on Member States' laws. Such laws, where they exist, are often incompatible or difficult to combine with each other. Moreover, more than half of the Member States do not provide any specific rules allowing for cross-border conversions. SMEs are in particular negatively impacted since often they lack resources to perform cross-border procedures through costly and complicated alternative methods. This also means that the protection of stakeholders such as employees, creditors or minority shareholders is often ineffective or insufficient due to the lack of, overlapping or contradictory rules. Therefore, the Commission considers that the EU legislator needs to step in and provide for rules on cross-border conversion with adequate and proportionate safeguards for employees, creditors and shareholders to create a dynamic and fair Single Market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the chosen options consist in introducing: harmonised EU procedures to enable companies to carry-out direct cross-border conversions and divisions; harmonised rules throughout the single market to protect minority shareholders and creditors with the possibility for Member States to provide additional safeguards; targeted amendments to provide workers with the necessary protection, information, consultation and participation; rules and procedures whereby Member States would assess on a case-by-case basis whether the cross-border conversion constitutes an artificial arrangement designed to obtain undue tax advantages or to undermine the rights of employees, minority shareholders or creditors. According to the Commission, the new common rules on cross-border conversions and divisions would result in savings of between EUR 12 000 and EUR 37 000 (for divisions) and between EUR 12 000 and 19 000 (for conversions) depending on the size of the companies and Member States concerned. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies introduces a new European legal framework for cross-border divisions of companies and firms. The objective of this proposal is two-fold: provide specific and comprehensive procedures for cross-border conversions, divisions and mergers to foster cross-border mobility in the EU while, at the same time, offering company stakeholders adequate protection in order to safeguard the fairness of the Single Market. (1) Cross-border conversions : the proposal should allow companies to carry out a cross-border conversion by converting the legal form they have in one Member State into a similar legal form in another Member State. This process should ensure: (i) that companies retain their legal personality throughout the procedure, without being obliged to dissolve or wind up in the departure Member State, and (ii) that they constitute a new entity in the Member State of destination. A crucial element of the procedure is that it would prevent a cross-border conversion where it is determined that it constitutes an abuse, namely in cases where it constitutes an artificial arrangement aimed at obtaining undue tax advantages or at unduly prejudicing the legal or contractual rights of employees, creditors or minority members. The first step in the procedure would be the preparation of the draft terms of the cross-border conversion and two targeted reports addressed to shareholders and employees on the implications that the cross-border conversion will have. Thereafter, the company is to take a decision at the general meeting on whether to pursue the cross-border conversion. That decision, together with the relevant information and documents, would then be submitted to the competent national authority of the Member State of departure which is responsible to decide whether to issue a pre-conversion certificate or not. The authority would determine if all conditions for the cross-border conversion laid down in the Directive and in national law are fulfilled, including whether the company is solvent, the requisite majority of shareholders has approved the conversion at a general meeting and employees, minority shareholders and creditors are protected within the remit prescribed by the Directive. During this phase, the authority would also determine whether there is an artificial arrangement. If such an arrangement were to be established, the operation would be interrupted by the national authority of the Member State of departure even before the conversion may take place. The pre-conversion certificate shall be sent without delay to the competent authority of the Member State of destination which should examine the legality of the processing. Once the legality check has been carried out, a company would be registered in the register of a Member State of destination and deregistered in the register of a Member State of departure. The conversion shall then become legally effective. (2) Cross-border mergers : the proposal seeks to address the shortcomings in the existing texts by providing in particular for harmonised rules for the protection of creditors and shareholders. The company should provide, in the cross-border transformation project, the protection it intends to provide to creditors and shareholders. Creditors not satisfied with the protection offered could apply to the appropriate administrative or judicial authority for adequate safeguards. Shareholders who have not voted for cross-border mergers or do not have voting rights would have the right to leave the company (sell their shares) and receive adequate compensation. Furthermore, the proposed rules ensure that workers shall be informed of the implications that the proposed cross-border merger will have for workers. (3) Cross-border divisions : the proposal also simplifies the procedures allowing any capital company to carry out a cross-border division. The objectives of the harmonised rules on cross-border divisions remain similar to cross-border conversions: (i) enable companies to divide cross-border in an orderly, efficient and effective manner; (ii) protect the most affected stakeholders such as employees, creditors and shareholders in a suitable and proportionate manner. The procedure would ensure the scrutiny of legality of the cross-border division by the competent authority of the company being divided and by the authorities of the recipient companies in the light of all relevant facts and information. As in conversions, a crucial element of the procedure would be preventing a cross-border division where it is determined that it constitutes an abuse."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: road safety is one of the major elements of the European Union’s transport policy. In 2011 around 30 000 people were killed and more than 1.5 million injured in about 1.1 million traffic accidents on EU roads. In this context, eCall can significantly contribute to the reduction of road fatalities and alleviation of severity of road injuries. Therefore, the harmonised implementation of an interoperable EU-wide eCall service in the EU has been in the agenda of the Commission since 2005. Given the absence of any significant progress in the voluntary deployment of eCall by the end of 2009, the Commission decided to conduct an Impact Assessment in order to assess the most appropriate policy option to implement the EU-wide eCall service in Europe. The Commission unveiled on 8 September 2011 its strategy on regulatory measures for eCall, together with the adoption of the first part of this strategy, which consisted of a Commission Recommendation on support for an EU-wide eCall service in electronic communication networks for the transmission of in-vehicle emergency calls based on 112 (‘eCalls’). In its non-legislative resolution ‘report on eCall: a new 112 service for citizens’ adopted on 3 July 2012, the European Parliament stated that eCall should be a public EU-wide emergency call system, embedded in the vehicle and based on 112 and on common pan-European standards. It urged the Commission to submit a proposal within the framework of Directive 2007/46/EC in order to ensure the mandatory deployment of a public, 112-based eCall system by 2015 in all new type-approved cars and in all Member States’, On 26 November 2012, the Commission adopted the Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that the best option to implement eCall effectively is a ‘regulatory’ approach. eCall will then be based on the installation of type-approved equipment for the Single European Emergency Number 112 in all vehicles, starting with certain categories of vehicles, and a framework for handling eCalls in the telecommunication networks and PSAPs; the ability of mobile network operators to transmit messages in a certain format and, lastly, the capacity of the emergency call response centres (also known as PSAPs — Public Safety Answering Points) to handle these messages. The system can only be operational if all three parts are in operation simultaneously. The estimated costs of upgrading PSAPs average around EUR 1.1 million per Member State. reduction in fatalities (with all vehicles eCall-equipped, between 1% and 10% depending on country population density and road and emergency response infrastructure); reduction in the seriousness of the injuries (between 2% and 15%); reduction in congestion costs caused by traffic accidents; LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal addresses the part concerning the Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) infrastructure in the Commission strategy on eCall, based on a three-pronged regulatory approach encompassing the in-vehicle system, the telecommunications networks and the PSAPs. The current proposal calls on Member States to deploy the necessary eCall PSAP infrastructure required for the proper receipt and handling of all eCalls on their territory no later than 1 October 2015, in accordance with the specifications laid down by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to harmonised provision for an interoperable EU-wide eCall, in order to ensure the compatibility, interoperability and continuity of the EU-wide eCall service. Each Member State will be able to organise its emergency services in the way most cost effective and appropriate to its needs, including the possibility to filter calls that are not emergency calls and may not be handled by eCall PSAPs, in particular in the case of manually triggered eCalls. The Commission is proposing this piece of legislation in parallel to a proposed Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing in the EC motor vehicle type-approval system a requirement for fitting an eCall in-vehicle system.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 196) was signed by the Union on 22 October 2015, subject to its conclusion. Article 10 of the Protocol provides that the latter is open for the approval of the European Union. The Additional Protocol came into force on 1 July 2017. As of 11 July 2017, three EU Member States have ratified the Additional Protocol, and twenty-four EU Member States have signed it. The terrorist threat has grown and rapidly evolved in recent years. Foreign terrorist fighters have been linked to recent attacks and plots in several Member States. In addition, the Union and its Member States face increased threats from individuals who are inspired or instructed by terrorist groups abroad. In view of the continuing threat of terrorism to fundamental rights and the global nature of terrorism, the European Union must act united to promote and defend the principles of democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The Union has already adopted measures in the area covered by the Additional Protocol, including substantive criminal law provisions as well as a provision on enhanced information exchange. With the adoption of the directive on the fight against terrorism, the European Union is ready to complete its commitment to be a party to the Additional Protocol by conclusion of that instrument. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the decision to conclude the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 217). The present proposal is therefore accompanied by, and must be read together with, a proposal concerning a decision to conclude Convention No. 196 on behalf of the Union. Objectives of the Additional Protocol: the Protocol defines criminal offences related to terrorism, an area for which the Union has jurisdiction under Article 83(1) TFEU. It covers fields to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, namely the setting of minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in the area of terrorism (Article 83(1) TFEU) where consent by the European Parliament is required. The Additional Protocol supplements Convention No. 196 with a series of provisions aimed at implementing the criminal law aspects of UN Security Council Resolution 2178(2014) on “Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts”. It seeks to prevent and curb the flow of foreign terrorist fighters to conflict zones and provide a common understanding of and response to foreign terrorist fighter-related offences, which serves as a benchmark for information exchange and facilitates cross-border investigations and prosecutions of acts of a preparatory nature having the potential and danger of leading to the commission of terrorist offences. The Additional Protocol thus provides for the criminalisation of the following acts: Contact point: the Additional Protocol requires the parties to designate a contact point for the 24/7 exchange of information on foreign terrorist fighters. It is proposed to designate Europol as this contact point, under the conditions stipulated in Regulation (EU) 2016/794 on relations with partners and the transfer and exchange of personal data. Territorial application: the Additional Protocol signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark. It is binding upon and applies in the United Kingdom only insofar as this Member State notifies the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument. Ireland is bound by Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and is therefore to take part in the adoption of this Decision."
6782EP7,"""""Pressure equipment""""",0.895,0.828,0.93,0.484,0.303,0.783,0.8,0.914,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to recast Directive 97/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 97/23/EC is an example of that Union harmonisation legislation, ensuring the free movement of pressure equipment. It sets out essential safety requirements that pressure equipment and assemblies must comply with in order to be made available on the EU market. (1) Experience with the enforcement of the legislation has shown that measures taken at national level have led to divergent approaches and to a different treatment of economic operators inside the EU, which undermines the objective of this directive. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the ‘New Legislative Framework’ was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). In view of ensuring consistency across Union harmonisation legislation for industrial products, it is necessary to align Directive 97/23/EC to the provisions of the NLF Decision. The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF implementation package adopted on 21 November 2011. (2) Directive 97/23/EC provides for a classification of pressure equipment in categories, according to the ascending level of risk due to pressure. This includes the classification of the fluid contained in the pressure equipment as dangerous or not, according to Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. On 1 June 2015 Directive, 67/548/EEC is to be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, which implements in the Union the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals that has been adopted at international level, within the United Nations (UN) structure. Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 introduces new hazard classes and categories only partially corresponding to those provided for by Directive 67/548/EEC. Directive 97/23/EC should therefore be aligned to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 while maintaining the existing levels of protection of that Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Alignment to the New Legislative Framework Decision : three options were examined and compared: Option 1 - no changes to the current situation; Option 2 - alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 - alignment to the NLF Decision by legislative measures. This option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into Directive 97/23/EC. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option. Alignment to the CLP Regulation : the impact assessment study concluded that the impact of the proposed alignment would be limited and in particular that the overall economic impact will be low. Based on the number of substances that would be subject to a different classification and the proportion of manufacturers that would be affected, the impact assessment study estimates the overall costs of aligning Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation to be of the order of EUR 8.5 million per year. The cost is due to the changes in the alignment for the health hazard classes. However, looking at the current compliance costs, and according to the impact assessment study, the total average cost of the conformity assessment for the pressure equipment covered by Directive 97/23/EC is estimated at EUR 236.3 million per year. Therefore, the incremental cost due to the alignment of Directive 97/23/EC to the CLP Regulation is low compared to the total cost for conformity assessment. However, the implementation of the CLP Regulation in the Union is mandatory and the cost cannot be avoided. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal intends to align Directive 97/23/EC on pressure equipment to: the ‘goods package’ adopted in 2008 and in particular to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products; Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures. The changes made to the provisions of Directive 97/23/EC concern: the definitions, the obligations of economic operators, the presumption of conformity provided by harmonised standards, the declaration of conformity, CE marking, conformity assessment bodies, the safeguard clause procedure, the conformity assessment procedures and the classification of the fluids. The proposal includes: measures to address the problem of non-compliance by clarifying the obligations of economic operators and requiring enhanced traceability requirements; measures intended to ensure the quality of work done by conformity assessment bodies by reinforcing the notification requirements, revised notification process, specifying requirements for notifying authorities and more stringent information obligations; measures intended to ensure greater consistency amongst Directives by aligning commonly used definitions and terminology and aligning the conformity assessment procedures. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

The Commission found Samoa's offer acceptable and concluded negotiations with Samoa on 23 April 2018. Samoa's accession should now be approved on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission invites the Council to approve, on behalf of the Union, Samoa's accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part. The EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement, which offers asymmetric market access to Samoa and allows it to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation, while providing a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection. It further contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate Samoa's exports into the EU. Over the course of its implementation, the EPA will largely relieve EU exporters of industrial products to Samoa from paying customs duties. It satisfies the criteria established in Article XXIV of the GATT 1994 (to eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce with respect to substantially all trade between the parties) i.e.: 80 % of EU exports are covered in 15 years. Samoa will benefit from maintaining their duty-free quota-free market access into the EU market. The EPA also establishes a set of disciplines in the areas of sustainable development; technical barriers to trade; and Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures among others. There is a possibility for the EU to avail itself of the bilateral dispute settlement mechanism foreseen under the Agreement. Samoa graduated from the Least Developed Countries category in 2014; as such it continues to benefit from the 'Everything But Arms' initiative which offers its exports duty-free quotafree market access into the EU for a transitional period ending on 31 December 2018. As of then, the standard form of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) will apply to Samoa's exports to the EU, which is however less generous than the EBA. To maintain full duty-free-quota-free access to the EU market, Samoa would need to have joined the existing EPA between the EU, Fiji and PNG as of 1 January 2019. It is therefore foreseen that the EU and Samoa shall provisionally apply the Agreement subject to notifying each other in writing of the completion of the procedures necessary for this purpose in accordance with Article 76(3) of the Agreement. The scope of the agreement does not cover tax good governance. The Commission will use the context of the EPA Committee meeting to raise with the Samoan authorities their situation towards the EU list, in particular to advocate for tax reforms in line with the EU listing criteria. The proposal provides that the approval of the accession must not be construed as conferring rights or imposing obligations which can be directly invoked before Union or Member State courts or tribunals."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Dominica and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 11 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andDominica on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Dominica when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Dominica to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Dominica may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Dominica remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Dominica reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Dominica to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. BACKGROUND: office equipment will account for a growing share of energy consumption in future as new applications and functionalities appear. In order to meet the Union target for a 20% reduction in primary energy consumption by 2020 relative to projections, as endorsed at the Spring 2007 European Council, the energy performance of office equipment has to be further optimised. Regulation (EC) No 106/2008 sets out the rules for implementing the Energy Star programme for office equipment (computers, displays, printers, copiers, scanners, etc.) in the European Union. The Energy Star programme is implemented in the EU on the basis of an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Community on the coordination of energy efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment, which expired in December 2011. On 12 July 2011 the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a new 5-year agreement and the negotiations were concluded on 29 November 2011. It is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) 106/2008 to adapt the implementation of the Energy Star programme to the new agreement. A proposal for a Council Decision for the signature and conclusion of the new Energy Star Agreement is presented to the Council with this proposal for an amendment of Regulation (EC) 106/2008. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal takes into account the experience gained during the first two periods of implementation of the Energy Star Programme in the EU from 2001 to 2010, as well as the consultations with the European Union Energy Star Board. The detailed rationale for concluding a new Agreement continuing the Energy Star Programme for a third period of five years is set out in the Recommendation from the Commission to the Council to open negotiations for the third Energy Star Agreement and in the Communication on the implementation of the Energy Star Programme in the period 2006-2010. The main points are as follows : · Energy Star has been very effective in steering the office equipment market towards greater energy efficiency. It has succeeded in reducing the electricity consumption of office equipment sold in the last 3 years by around 11 TWh, i.e. by approximately 16 %. As a result, more than EUR 1.8 billion have been saved on energy bills and 3.7 Mt of CO2 emissions have been avoided. · It provides a flexible and dynamic policy framework which is particularly well suited to fast-evolving products such as ICT (information and communication technology). · The EU and the US should continue to cooperate on developing product specifications, so that the same level of requirements can be introduced at approximately the same time by both entities. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(1) TFEU. CONTENT: the primary purpose of this proposal for an amendment of Regulation (EC) 106/2008 is to adapt the implementation of the Energy Star Programme to the new Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Union on the coordination of energy-efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment. The only substantive amendment to the proposal is the deletion of Article 4(4) of Regulation 106/2008, which states that office equipment products for which use of the Common Logo has been granted by USEPA shall be deemed to comply with the Regulation, unless there is evidence to the contrary. Until now, the programme in the EU and the US has operated on the basis of self-certification by manufacturers. The success of the programme in the EU is considered to be partly based on such lightweight product registration procedures. However, the US has decided to move to third-party certification for products placed on the US market. Such an approach is not recommended for the EU market. It could have a negative impact on the programme and place SMEs at a disadvantage in relation to big manufacturers Thus under the new agreement the programme will have to function under two separate product registration systems: products placed on the EU market will need to be registered with the European Commission, while products placed on the US market will need to register through third parties accredited under the US Energy Star Programme. This means that the principle of mutual recognition will no longer be applicable. Other amendments aim at updating the references to existing legislation and to the new agreement, as well as updating the name of the Energy Star Board, and providing a clarification of the responsibilities of the Commission and Member States for the enforcement of the Programme. The strengthening of public procurement provisions will be covered by the proposal for an Energy Efficiency Directive which addresses public procurement in a comprehensive way. The amended Regulation should take into account the provisions on public procurement in this Directive. The Commission will continuously monitor the impact of the changes proposed by the US and of the Energy Star Programme on energy savings, manufacturers and compliance. At least two years before the expiry of a new Agreement, it will analyse possible future options for addressing the energy consumption of office equipment, including replacing Energy Star with alternative policy instruments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal aims at continuing the implementation of an existing programme and therefore has no impact on operational and administrative appropriations and on human resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and India was signed in New Delhi on 23 November 2001. This Agreement stipulates that it shall be concluded for an initial period of five years and may be renewed by mutual agreement between the Parties after evaluation during the last year of each successive period. By its Decision 2009/501/EC of 19 January 2009, the Council approved the renewal of the Agreement for a further period of five years, until 17 May 2015.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (repealing Directive 2006/87/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes harmonised conditions for issuing technical certificates for inland waterway vessels throughout the Union's inland waterway network. The technical requirements for vessels navigating on the Rhine river are established by the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR). The technical requirements set out in the annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC for the most part incorporate the provisions laid down in the Rhine Vessels Inspection Regulations, in the version approved in 2004 by the CCNR. The conditions and technical requirements for issuing inland navigation certificates under Article 22 of the Revised Convention on the Navigation on the Rhine are updated regularly and are recognised as reflecting current technological developments. Maintaining two different set of rules , those for certificates issued pursuant to Article 22 of the Revised Convention on the Navigation on the Rhine and for the Union inland navigation certificate, does not ensure legal certainty and safety. In order to achieve harmonisation at Union level and to prevent distortions of competition and varying levels of safety, it is necessary that the same technical requirements for the whole of the Union's inland waterway network should be applied and updated regularly. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The interested parties generally welcomed the overall approach to revising governance in order to streamline updates of the technical standards for inland navigation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to adopt a uniform set of technical standards for inland navigation vessels. This would provide: (i) more legal certainty; (ii) ensure that technical adaptations to technical progress can be introduced within a reasonable time; (iii) ensure that high safety standards on all EU inland waterways are maintained; (v) promote innovation in the sector. In the context of Directive 2006/87/EC, the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels are laid down in annex II. The proposed Directive re-organises the content of the annexes so as to ensure that these only cover aspects of a technical or a procedural nature. Aspects referring to the decision-making mechanism are integrated into the main text of the Directive. This concerns mainly the following provisions: Equivalences and derogations : in order to accommodate alternative approaches, to promote innovation, to prevent unreasonable costs, to provide for an efficient process for issuing certificates or to take account of regional circumstances, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the authorisation of certain derogations to the technical requirements for specific craft, to approve classification societies and to approve additional or reduced technical requirements for vessels operating in certain zones which are not linked to the navigable inland waterways of another Member State. These powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Adaptation of the Annexes : the approach taken in this proposal is to delegate powers to the Commission in respect of adapting the annexes of this directive in light of scientific and technical progress or of developments in this area arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular that of the CCNR. In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts for adapting the annexes, including for modifying the models of documents set out in the annexes to this Directive and adopting or modifying administrative instructions. When adopting such delegated acts the Commission shall ensure that the technical requirements that have to be fulfilled for the issuance of the Union inland navigation certificate recognised for navigation on the Rhine comply with a level of safety equivalent to that required for the issuing of the certificate referred to in Article 22 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation. Technical inspections : the Union inland navigation certificate should be issued to a craft that passes a technical inspection carried out prior to the craft being put into service. This technical inspection should be used to check whether the craft complies with the technical requirements set out in this Directive. The competent authorities of the Member States should be entitled to carry out additional inspections at any time to verify that the craft's physical state matches the Union inland navigation certificates. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal h as no implication for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by concessionnaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. Considering the special position of the Channel Fixed Link as a railway link involving a single, complex engineering structure situated partly in the territory of France and of a third country respectively, it is appropriate to authorise France to enter into an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link in order to maintain a unified safety regime in the whole Tunnel, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. To this end, a proposal for a Regulation amending Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety is also being presented in parallel by the Commission. CONTENT: following a request submitted by France on 16 July 2020, this proposal aims to authorise France to negotiate an international agreement supplementing the Treaty of Canterbury with the United Kingdom to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link by maintaining a single safety authority responsible for the whole infrastructure, and to define the specific requirements that the proposed agreement must meet, such as the obligation for the Intergovernmental Commission to apply EU rules on railway safety and interoperability. The Intergovernmental Commission established by the Treaty of Canterbury shall therefore remain the single safety authority and shall continue to apply Union rules on railway safety. The aim is to ensure that the Intergovernmental Commission applies Union law on the whole of the Channel Fixed Link, including in its section under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. In accordance with the Treaty of Canterbury, disputes between France and the United Kingdom concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaty of Canterbury shall be settled by an arbitration tribunal. Where such disputes raise questions relating to the interpretation of Union law, the arbitral tribunal should, in order to ensure the correct application of Union law, refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and defer to its decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative complements the Commission's proposal of 13 March 2020 for specific measures to mobilise investment in Member States' healthcare systems and other sectors of their economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative), as well as all other measures to address the current unprecedented situation. In view of the deep and worsening negative impact on EU economies and societies, the Commission considers it necessary to grant Member States exceptional additional flexibility to enable them to respond to this crisis by strengthening the possibility to mobilise all unused aid from the Funds. The proposal follows extensive consultations with Member States and the European Parliament in recent weeks and takes into account the more than 200 questions of clarification and advice received from national authorities on their handling of crisis response measures through the Coronavirus Investment Initiative Task Force. CONTENT: the proposal aims to introduce extraordinary flexibility to allow maximum mobilization of all unused aid from the European Structural and Investment Funds. This flexibility would be provided by: - the possibility of temporarily granting, for the implementation of cohesion policy programmes for the financial year 2020-2021, a 100% co-financing rate from the EU budget; - additional transfer possibilities between the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund, as well as between categories of regions; -the introduction of some flexibility in terms of thematic concentration, to allow Member States to redirect resources to the areas most affected by the current crisis; - the relaxation of certain obligations for Member States, where these entail an administrative burden that could delay the implementation of measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic; - the simplification of procedural requirements related to audits and financial instruments; - the possibilities for the support for working capital through financial instruments should be extended to the EAFRD. Lastly, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 to allow for ERDF support to be provided for undertakings in difficulties in these specific circumstances, thus ensuring consistency with the approach taken under the Temporary Framework for State Aid Measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak and with rules for the granting of de minimis aid. These exceptional amendments are without prejudice to the rules that should apply in normal circumstances."
5233EP7,"""""Action programme for customs""""",0.684,0.813,0.772,0.484,0.455,0.795,0.836,0.6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish an action programme for customs in the EU for the period 2014-2020 (Customs 2020). LEGISLATIVE ACT: amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020, proposing among other things, a new Customs programme. The customs union implies the management of large trade volumes on a daily basis – handling 7 customs declarations every second - requiring customs to strike a balance between the facilitation of trade for business and the protection of citizens against risks to their safety and security. This can only be achieved through intense operational cooperation between customs administrations of the Member States, between them and other authorities, with trade and other third parties. From an economic point of view, action at EU level is much more efficient. The backbone of the customs cooperation is a highly secured dedicated communication network. It interconnects national customs administrations in approximately 5 000 connection points. If such an infrastructure were not available, Member States would have to link 26 times to the national systems of each of the other Member States. The proposed programme is the successor programme of the Customs 2013 programme which ends on 31 December 2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: considering the overall policy context and problems ahead for customs in the next decade, a number of policy options has been analysed and compared: Option 1: baseline: continuing the programme with the current objectives and design. Option 2: no continuation of the programme. Option 3: increased support to EU legal obligations such as the Modernised Customs Code (MCC): this policy option would extend the baseline scenario tailoring the programme to the new needs deriving from the evolving customs union environment, including the Union Customs Code (UCC) . Option 4: increased support to EU legal obligations and financial support for technical capacity building: besides the components in the previous option, this option would include a financial support scheme allowing Member States to request support to acquire equipment to control borders-for instance scanners or laboratory equipment. Option 5: increased support to EU legal obligations with a maximised shared IT environment. The impact assessment identified Option 3 as the preferred option as it scores best on acceptability by Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Article 33 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Regulation proposes to establish a multi-annual action programme ""Customs 2020"" to support the functioning of the customs union, and covering the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Scope: the programme will support customs cooperation in the Union clustered around human networking and competency building, on the one hand, and IT capacity building on the other hand. The first cluster allows for the exchange of good practices and operational knowledge amongst the Member States and incidentally other countries participating in the programme. The latter enables the programme to fund appropriate IT infrastructure and systems that allow customs administrations in the Union to evolve to fully-fledged e-administrations. The programme will be open to participation by Member States, candidate countries and potential candidates. Countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy will also have the option of taking part in the programme under certain conditions. External experts may also participate in specific actions (e.g. representatives of other authorities, trade, national and international organisations, and possibly other experts), if required to realise the programme objectives. Objectives: these address the problems identified and challenges expected for customs in the next decade. The specific objective of the programme shall be to support the functioning of the customs union, in particular through cooperation between participating countries, their customs authorities, other competent authorities, their officials and external experts. The programme will have the following priorities: to support the preparation, coherent application and effective implementation of Union law; to strengthen the competitiveness of European businesses through the facilitation of legitimate trade, the reduction of compliance costs and administrative burden, and the protection against unfair competition; to support customs in protecting citizens, safety and security and the environment; to ensure the protection of the financial and economic interests of the EU and Member States; to contribute to the efficient functioning of customs authorities by improving their administrative capacity; to fight fraud and to enhance competitiveness, safety and security through cooperation with international organisations, third countries, other governmental authorities, economic operators and their organisations. The main added value of the programme is generated by enhancing the capacity of Member States to raise revenue and managing increasingly complex trade flows, while cutting costs in developing the tools for these purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the timing of the review of EU funding programmes is linked to the proposal for a new Multiannual Financial Framework . In accordance with that proposal, this Regulation on the Customs 2020 programme contains a budgetary framework of EUR 548 080 000 (in current prices) for the period of 2014-2020. The Customs 2020 programme will be implemented by means of a direct central management mode and in a priority-based manner. Work programmes are established –together with the stakeholders- stipulating the priorities for a specific period."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The objectives of the CFP are, inter alia, to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally sustainable in the long term, to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and to implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. For the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, a number of conservation measures are to be adopted as appropriate in any combination thereof, such as multi-annual plans, technical measures, fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities. The fisheries of the Western Waters and adjacent areas are highly complex , involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. Council Regulations (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) 509/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008 and (EC) No 1342/2008 set out the rules for the exploitation of the northern stock of hake, hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and by the Western Iberian Peninsula, sole in the Bay of Biscay, sole in the Western Channel, herring in the West of Scotland and cod in the Kattegat, the North Sea in the West of Scotland and the Irish Sea. These and other demersal stocks are taken in mixed fisheries. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a single multi-annual plan taking into account such technical interactions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three legislative options examined, a single multi-annual plan for mixed fisheries covering all Western Waters has been chosen. This option received the highest scores on the following criteria: (i) effectiveness and efficiency; (ii) reduction of administrative burden; (iii) achievement of the overall main objectives of the CFP; (iv) providing a management framework that promotes stability and predictability. CONTENT: in accordance with the overall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources and with specific regards to the Basic Regulation which require the development of multi-annual plans, the main elements of the plan are: Scope : the scope of the plan is demersal stocks, including deep-sea stocks, in the Western Waters and the fisheries exploiting those stocks. The plan also covers implementation of the landing obligation and technical measures for all stocks and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in the Western Waters. Objectives : the plan shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, in particular by applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and shall aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The plan shall contribute to: (i) the elimination of discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and to the implementation of the landing obligation for the species which are subject to catch limits and to which this Regulation applies; (ii) implementing the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in order to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised. Targets : objectives and targets should be quantifiable. The proposed targets are expressed as fishing mortality ranges around FMSY as advised by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). These FMSY ranges allow for a maximum sustainable yield-based management for the stocks concerned, and appear to allow for adaptations in case of changes in the scientific advice, while at the same time preserving a high level of predictability. Safeguard measures : safeguards and specific conservation measures are linked to the conservation reference points. Appropriate safeguard measures should be envisaged in case the stock size falls below these levels. Safeguard measures should include the reduction of fishing opportunities and specific conservation measures when scientific advice states that remedial measures are needed. The plan provides for the periodic assessment of the impact on the stocks concerned, on the basis of scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Member States have had positive experiences with repayable assistance schemes at the level of operations during the programming period 2000-2006 and have therefore continued such schemes or have started to implement repayable assistance schemes in the current programming period 2007-2013. Some Member States have also included descriptions of those schemes in their programming documents, which were approved by the Commission. Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund set out financial engineering instruments with precise areas and scope of intervention. However, the schemes implemented by Member States in the form of reimbursable grants and of credit lines managed by managing authorities via intermediate bodies are neither appropriately covered by the provisions on financial engineering instruments, nor by other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. It is therefore necessary to set out in a new Section of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 that the Structural Funds may co-finance repayable assistance. That Section should cover reimbursable grants and credit lines managed by the managing authority through intermediate bodies which are public financial institutions. IMPACT ANALYSIS: t he present proposal will clarify the use of repayable forms of assistance at project level, a practice which has been well established in the programming period 2000-2006 and will give the use of structural funds a further boost and higher leverage. The proposal aims to provide clarity about the legality of an existing legal practice. The main expected impact is thus the reduction of legal risk. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he proposal seeks to provide legal security at the level of European Union that support provided by Member States through Structural Funds to schemes based on repayable forms of assistance implemented lawfully in the previous programming period and/or started in the current period but not having the characteristics of financial engineering instruments are permitted and legitimate under the present Structural Fund regulations. The proposed modifications to the current regulatory framework are as follows: provides for a definition of reimbursable grant as a direct financial contributions by way of donation which can be totally or partially reimbursable without interest; establish that the Structural Funds may finance expenditure in respect of an operation comprising contributions to support repayable assistance. This provision covers reimbursable grants and credit lines managed by the managing authority through intermediate bodies which are ""in-house"" public financial institutions; clarify that the assistance repaid, to the body providing the assistance or to another competent public authority of the Member State shall be kept in a separate account and reused to the same purpose or in line with the objectives of the operational programme; clarify that provisions regarding major projects, revenue generating projects and durability of operations shall not, as a matter of principle, apply to financial engineering instruments under, since these rules are rather conceived for other types of assistance; introduce reporting of financial engineering instruments, having regard to the need to ensure appropriate monitoring, by the Member States as well as by the Commission, of the implementation of financial engineering instruments; introduce a legal obligation in order to ensure that the financial contribution paid by managing authorities for establishing or contributing to financial engineering instruments is spent for eligible expenditure within a timeframe of two years of the payment into the fund. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of Structural Funds financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007-2013."
4690EP7,"""""Flag State responsibilities for the enforcement of Council Directive 2009/13/EC implementing the Agreement on the Maritime Labour Convention""""",0.193,0.938,0.912,0.226,0.515,0.771,0.846,0.771,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish provisions in order to ensure that Member States effectively discharge their obligations as flag States to monitor compliance of ships flying their flag with Directive 2009/13/EC. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : on 23 February 2006, the International Labour Organisation adopted the Maritime Labour Convention, (MLC), desiring to create a single, coherent instrument embodying as far as possible all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour Conventions and Recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions. The MLC, adopted in 2006, provides comprehensive rights and protection at work for all seafarers regardless of their nationality and the flag of the ship. It aims to both achieve decent working conditions for seafarers and secure fair competition for quality shipowners. It sets out seafarers' rights to decent conditions of work on a wide range of subjects, and has been designed to be globally applicable, easily understandable, updatable and uniformly enforced. Council Decision 2007/431/EC has authorised the Member States to ratify the Convention. Member States should ratify it as soon as possible. Council Directive 2009/13/EC implements the Agreement concluded by the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF) on the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, and amends Directive 1999/63/EC. Directive 2009/13/EC was adopted on the basis of Article 155 of the Treaty. Since agreements concluded by virtue of Article 155 of the Treaty to be implemented by Council decisions can only cover matters defined by Article 153 of the Treaty, certain provisions of the Convention relating to flag State responsibilities for the enforcement of the Convention could not be part of the social agreement implemented by Directive 2009/13/EC. Those provisions should be integrated into Union law by virtue of this Directive. This proposal is closely associated with the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2009/16/EC on port State control. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a full public consultation offered an opportunity for Member States and stakeholders to express their views in June 2011. There was a general consensus on the need for updating the legislation related to flag State and port State in order to enforce the MLC requirements. The specific positive effects which were underlined consisted of reinforcing maritime safety, improving quality shipping, making the conditions of competition fairer between EU and non EU operators and between EU and non EU flags. Stakeholders also mentioned the better job quality for all seafarers. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) TFEU. CONTENT: the national flag constitutes the primary source of State responsibility for a ship. Flag States are required to ensure that their ships comply with the standards accepted by flag States under international law and conventions, in particular with international minimum standards. Directive 2009/21/EC seeks to ensure that the flag of all EU Member States have good standing (not being blacklisted…) and to incorporate the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)'s flag State audit scheme into EU law and to introduce the quality certification of the national maritime authorities. This proposal has different purposes. It does not refer to any IMO procedures but lays down principles to monitor the application of Directive 2009/13/EC taking up some of the Maritime Labour Convention standards. For the sake of clarity, it is preferable to have a separate text. In concrete terms, the proposal: · aims to ensure that the EU flag States meet their responsibilities in applying and enforcing Directive 2009/13/EC ; · refers to the definition of “ship” and “shipowner” based on the MLC definition and used in Directive 2009/13 to avoid any discrepancy between the standards and the implementation measures ; · lays down the obligation for flag State to establish mechanisms for inspection and to ensure the compliance of its ships with Directive 2009/13/EC ; · refers to professional qualifications and independence of staff in charge of verification so that the matters covered by Directive 2009/13/EC are rightly applied on board vessels flying the flags of the Member States concerned; · deals with the complaints on board EU flagged ships and lays down the principles and procedure to be followed by the flag States competent staff. Further to Joint Political Declarations, the Commission is now considering the need for explanatory documents on a case-by-case basis. By virtue of the principle of proportionality, explanatory documents have not been deemed justified in the present proposal since the proposal modifies only a limited number of legal obligations of an existing directive. Thus, the present proposal does not include the recital on explanatory documents. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
4762EP7,"""""Recreational craft and personal watercraft""""",0.825,0.894,0.825,0.484,0.333,0.759,0.872,0.829,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to set stricter limits for NOx, hydrocarbons (HC) and particulate matters for new recreational crafts. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Recreational Craft Directive 94/25/EC  was adopted in 1994 to regulate the placing on the market of pleasure boats on the European market. It was amended by Directive 2003/44/EC which introduces a set of limit values for exhaust emissions for propulsion engines and noise levels for watercrafts with propulsion engines, for both the compression ignition (CI) engines and the spark ignition (SI) engines. Furthermore, it enlarges the scope of the Recreational Craft Directive to cover also personal watercraft. The same amending Directive provides a review clause which aims at reinforcing emission limits to reflect the technological progress of recreational marine engines as well as the need to harmonise the limits worldwide, particularly with the US. At the same time the vulnerable position of the SMEs should be taken into account as this sector consists mainly of small and medium enterprises (more than 95% of businesses are SMEs). The Commission issued a report in 2007 in which it announced that it would assess options to further reducing the exhaust emission limits of recreational marine engines. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focuses on the following three areas of the revision having substantial impacts: A. Exhaust emission limits for engines Option 1 - No change (existing exhaust emissions are maintained). Option 2 - Stricter exhaust emission limits (Stage II) : in the context of this option, the scenario harmonises the limits with the US for both: Spark ignition (SI) engines and compression ignition (CI) engines. Option 3 - Stricter exhaust emission limits (Stage II) combined with mitigating measures to limit negative economic/social effects: Sub-option 3.1 – Use of a flexibility scheme. Sub-option 3.2 – Use of a transitional period for all engine manufacturers (3 years). Sub-option 3.3 – Use of a transitional period for all engine manufacturers + a specific transitional period for small and medium sized engine manufacturers placing on the EU market the SI outboard engines < 15 kW (3+3 years). T his last sub-option was selected in the impact assessment as the preferable option. B. Noise emission limits for watercrafts with propulsion engines. Option 1 - No change (existing noise emission limits are maintained). Option 2 – Stricter noise emission limits.  Option 1 (keeping the current limit values) was found to be the preferred option. C. Alignment of the RCD with the New Legislative Framework : the Commission is engaged to align the sectorial legislation to the new legislative framework, the impact assessment concentrated in analysing the impacts of the alignment only. These impacts should be mostly positive, since the horizontal provisions are clarifying certain issues which are subject to uncertainty for the moment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main elements of the proposed revision are as follows: Clarifying scope and concepts of the Directive : in the past, there have been debates about the content of the term “recreational craft” in the Directive which has been sometimes claimed to be an overall term covering both recreational craft and personal watercraft. This lack of clarity is now eliminated by introducing into the definitions a new overall concept “watercraft” which covers both recreational craft and personal watercraft. For reasons of consistency and clarification it is also specified that only personal watercraft intended for sports and leisure is included in the Directive, and not for instance personal watercraft intended for rescue and police services. General safety requirement : i t is necessary to specify explicitly that that products covered by this Directive may only be placed on the market or put into service if they meet the general requirement imposing them to be without danger to the safety and health of persons, property or environment and only if they meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I. Exhaust emissions : new stricter limits are foreseen for the exhaust emission of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Hydrocarbons (HC) and the Particulates (PT). For CI engines these limits are set applying the US EPA standards for marine diesel recreational engines (40 CFR Part 1042). For SI engines, the limits are set using the US EPA emission standards for new non-road SI engines, equipment and vessels (40 CFR Part 1045). A general three years transitional period for the industry is foreseen. In addition, as regards exhaust emission requirements, a supplementary 3 years is granted to SME engine manufacturers who place on the market the SI engines below 15 kW. Constructional requirements : a new requirement is foreseen to impose mandatory installation of holding tanks to watercraft fitted with toilets in order to contribute to the marine environmental protection. Post construction assessment and private importer : Directive 94/25/EC contains rules on the post construction assessment of recreational craft which is carried out by any natural or legal person established within the Community who places the product on the market in cases, where neither the manufacturer, nor his authorized representative fulfils the responsibilities for evaluating the conformity of products to the Directive. For consistency, it is appropriate to extent the scope of this procedure to cover not only recreational craft but also personal watercraft. For clarity, it must be specified by whom and in which situations exactly this procedure can be used. These are: private importer, that is a natural or legal person who imports in the course of non-commercial activity a product from a third country into the Union with the intention of putting it into service for his own use; any person placing on the market or putting into service an engine or a watercraft after a major modification or conversion thereof or any person changing the intended purpose of a watercraft not covered by the scope this Directive in a way that it falls under its scope; any person placing on the market a watercraft built for own use before the end of the 5 year period. As regards importing recreational craft and personal watercraft, it should be noted that compared to Directive 94/25/EC, the use of Post construction assessments is restricted to cases of non commercial import by private importers. In order to ensure a reliable assessment of the conformity of the product by the notified body with regard to the post construction assessment, there is a need to widen the obligations of the person asking for the post construction assessment to provide documents to the notified body. It is foreseen that he has to provide all the documents necessary for the assessment of the conformity of the product. Affixing of the CE-marking :t he CE marking must be affixed on the watercraft, engines and components. In case of components, where that are not possible or not warranted on account of the size or nature of that product, it can alternatively be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents. Reporting : in order to enforce the monitoring and the efficiency of this Directive, a new obligation is foreseen for the Member States to send every 5 years a report on the application of the Directive to the Commission. Aligning the Recreational Craft Directive with the New Legislative Framework (NLF) and the applicable conformity assessment procedures : c onsequently to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and of Decision 768/2008/EC, the Recreational Craft Directive has to be brought in line with the principles of New Legislative Framework. It means basically the inclusion of the chapters describing the obligations of economic operators, the competences of conformity assessment bodies and market surveillance authorities, new conformity assessment modules and the status of CE marking. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
5540EP8,"""""Fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law""""",0.043,0.005,0.02,0.917,0.212,0.0,0.01,0.231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down measures to prevent and fight fraud and other illegal activities in relation to the Union’s financial interests by providing for sanctions and for common definitions of offences. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to the 2010 Commission report on the protection of the Union's financial interests, suspected fraud amounts to approximately 600 million euro annually on the revenue and expenditure side despite the legal framework in place. It can be assumed that the actual amount is even higher as not all cases are detected and reported. The damage to the EU budget calls for action to ensure equivalent and effective protection of the Union's financial interests, including criminal law as far as this proves necessary. Despite the development of an EU acquis in this area which includes fraud, corruption and money laundering, Member States have adopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection within their national legal systems. According to the Commission, the actual common definition of offences in all Member States would reduce the risks of divergent practice, as they would ensure a uniform interpretation and a homogeneous way to meet all the necessary prosecution requirements. They would also strengthen the deterrent effect and enforcement potential of relevant provisions The proposal follows on from the Commission’s May 2011 communication “On the protection of the Union’s financial interests by criminal law and by administrative investigations” and the September 2011 communication “Towards a European criminal policy: Ensuring the effective implementation of EU policies through criminal law”. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the outcome of an external study which was completed in February 2012. The impact assessment concludes that a solution which in particular would extend the types of some fraud-related offences, introduce minimum sanctions and harmonise statutory limitation is to be preferred. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces the proposal for a Directive on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests. It seeks to set out harmonised criminal law provisions in the field of the protection of the Union's financial interests, while allowing Member States a certain degree of flexibility as regards how to impose more stringent provisions. In particular, the proposal: introduces a definition of the Union’s financial interests (fraud in relation to VAT is considered as affecting the EU's financial interests and is therefore covered by this proposed Directive); provides a definition of fraudulent behaviour to be criminalised in the Member States; provides that dishonest conduct of tenderers in public procurement is to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of corruption to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of misappropriation, which covers conduct by public officials that does not constitute fraud in a stricter sense, and which consists in the misappropriation of funds or assets contrary to the purpose foreseen, with the intention to damage the Union's financial interests; makes reference to anti-money laundering legislation (Directive 2005/60/EC) with respect to money-laundering of the proceeds of the offences, so that such money laundering will be criminalised in the Member States; requires Member States to criminalise also forms of preparation of and participation in the offences of incitement, aiding and abetting, attempt; requires Member States to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons; requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, and to set out a certain minimum set of criminal sanctions for natural persons; requires certain minimum imprisonment terms for particularly serious offences, based on thresholds set out for each offence; requires the existence of means of freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities from these offences; requires the Member States to take the necessary measures to establish their competence bases in regard to criminal offences so as to allow the judicial authorities to initiate investigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to the Union's financial interests. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this proposal has no immediate budgetary implications for the Union. Its aim is, however, to prevent losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests by increasing deterrence and making enforcement by criminal law authorities of the Member States more effective, as well as to facilitate recovery in cases where losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests have already occurred."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in June 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Kosovo on an EU-only Stabilisation and Association Agreement and adopted negotiating directives. The negotiations resulted in the initialling of the draft text of the agreement on 25 July 2014 which is the subject of this proposal. CONTENT: in this proposal, the Council is called upon to adopt the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and of Kosovo, of the other part, on behalf of the European Union, for the parts falling under the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Characteristics of the agreement: the Agreement is based on similar agreement signed with countries in the region, while taking into account that this is an EU-only agreement, as well as Kosovo’s particular situation. Legal basis: a ‘First agreement on principles governing the normalisation of relations’ was reached on 19 April 2013 in the framework of the EU-facilitated dialogue. The Agreement as signed provides for the establishment of an association between the EU and Kosovo involving reciprocal rights and obligations, common actions and special procedure. The decision to conclude this Agreement should therefore be based on the legal basis providing for the establishment of an association allowing the Union to enter into commitments in all areas covered by the Treaties. Main objectives of the Agreement: the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo provides for wide-ranging cooperation: Overall, the cooperation is underpinned by EU financial and technical assistance, which provides Kosovo with the necessary support and assistance in the implementation of certain aspects of the agreement. Recognition of Kosovo’s international status: it is important to note that the conclusion of the future agreement is without prejudice to Member States' position on the status of Kosovo, which will be decided in accordance with their national practice and international law. None of the terms, wording or definitions used in this proposal and the attached text of the Agreement, nor any recourse to all the necessary legal bases for the conclusion of the Agreement constitute recognition of Kosovo by the Union as an independent State nor does it constitute recognition by individual Member States of Kosovo in that capacity where they have not taken such a step."
6419EP7,"""""In vitro diagnostic medical devices""""",0.053,0.839,0.877,0.194,0.212,0.133,0.815,0.771,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to propose a new legislative framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the current EU regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices ('IVDs') consists of Directive 98/79/EC. It has demonstrated its merits but has also come under criticism in recent years. In an internal market with 32 participating countries and subject to constant scientific and technological progress, substantial divergences in the interpretation and application of the rules have emerged, thus undermining the main objectives of the Directive, i.e. the safety and performance of IVDs and their free movement. Triggered Resolution on defective silicone gel breast implants this revision of the current regulatory framework aims to overcome the flaws and gaps and to further strengthen patient safety. It aims to put in place a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that is 'fit for purpose'. The framework is supportive of innovation and the competitiveness of the in vitro diagnostic medical device industry and should allow rapid and cost-efficient market access for innovative IVDs to the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals. It should be noted that this proposal is adopted alongside a proposal for a Regulation on medical devices that are currently covered by the AIMDD and the MDD. While the specific features of IVDs and of the IVD sector require the adoption of a specific legislation distinct from the legislation on other medical devices, the horizontal aspects common to both sectors have been aligned. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : to a large extent, the scope of the proposed Regulation matches the scope of Directive 98/79/EC, i.e. it covers in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The proposed changes clarify and extend the scope of the IVD Directive. They concern: ·  high-risk devices manufactured and used within a single health institution, which are subject to most of the requirements set out in the proposal; ·  tests providing information about the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease (e.g. genetic tests) and tests providing information to predict treatment response or reactions (e.g. companion diagnostics), which are considered as in vitro diagnostic medical devices; ·  medical software, which is explicitly mentioned in the definition of IVDs. To support Member States and the Commission in determining the regulatory status of products, the Commission may set up, in accordance with its internal rules, a group of experts from various sectors (such as IVDs, medical devices, medicinal products, human tissues and cells, cosmetics and biocides). Definitions: this section has been significantly extended, aligning the definitions in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices with well-established European and international practice. Making available of devices, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement: t his chapter covers mainly horizontal issues similar for both medical devices and IVDs. It contains provisions that are typical for product-related internal market legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives of non-EU manufacturers, importers and distributors). It also provides clarification with regard to the adoption and the scope of common technical specifications (CTS) for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The legal obligations on manufacturers are proportionate to the risk class of the devices they produce. The following concepts are new in the field of IVDs: ·  a requirement has been introduced that within the manufacturer's organisation a 'qualified person' should be responsible for regulatory compliance. Similar requirements exist in EU legislation on medicinal products and in the national laws transposing the Directive on medical devices in some Member States. ·  since in the case of 'parallel trade' with in vitro diagnostic medical devices application of the principle of free movement of goods varies considerably from one Member State to another and, in many cases, de facto prohibits this practice, clear conditions are set for enterprises involved in relabelling and/or repackaging IVDs. Identification and traceability of devices, registration of devices and of economic operators, summary of safety and performance, Eudamed: this chapter addresses one of the main shortcomings of the current system: its lack of transparency. It consists of the following requirements: Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for notified bodies. It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies, based on stricter and detailed criteria laid down in Annex VI, with the individual Member State . Any new designation and, in regular intervals, the monitoring of notified bodies are made subject to 'joint assessments' with experts from other Member States and the Commission, thus ensuring an effective control at Union level. At intervals. Classification and conformity assessment : the proposal introduces a new risk-rule based classification system, built on GHTF principles, which replaces the current list of IVD medical devices in Annex II to Directive 98/79/EC. In the new classification system, IVDs will be divided into four classes of risk : A (lowest risk), B, C and D (highest risk). The conformity assessment procedures have been adapted to match each of these four device classes. The proposal tightens and streamlines the different conformity assessment procedures during which the notified body audits the manufacturer's quality management system, checks the technical documentation, examines the design dossier or approves the type of a device. These are laid down in Annexes VIII to X. One conformity assessment procedure provided for under the IVD Directive (EC verification) has been deleted and the concept of batch testing has been clarified. The proposal also: ·  Clinical evidence: the proposal spells out the requirements for clinical evidence for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that are proportionate to the risk class. The key obligations are set out in Chapter VI while more detailed provisions are laid down in Annex XII. While most clinical performance studies follow an observational design and therefore the results obtained are not used for patient management and do not impact treatment decisions, specific requirements have been introduced in Annex XIII for the conduct of interventional clinical performance studies and other clinical performance studies where the conduct of the study, including specimen collection, involves invasive procedures or other risks for the subjects of the studies. The concept of 'sponsor' is introduced. The scope of the proposal remains restricted to clinical performance studies carried out for regulatory purposes, i.e. for obtaining or confirming regulatory approval for market access. Non-commercial clinical performance studies that do not pursue a regulatory purpose are not covered by this Regulation. Every interventional clinical performance study and other clinical performance study involving risks for the subjects of the study shall be registered in a publicly accessible electronic system which the Commission will set up. Vigilance and market surveillance : Governance : a central role in achieving harmonised interpretation and practice will be assigned to an expert committee (the Medical Device Coordination Group or MDCG) made up of members appointed by the Member States due to their role and experience in the fields of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices and set up by Regulation on medical devices. The proposal mandates the Commission to provide technical, scientific and logistic support to the MDCG. It empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, either implementing acts to ensure uniform application of this Regulation, or delegated acts to complement the regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices over time. The future Regulation will replace and repeal Directive 98/79/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the above-mentioned Agreement between the EC and its Member States and South Africa (‘TDCA’) entered into force on 1 May 2004. Articles 18 and 103 of the TDCA call for a review of the Agreement within five years of its entry into force. At its meeting of 7 November 2005, the Joint Cooperation Council established the broad lines of the future revision of the TDCA, covering further liberalisation of trade, minor adjustments to the Title on Development Cooperation, updating the wording of several provisions concerning economic cooperation and cooperation in other areas. On that basis, the Commission submitted a proposal for a negotiating mandate in June 2006. In November 2006 the Council adopted a two-tier Decision giving the Commission two mandates. One was to give guidance to the Commission for revising the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation on the basis of Article 106(1) of the TDCA, which gives the Cooperation Council the power to decide on amendments put forward by any Party. The other was to authorise the opening of negotiations between the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other, to revise the Agreement on matters relating to the political dimension of the Agreement and to justice, freedom and security. However, in the course of the negotiations, for the sake of consistency, both sides agreed to forego the ‘lighter’ procedure of Article 106(1) of the TDCA, and to negotiate a single Agreement amending the TDCA. Consequently, the Commission negotiated this Agreement on the basis of the combined negotiating directives adopted by the Council, and in consultation with the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Working Party and the Africa Working Group. These two bodies were appointed by the Council, according to their respective responsibilities, as the special committees to assist the Commission in its task. The TDCA negotiations on trade and trade-related matters were suspended pending the outcome of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations. Throughout the negotiations, the Commission ensured that due account was taken of the process for implementing the Strategic Partnership between South Africa and the EU. The agreement was signed on behalf of the Community and Member States on 11 September 2009 in Kleinmond, South Africa in accordance with Council Decision 7437/08. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218 (6) (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: following the entry into force of the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU is substituting the European Community for the approval of the agreement. As stipulated in Article 3 of the Agreement, the Parties shall notify each other of the completion of the corresponding approval procedures and the respective instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU. As established in Article 4, the Amending Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the month in which the Parties notify each other that the necessary procedures have been completed. The current proposal is for a Council Decision concluding the amending agreement. It contains new provisions on terrorism, the International Criminal Court, weapons of mass destruction, mercenaries and small arms. The Commission therefore recommends that the Council adopt the attached Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : the European Council of 23-24 June requested a mechanism to respond to truly critical situations regarding Member States’ borders. This requires the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code established by Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 which lays down, on the one hand, the rules on border control at the external borders and, on the other hand, provides for the abolition of border control at internal borders and the possibility for its reintroduction in limited cases. Since the free movement of persons within the area without internal borders is a key Union achievement, the benefits of which are enjoyed by all the persons living in this area, it should require a decision to be taken at the Union level if this free movement is liable to be affected by a unilateral and sometimes opaque national decision. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 77 (1) and (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : this proposal amends Regulation (EC) No 562/2006, and sets out the general framework for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders as well as the criteria for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: General framework for reintroduction of border controls : where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, border control at internal borders may exceptionally be reintroduced at all or specific parts of the internal borders of one or several Member States for a limited period of no more than 30 days or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat if its duration exceeds the period of 30 days. This period may be extended under certain conditions, but shall not exceed six months. However, in cases of persistent serious deficiencies related to external border control or return procedures, the Commission can decide to extend this period. Criteria for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders: when making a decision on such a reintroduction, the Commission or the Member State concerned shall assess the extent to which such a measure is likely adequately to remedy the threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, and shall assess the proportionality of the measure to that threat. In making such an assessment, the following considerations shall in particular be taken into account: the likely impact of any threats to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, including following terrorist incidents or threats as well as threats posed by organised crime; the availability of technical or financial support measures which could be or have been resorted to at the national and/or European level, including assistance by Union bodies such as Frontex, the EASO or Europol, and the extent to which such measures are likely to adequately remedy the threats to public policy or internal security; the impact of any serious deficiencies related to external border control or return procedures identified by Schengen evaluations in accordance with the Regulation on the establishment of an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis; the likely impact of such a measure on free movement within the area without internal border controls. Before taking a decision, the Commission may request further information from Member States, Frontex, Europol, Eurojust, the Fundamental Rights Agency or any other Union body, and may also carry out inspection visits. Procedure for the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders: the Member State concerned shall submit a request to the Commission at the latest six weeks before the planned reintroduction, or within a shorter period where the circumstances giving rise to the need to reintroduce border control at internal borders do not become known until less than six weeks before the planned reintroduction, and shall supply the following information to the Commission, Member States and the European Parliament: the reasons for the proposed reintroduction, including all relevant data detailing the events that constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level; the scope of the proposed reintroduction, specifying at which part of the internal borders border control is to be reintroduced; the names of the authorised crossing-points; the date and duration of the proposed reintroduction; where appropriate, the measures to be taken by the other Member States. Such a request could also be submitted jointly by two or more Member States. The Commission shall decide on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders through implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure and will also decide on their prolongation. Specific procedure for cases requiring immediate action : where a serious threat to public policy or internal security in a Member State demands immediate action, the Member State concerned may exceptionally and immediately reintroduce border control at internal borders, for a limited period of no more than five days, andnotify the other Member States and the Commission accordingly, supplying the necessary information and the reasons that justify the use of this procedure. If the serious threat to public policy or internal national security persists beyond 5 days, the Commission shall decide on the prolongation of the border control at internal borders. Specific procedure for cases of persistent serious deficiencies : where the Commission finds that there are persistent serious deficiencies related to external border control or return procedures and insofar as these deficiencies constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level, border control at internal borders may be reintroduced for a period of no more than six months, which may be prolonged by a further period of no more than six months if the serious deficiencies are not remedied, up to three such prolongations. The Commission shall decide on the re-introduction of border control at internal borders, as well as any prolongation, The Commission and the Member State(s) concerned shall inform the European Parliament and the Council as soon as possible of any reasons which might trigger the application of these provisions. Report : at the latest four weeks after the lifting of border control at internal borders, the Member State which has carried out border control at internal borders shall present a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders, outlining, in particular, the operation of the checks and the effectiveness of the reintroduction of border control at internal borders. Informing the public : the Commission shall inform the public on a decision to reintroduce border control at internal borders and indicate in particular the start and end date of such a measure, unless there are overriding security reasons for not doing so."" BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
466EP9,"""""CAP: Financial discipline as from financial year 2021 and flexibility between pillars in respect of calendar year 2020""""",0.935,0.857,0.959,0.781,0.421,1.037,0.857,0.659,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers in the year 2020 and ensuring the respect of budgetary ceilings for the EAGF by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in relation to the financing of the CAP, certain amendments of Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Horizontal Regulation) are needed to ensure that the financial discipline mechanism that makes it possible to respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation on the multi-annual financial framework can still operate for financial years post 2020. In relation to Direct Payments, Regulation (EU) 2019/288 amended Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy (Direct Payments Regulation) to extend the flexibility between pillars foreseen for calendar years 2015-2019 to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. This regulation sets up the amounts to transfer from the rural development to direct payments envelope as a percentage of the amount allocated to support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021 by Union legislation adopted after the adoption by the Council of the relevant Regulation pursuant to Article 312(2) TFEU. The relevant Union legislation may not be in place by the time the Member States need to notify their decision to transfer. To make it possible to apply the flexibility from rural development to direct payments, it is appropriate to establish the maximum amount that can be transferred based on a fixed amount and not a percentage. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulations (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council aims to ensure the continuity of certain elements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a transitional period of one year from 2014-2020 until the rules on CAP strategic plans are applied, in line with the Commission's proposal on support for CAP strategic plans. Update of the reference for determining a financial discipline rate Expenditure under the EAGF within a given financial year shall respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For that purpose, the said Regulation provides for the determination of a financial discipline adjustment rate. However, currently the relevant provisions refer to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 which only sets the relevant ceilings for the period 2014-2020. To ensure that the ceiling for the financing of market related expenditure and direct payments post 2020 will also be respected, the legal reference of Articles 16 and 26 should be amended to include the regulation to be adopted by the Council for financial year 2021 onwards. Change of the basis for notifying the transfer from rural development to direct payments To ensure continuity in the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between the two pillars, already decided by the colegislators in Regulation (EU) 2019/288, the Commission proposed to replace the percentage of transfer by maximum absolute amounts based on the current maximum percentages. Member States had the possibility to review by 1 August 2019 the percentage of their national ceiling for direct payments, which they want to allocate to Voluntary Coupled Support (VCS), as well as their detailed support decisions (i.e. list of support measures and their envelopes, targeting, etc.). This review, if any, will apply from claim year 2020. In addition, Member States will have to notify only by 31 December 2019 or shortly thereafter their transfers between pillars affecting their national ceiling for direct payments for calendar year 2020. Budgetary implications The amounts included in the transitional proposal are in line with amounts proposed for the CAP under Heading 3 in the proposal covering the Multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. For market-related expenditure financed by the EAGF, allocations under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be adjusted to the level which were proposed for the same sectors in the proposal on support for the CAP strategic plans, for financial year 2021. The amendments of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 ensure that a financial discipline adjustment rate can be determined in financial years 2021 and onwards where the expenditure forecasts for the measures financed under the EAGF net ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings would be exceeded. Thereby, the amendment potentially decreases expenditure under EAGF to the maximum level agreed for the fund in the multiannual financial framework. The amendment of the flexibility provision for calendar year 2020 (financial year 2021) is a technical adjustment to ensure applicability of the provision and does not have any financial implications compared to those intended for the existing provision. The review option for the voluntary coupled support may lead to financial reallocations between measures within the Member States but these will remain within the national ceiling and as such do not require additional financing."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on insolvency proceedings (recast) entered into force on 26 June 2015. It will apply from 26 June 2017, with the exception of the part relating to the system for interconnection of national insolvency registers, which will apply from 26 June 2019. Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in point (4) of Article 2 of the Regulation. Annex B lists the insolvency practitioners referred to in point (5) of Article 2. In December 2015, Poland notified the Commission on a substantial reform of its domestic law on restructuring, taking effect as of 1 January 2016, and requested to change the lists set out in Annexes A and B to the Regulation accordingly. After having carefully analysed the request of Poland in order to ensure compliance of the notification with the requirements of the Regulation, the Commission is proposing to amend Regulation ((EU) 2015/848 accordingly. CONTENT: the Commission proposal seeks to replace the lists for Poland in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking into account the information notified by that Member States. Since the Annexes are intrinsic part of the Regulation, their modification can only be achieved via the legislative amendment of the Regulation. This proposal aims at ensuring that the scope of the recast Regulation is adjusted to the actual legal framework of the Member States on insolvency by the time of its application. The envisaged amendments are of a purely technical nature. They contain no substantive change to the Regulation."
5171EP8,"""""In vitro diagnostic medical devices""""",0.043,0.0,0.0,0.958,0.192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to propose a new legislative framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the current EU regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices ('IVDs') consists of Directive 98/79/EC. It has demonstrated its merits but has also come under criticism in recent years. In an internal market with 32 participating countries and subject to constant scientific and technological progress, substantial divergences in the interpretation and application of the rules have emerged, thus undermining the main objectives of the Directive, i.e. the safety and performance of IVDs and their free movement. Triggered Resolution on defective silicone gel breast implants this revision of the current regulatory framework aims to overcome the flaws and gaps and to further strengthen patient safety. It aims to put in place a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that is 'fit for purpose'. The framework is supportive of innovation and the competitiveness of the in vitro diagnostic medical device industry and should allow rapid and cost-efficient market access for innovative IVDs to the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals. It should be noted that this proposal is adopted alongside a proposal for a Regulation on medical devices that are currently covered by the AIMDD and the MDD. While the specific features of IVDs and of the IVD sector require the adoption of a specific legislation distinct from the legislation on other medical devices, the horizontal aspects common to both sectors have been aligned. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : to a large extent, the scope of the proposed Regulation matches the scope of Directive 98/79/EC, i.e. it covers in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The proposed changes clarify and extend the scope of the IVD Directive. They concern: ·  high-risk devices manufactured and used within a single health institution, which are subject to most of the requirements set out in the proposal; ·  tests providing information about the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease (e.g. genetic tests) and tests providing information to predict treatment response or reactions (e.g. companion diagnostics), which are considered as in vitro diagnostic medical devices; ·  medical software, which is explicitly mentioned in the definition of IVDs. To support Member States and the Commission in determining the regulatory status of products, the Commission may set up, in accordance with its internal rules, a group of experts from various sectors (such as IVDs, medical devices, medicinal products, human tissues and cells, cosmetics and biocides). Definitions: this section has been significantly extended, aligning the definitions in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices with well-established European and international practice. Making available of devices, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement: t his chapter covers mainly horizontal issues similar for both medical devices and IVDs. It contains provisions that are typical for product-related internal market legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives of non-EU manufacturers, importers and distributors). It also provides clarification with regard to the adoption and the scope of common technical specifications (CTS) for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The legal obligations on manufacturers are proportionate to the risk class of the devices they produce. The following concepts are new in the field of IVDs: ·  a requirement has been introduced that within the manufacturer's organisation a 'qualified person' should be responsible for regulatory compliance. Similar requirements exist in EU legislation on medicinal products and in the national laws transposing the Directive on medical devices in some Member States. ·  since in the case of 'parallel trade' with in vitro diagnostic medical devices application of the principle of free movement of goods varies considerably from one Member State to another and, in many cases, de facto prohibits this practice, clear conditions are set for enterprises involved in relabelling and/or repackaging IVDs. Identification and traceability of devices, registration of devices and of economic operators, summary of safety and performance, Eudamed: this chapter addresses one of the main shortcomings of the current system: its lack of transparency. It consists of the following requirements: Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for notified bodies. It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies, based on stricter and detailed criteria laid down in Annex VI, with the individual Member State . Any new designation and, in regular intervals, the monitoring of notified bodies are made subject to 'joint assessments' with experts from other Member States and the Commission, thus ensuring an effective control at Union level. At intervals. Classification and conformity assessment : the proposal introduces a new risk-rule based classification system, built on GHTF principles, which replaces the current list of IVD medical devices in Annex II to Directive 98/79/EC. In the new classification system, IVDs will be divided into four classes of risk : A (lowest risk), B, C and D (highest risk). The conformity assessment procedures have been adapted to match each of these four device classes. The proposal tightens and streamlines the different conformity assessment procedures during which the notified body audits the manufacturer's quality management system, checks the technical documentation, examines the design dossier or approves the type of a device. These are laid down in Annexes VIII to X. One conformity assessment procedure provided for under the IVD Directive (EC verification) has been deleted and the concept of batch testing has been clarified. The proposal also: ·  Clinical evidence: the proposal spells out the requirements for clinical evidence for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that are proportionate to the risk class. The key obligations are set out in Chapter VI while more detailed provisions are laid down in Annex XII. While most clinical performance studies follow an observational design and therefore the results obtained are not used for patient management and do not impact treatment decisions, specific requirements have been introduced in Annex XIII for the conduct of interventional clinical performance studies and other clinical performance studies where the conduct of the study, including specimen collection, involves invasive procedures or other risks for the subjects of the studies. The concept of 'sponsor' is introduced. The scope of the proposal remains restricted to clinical performance studies carried out for regulatory purposes, i.e. for obtaining or confirming regulatory approval for market access. Non-commercial clinical performance studies that do not pursue a regulatory purpose are not covered by this Regulation. Every interventional clinical performance study and other clinical performance study involving risks for the subjects of the study shall be registered in a publicly accessible electronic system which the Commission will set up. Vigilance and market surveillance : Governance : a central role in achieving harmonised interpretation and practice will be assigned to an expert committee (the Medical Device Coordination Group or MDCG) made up of members appointed by the Member States due to their role and experience in the fields of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices and set up by Regulation on medical devices. The proposal mandates the Commission to provide technical, scientific and logistic support to the MDCG. It empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, either implementing acts to ensure uniform application of this Regulation, or delegated acts to complement the regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices over time. The future Regulation will replace and repeal Directive 98/79/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: · powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) TFEU (delegated acts); · and on the other hand, powers conferred on the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts, as laid down in Article 291(2) TFEU (implementing acts). Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 stipulates that if it appears in the light of scientific advice that the fishing mortality rates and associated spawning stock biomass levels used for the purposes of the plan are no longer appropriate, the Council must revise such parameters so as to ensure that the plan can attain its management objectives. The Regulation currently in force confers the power to amend these non-essential elements of the plan on the Council. Such a decision-making procedure is no longer possible under the TFEU. The powers conferred on the Commission by Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 must therefore be classified as delegated or implementing measures. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for interested parties to be consulted or for an impact assessment to be carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the main thrust of the proposal is to identify the powers conferred on the Commission by Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and to classify them as delegated or implementing powers. In order to amend or supplement non-essential elements of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty is delegated to the Commission in respect of the following: · changes to the established values for the maximum fishing mortality rates and associated spawning stock biomass levels, when the target fishing mortality rate has been reached; · the rules concerning: (i) the adjustment of the fishing effort where a group of vessels is excluded from or re-included in the effort regime; (ii) the method for calculating the fishing capacity and the adjustment of the maximum capacity levels due to permanent cessation of fishing activities and capacity transfers; (iii) the calculation method for adapting the maximum allowable fishing effort; and (iv) changes to the composition of the geographical areas and gear groupings. Furthermore, implementing powers are conferred on the Commission in respect of detailed rules on the procedure and format for transmitting the information required to the Commission, and the format of the special fishing permit and of the list of vessels holding such special permit. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 of 18 September 2007 establishing a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks. This act was adopted prior to the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Powers conferred on the Commission : the main legal action is to identify the powers conferred upon the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 and to classify these as delegated or implementing powers. The core objective of the plan is to ensure that Baltic cod stocks can be exploited under sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. Science may evolve and improve, and the plan needs to contain the necessary provisions to ensure it is kept up to date with the best science available. Article 27 of the Regulation stipulates that if scientific advice indicates that that the fishing mortality rates are disaccording with the objectives of the plan, the Council must by qualified majority revise mortality rates as to ensure that the plan can attain its management objectives. The current text therefore confers the power to amend these non-essential elements of the plan on the Council. Such decision-making procedure is no longer possible under the TFEU. Similarly, Article 26 provides for modification by the Council of certain non-essential elements of the plan to ensure that the objectives are met. Article 290 of the TFEU provides that a legislative act may delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act. By way of consequence, the decision-making procedure in Article 26 and 27 of the Regulation should be converted into a system of delegated powers to be exercised by the Commission under the conditions set out in the plan itself. The plan should therefore be amended accordingly. Evaluation: the plan requires evaluation of the impact of the management measures on the stocks concerned and on the fisheries concerned. The timeline set in the Regulation in force is neither feasible nor efficient. This requirement means considerable difficulties due to the limited availability of relevant data to carry out appropriate assessment. Consequently, the timeline for evaluation of the plan should be modified. Furthermore, implementing powers should be given to the Commission to confirm whether the conditions established in Article 29 of the Regulation are fulfilled and, consequently whether relevant provisions apply in the subdivisions concerned. Maximum sustainable yield : the Commission and Member States signed up to the aim of achieving a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for depleted stocks by 2015 at the latest, but it is not indicated as objective of the plan. To avoid any ambiguities in the plan the reference to the maximum sustainable yield should be included in the plan. The Regulation is amended accordingly to clarify that the procedure at issue is that provided for by the Treaty. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with the new OLAF Regulation (Regulation 883/2013), the Supervisory Committee of the European Anti-Fraud Office is tasked with regularly monitoring the implementation by the Office of its investigative function, in order to reinforce its independence, and in particular to monitor developments concerning the application of procedural guarantees and the duration of investigations in the light of the information supplied by the Director General. However, in the recent past some concerns have been voiced about possible conflicts of interest and calls have been made for a strengthened legal independence as regards the management of the Committee's budget and secretariat. Thus, in its Annual Activity Reports of 2013 and 2014, the Supervisory Committee underlined the importance of its independent and effective functioning which requires an independent and adequately staffed secretariat. The European Parliament called several times on the Commission to take measures to reinforce the independent functioning of OLAF's Supervisory Committee secretariat, such as in its report on the discharge procedure for 20134 or in its resolution on the OLAF Supervisory Committee's annual report 2014. On 18 December 2015, the Commission adopted an amendment to its Decision 1999/352 in order to move the responsibility for the implementation of the budgetary appropriations for the Members from the Director-General of OLAF to the Commission. The Commission subsequently delegated this responsibility to the Director of its Payments Office (PMO). The framework for the implementation of the budgetary appropriations relating to the Members of the Supervisory Committee should be set up in a way which avoids any appearance of a possible interference of the Office in their duties. The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee should be provided directly by the Commission, independently from the Office. The Commission should refrain from interfering with the functions of the Supervisory Committee. CONTENT: in order to separate the management of the Committee's secretariat from the management of the Office and to avoid any impression that OLAF can impair the functioning of the support to the Committee's Members, the Commission proposes to modify Regulation 883/2013 to foresee that the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee will be provided directly by the Commission, and no longer by OLAF. Lastly, the proposal seeks to amend the wording of Regulation so that the competence of OLAF's Data Protection Officer (DPO) will continue to cover the processing of data by the secretariat. Also, the secretariat's staff will continue to be subject to the same confidentiality rules as before. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation will not require any new human or administrative resources and will have no financial impact. It will only transfer the management of the budgetary appropriations concerning the secretariat of OLAF's Supervisory Committee within the Commission."
12487EP9,"""""Strengthening the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women""""",0.016,0.385,0.932,0.315,0.263,0.657,0.805,0.732,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish minimum requirements to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women through pay transparency and enforcement mechanism. PURPOSE: to set up a European Partnership on Metrology jointly undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 2 and 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union enshrine the right to equality between women and men as one of the core values and tasks of the Union. The European pillar of social rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, includes among its principles equal treatment of women and men and the right to equal pay for work of equal value. Despite Directive 2006/54/EC, supplemented in 2014 by a Commission Recommendation on pay transparency, the effective implementation of the principle of equal pay remains problematic in practice in the EU. The gender pay gap in the EU remains at around 14%. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences on female workers make it even more urgent to address this issue. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for more action at EU level to improve the implementation of equal pay provisions. The Council has called on both the Member States and the Commission to act. Following the evaluation of the existing framework on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, the gender equality strategy 2020-2025 announced binding measures on pay transparency. CONTENT: the proposed directive aims to address the persistent inadequacy in the application of the fundamental right to equal pay and to ensure that this right is respected throughout the EU, by setting standards for pay transparency to enable workers to assert their right to equal pay. Member States could provide for a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive. Same work and work of equal value The proposal requires Member States to establish tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of work in line with a set of objective criteria which include educational, professional and training requirements, skills, effort and responsibility, work undertaken and the nature of the tasks involved. The availability of clear criteria at national level will help workers to establish a valid comparator and assess whether they are treated less favourably than the comparator performing the same work or work of equal value. Pay transparency The proposal: - requires employers to provide, prior to the job interview, information on the initial pay level or a corresponding range (based on objective and gender-neutral criteria) to be paid to the future worker in relation to a specific position or job. Employers would not have the right to ask applicants about their pay history in their former employment relationship; - requires employers to make available to workers a description of the gender-neutral criteria used to define their pay and career progression; - gives workers the right to ask their employer for information on their individual pay level and on average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work or work of equal value; - requires employers with at least 250 workers to make publicly accessible certain information, such as the pay gap between female and male workers in their organisation. On the basis of the information provided, employees and their representatives would have the right to ask the employer for clarification of this information; - obliges the employers concerned to carry out a pay assessment in cooperation with employee representatives where the pay information indicates a gender pay gap of at least 5%, which the employer cannot justify on the basis of objective and gender-neutral factors. Better access to justice for victims of pay discrimination With regard to redress and enforcement, the proposal: - requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to enforce the rights and obligations under the Directive; - introduces the right for equality bodies and workers’ representatives or other legal entities to act on behalf or in support of a worker, and for them to bring collective claims to court; - obliges Member States to ensure that any worker who is a victim of sex discrimination in pay can obtain full compensation for the harm caused; - increases the burden of proof on the employer: the employer, not the worker, should prove the absence of discrimination in relation to pay; - provides that the limitation period for bringing a claim under the proposed Directive should be at least three years; - requires Member States to establish specific penalties for infringements of the equal pay rule, including minimum fines."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: GMES is an Earth observation initiative led by the EU, which has decided to develop its own operational Earth observation capacity in order to reflect its growing responsibility in European and world affairs. Over the last thirty years, the EU, the European Space Agency (ESA) and their Member States have made substantial R&D efforts in the field of Earth observation, with a view to developing infrastructure and pre-operational Earth observation services. However, with the exception of the field of operational meteorology, the data provided by the existing services either do not cover all the parameters needed by policy-makers or are not provided on a continuous basis. In other words, many of the existing Earth observation services in Europe are unreliable due to infrastructure gaps and lack of guarantees on their availability in the long term. GMES was conceived to ensure operational Earth observation in environmental and security domains beyond operational meteorology. It comprises both development activities and an operational phase. Following the Commission Communication entitled “Global Monitoring for Environment and Security: From Concept to Reality” (see COM(2008)0748 ) and the orientations of the Third Space Council, implementation of GMES operations is following a phased approach, based on clearly identified priorities, starting with development of three fast-track services on emergency response, land monitoring and marine services. Establishing such a system marks a strategic choice, with a lasting impact on the further political, economic, social and scientific development of the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in addition to the baseline (“Do nothing”) scenario, the Impact Assessment report analyses three options for implementation of GMES initial operations: Open method of coordination only; Regulatory intervention; Community financing. The Impact Assessment demonstrates that Community financing is regarded the best option, as it is likely to be more cost-effective and would offer value for money and give the downstream sector a sustainable basis on which to develop customised services. CONTENT : the objective of this proposal is to establish a legal basis for the GMES programme and EC funding of GMES initial operations (2011–2013), in order to: enable the provision of emergency response services (including emergency maps and reference maps) to various emergency response actors at Community and Member State level, as well as the key United Nations agencies, in the areas of civil protection, humanitarian aid and crisis management between 2011 and 2013, on a 24/7 basis, so that they can respond to emergencies and humanitarian disasters more efficiently and effectively; enable the provision of land monitoring services (in particular, pre-processed data, pan-European land cover products, high-resolution maps of cities, soil maps and thematic maps) to public authorities (including environmental agencies) in Europe between 2011 and 2013, so that they will be better able to perform their policy-making, implementation and monitoring tasks. Land monitoring services could support, inter alia, the implementation of the Soil Thematic Strategy and the assessment of ecosystems; contribute to the production and availability to public of environmental information, in line, in particular, with the principles of the Aarhus Convention, the INSPIRE Directive and the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS); stimulate, by lowering the cost of access to information, the growth of the downstream Earth observation sector in terms of jobs, innovation and international competitiveness between 2011 and 2013. A fully fledged GMES programme is expected to be in place in the course of the next multiannual financial framework (from 2014). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: research and development aspects of GMES are currently, and will continue to be, co-financed at European, intergovernmental and national levels. Part of the cost of development and operation of all the space-based and in situ installations providing data for the GMES services will be borne by Member States and intergovernmental organisations. The EC will concentrate on domains where Community intervention will provide clear added value. The EU will both coordinate these partnerships and manage its own contribution to GMES. With the exception of a limited contribution to operation of the emergency response and land monitoring services financed as preparatory actions, this contribution currently consists, in particular, of co-financing the following research activities under the space theme of FP7: space infrastructure development carried out by ESA to fill gaps in existing space infrastructure; research on integration of in situ data and space data; pre-operational service development. For pre-operational services, the funding is focusing mainly on development of the processing chain and efforts to validate the concepts and the technologies and services developed.  For the period 2011–2013, this means that the FP7 funds already allocated to the space theme should be supplemented by additional non-research funds under the proposed Regulation to cover GMES initial operations. The proposed Regulation states that the financial envelope allocated to the implementation of the Regulation shall be EUR 107 million. Third countries or international organisations may also provide additional funding for the GMES programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 allows Member States to compensate 36 enumerated railway undertakings for the payment of obligations which undertakings of other transport modes do not have to support, such as special family allowances and pensions. When the rules for normalisation are correctly applied, such State support is considered compatible with the internal market and Member States are exempted from State aid notification obligations, Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 was adopted before the rail market was liberalised and when rail transport in Europe was developing primarily within national borders, with integrated companies both operating rail services and managing rail infrastructure. Today, this Regulation is inconsistent and incompatible with legislative measures currently in force, as well as with the fundamental principles laid down in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a single European railway area which include that: (i) railway undertakings shall be managed according to principles that apply to commercial companies; (ii) entities responsible for the allocation of capacity and charging for rail infrastructure shall be separate from entities which operate rail services; (iii) there shall be a separation of accounts; (iv) any railway undertaking licensed in accordance with EU criteria should have access to railway infrastructure on fair, non-discriminatory terms; and (v) that infrastructure managers may benefit from State financing. Regulation (EEC) In the context of a liberalised market where railway undertakings compete directly with the traditional monopolies listed in the Regulation, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to discriminate between these two groups of undertakings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. However, it requested information from Member States about application of the Regulation in May 2010 and in June 2011. Responses revealed that, between 2007 and 2010, a majority of Member States had not received applications from railway undertakings and had not made payments of compensation under the Regulation. A majority of Member States indicated they saw no ongoing need for the Regulation and some explicitly expressed their support for repeal or their opinion that the Regulation is obsolete or out of date. On the basis of the data provided by Member States, it was concluded that the impact of a repeal of the Regulation would be very minimal. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91 and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 to eliminate inconsistencies in the EU legal order and will contribute to simplification by eliminating a legal act which is now obsolete. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EU) No 216/2013 provides that the electronic edition of the Official Journal shall bear an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate and created with a secure-signature-creation device, in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC. In addition to the electronic signature and the advanced electronic signature already provided for in Directive 1999/93 (repealed with effect from 1 July 2016), Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 introduced the possibility of authenticating a document with an electronic seal or an advanced electronic seal based on an electronic seal certificate. Since authentication by an electronic seal rather than an electronic signature is not merely a different electronic system but makes an actual difference in legal terms (in the case of a signature, the authentication method is based on the involvement of a specific natural person; where a seal is used, it is created by the legal person with no indication of who, within the legal person, was responsible for authenticating the document), Regulation No 216/2013 should be amended accordingly. CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to amend Regulation No 216/2013 to allow the Official Journal to be authenticated by an advanced electronic seal based on a qualified certificate in accordance with Regulation 910/2014. The Commission considers that the use of the advanced electronic seal will make it possible to automate electronic signatures and accelerate the procedure for publication on EUR-Lex. The signature will no longer be that of a named official but a recognised body of the European Union, i.e. the Publications Office. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the human resources required will be met by staff from the DG who are already assigned to management of the action and/or have been redeployed within the DG, together if necessary with any additional allocation which may be granted to the managing DG under the annual allocation procedure and in the light of budgetary constraints."
4008EP7,"""""Groundhandling services at Union airports""""",0.439,0.714,0.053,0.323,0.364,0.723,0.769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to improve the efficiency and the overall quality of groundhandling services at Union airports for end-users (airlines) and final users (passengers and freight forwarders). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Commission and stakeholders' estimations, the revenues of groundhandling (all categories included) amount globally to EUR 50 billion. It is estimated that the sector employs at least 60,000 persons in Europe. The cost linked to groundhandling services for airlines represents 5 to 12% of operating costs. In 1996 the European Community adopted Council Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports. The Directive was a first step towards the gradual opening and harmonisation of access to the groundhandling market. It would appear from the consultation organised by the Commission and the evaluation of the Directive in force that the current legal framework is no longer fit for purpose. The problem identified is twofold: (i) the provision of groundhandling services is not efficient enough due to barriers to entry and expansion, and (ii) the overall quality of groundhandling services is not keeping pace with evolving needs in terms of reliability, resilience, safety and security and the environment. It is therefore necessary to improve the efficiency and the overall quality of groundhandling services with the following objectives: ensure airlines have an increased choice of groundhandling solutions at EU airports; harmonise and clarify national administrative conditions for market entry (approvals); ensure a level playing field at airport level between groundhandling companies operating under different regulatory regimes; increase coordination between groundhandling providers at the airport (airport operators as ground coordinators within the EU aviation network as part of the gate-to-gate approach); clarify the legal framework for training of staff and transfer of staff. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four policy packages (in addition to the option to keep the existing framework) were considered to assess how Directive 96/67/EC could be revised Policy package PP1 would improve the system via minimal Directive amendments and by providing guidance where possible. Policy package PP2 seeks to improve the current system through a more ambitious set of measures. Policy package PP3 seeks to improve the current system with high intensity policy measures, providing full harmonisation of the groundhandling market legal framework. Only the policy package PP2 fully satisfies the identified objectives as demonstrated in the impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal concerns the adoption of a regulation on groundhandling services at EU airports. The new regulation is intended to replace and repeal the existing Directive 96/67/EC. Full opening of the self-handling market and increase in the minimum number of service providers to three at large airports: every airport user should be allowed to self-handle. Moreover, the number of authorised third-party suppliers of groundhandling services should not be less than three suppliers at large airports with not less than 5 million passengers annually or 100 000 tonnes of freight. Mutual recognition of approvals with harmonised requirements: the mutual recognition of national approvals with harmonised requirements will reduce administrative costs for operators and reduce barriers to entry. Better management of centralised infrastructures: the proposal includes a clear legal framework for the definition of centralised infrastructure and for the fees to be charged to suppliers of groundhandling services and self-handling airlines for the centralised infrastructure. Legal separation of airports and their groundhandling activities : the proposal provides that if an airport is itself a provider of groundhandling services, it should be ensured that the groundhandling services provided by the airport do not unduly benefit from the airport management activities of the airport. Improved tender procedure : the proposal provides for an increase of the maximum duration for which a supplier of restricted groundhandling services is selected from 7 to 10 years. It contains further specifications on the details of the selection procedure for the suppliers of restricted services to ensure a harmonious application and ensure that selected companies are indeed those best suited to operate groundhandling services. In the selection of the supplier for restricted groundhandling services the AUC needs to be consulted. The proposal contains provisions for rules of procedure for the Airport Users' Committee to avoid any conflict of interest for airlines also providing groundhandling services. Clarified rules for subcontracting: the proposal contains clear rules for subcontracting allowing suppliers of groundhandling services to subcontract but limiting subcontracting by airports and self-handling airlines to situations of force majeure and prohibiting cascade subcontracting. Role of the managing body of the airport in the coordination of ground services: the managing body of the airport should be responsible for the proper coordination of groundhandling activities at its airport. Moreover, at large airports, which are particularly important for the European air transport network, the managing body of the airport needs to ensure that these operations are coordinated through an airport CDM and through a proper contingency plan. Responsibility of airport operators for minimum quality requirements for groundhandling operations to be defined in delegated act : the proposal provides the setting of minimum quality standards for the performance of groundhandling services to be met by all suppliers of groundhandling service and self-handling airport users. Reporting obligations on performance of groundhandling services (to be defined in delegated act): suppliers of groundhandling services and self-handling airport users should be required to report on the performance of their groundhandling services. Compulsory minimum training for staff: the proposal introduces minimum training requirements for all suppliers of groundhandling services and self-handling airlines to ensure the safety and security of operations and to create a level playing field among operators. Possibility for Member States to impose a requirement to take over staff with same conditions where there is a tender procedure: the tender system appears to encourage turnover of staff. Discontinuity of staff can have a detrimental effect on the quality of groundhandling services. It is therefore appropriate to clarify the rules on the takeover of staff beyond the application of Directive 2001/23/EC on transfers of undertakings and to enable Member States to ensure adequate employment and working conditions. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices establishes a new regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices, such as HIV tests, pregnancy tests or SARS-CoV-2 tests. The new Regulation will replace the current Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices from 26 May 2022 and introduce substantial changes in the sector. One of the main changes concerns the involvement of independent conformity assessment bodies (‘notified bodies’). Currently, only a relatively small number of high-risk devices (about 8% of all in vitro diagnostics on the market) is subject to notified body control under Directive 98/79/EC. Under the Regulation, around 80% of in vitro diagnostic medical devices will be under the control of notified bodies, the vast majority of them for the first time. The COVID-19 public health crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that demand substantial additional resources, as well as increased availability of vitally important in vitro diagnostic medical devices, that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of Regulation (EU) 2017/746. Data on market readiness collected by the European Commission show that Member States, health institutions, notified bodies and economic operators will not be in a position to comply with the new rules within the timeframe foreseen. In vitro diagnostic medical devices are essential for the health and safety of Union citizens and SARS-CoV-2 tests, in particular, are vital for the fight against the pandemic. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the transitional arrangements to allow for a gradual implementation of the Regulation in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of these devices on the Union market. The European Parliament, in a cross-party letter of 11 May 2021 signed by several political groups, called on the Commission to present a legislative proposal to smooth the transition to the new regulatory framework and to ensure the availability of in vitro diagnostic medical devices on the EU market. CONTENT: in order to ensure legal certainty and to avoid potential market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend the existing transitional period for devices covered by a certificate issued under Directive 98/79/EC and to introduce tailored transitional periods for devices that are to be subject to conformity assessment involving notified bodies for the first time under Regulation (EU) 2017/746. The length of the transitional period should depend on the risk class of the device concerned: - for high-risk devices such as HIV or hepatitis tests (class D) and certain influenza tests (class C), the transitional period ends on 26 May 2025 and 26 May 2026, and - for low-risk devices such as Class B and A sterile devices, 26 May 2027. The Commission proposes to also introduce a transitional period for the requirements for devices manufactured and used within the same health institution (‘in-house devices’). This will give health institutions extra time to comply with the new requirements and ensure that in-house tests, which are often essential –especially for rare diseases, can continue to be developed in clinical laboratories."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the initial regulatory framework for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/841, was adopted in 2018 and covers CO2 emissions and removals and greenhouse gas emissions of CH4 and N2O resulting from the management of land, forests and biomass during the period from 2021 to 2030. It contributes to the previous Union’s emission reduction target of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990, by ensuring that the sum of total emissions does not exceed the sum of total removals generated by the sector after the application of the accounting rules and of the flexibility with the “effort sharing” (or ESR) sector set out by Regulation (EU) 2018/842. The LULUCF Regulation primarily addresses Member States by establishing a minimum level of climate mitigation performance in the LULUCF sector; it does not set any reporting or compliance requirements for individual land managers. Under the current LULUCF rules, the minimum amount of removals that the LULUCF sector should provide at the EU level in 2030 is around -225 MtCO2eq. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The ‘Fit for 55’ package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. As part of this package, this proposal aims to make the LULUCF Regulation fit for reaching at least 55% net greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 compared to 1990, in line with the 2030 Climate Target Plan, as a staging post to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to amend the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation to provide stronger incentives for Member States to increase and enhance their natural carbon sinks, in line with EU climate law. The proposed amendment introduces only minor and non-substantive changes to the LULUCF regulatory framework for the first compliance period, i.e. from 2021 to 2025. In contrast, new targets for increased net carbon removals are foreseen for the period 2026-2030. To this end, the proposal: - sets out the overall Union target of net greenhouse gas removals in the LULUCF sector to 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030; - reinforces the obligation for Member States to submit integrated mitigation plans for the land sector and enhances the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions and removals using digital technologies; - aligns the objectives with related policy initiatives of biodiversity and bioenergy; - determines the Union target of climate neutrality for 2035 in the land sector (which combines the LULUCF sector and the non-CO2 agricultural sector); - commits the Commission to make proposals for national contributions to the 2035 target by 2025. Commitments to climate neutrality in 2035 From 2031 onwards , the LULUCF sector will include the non-CO2 emissions from agriculture sector and the amended Regulation will aim towards the objective to achieve climate neutrality in the Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the combined sectors at the latest by 2035; reducing emissions to net zero by that date and generating negative emissions thereafter. The Member States are obliged to contribute to reach the collective target and need to present how they intend to achieve this objective in their updated integrated national energy and climate plans by June 2024. In view of the submitted plans, the Commission will propose, by the end of 2025, individual Member State targets and EU-wide measures for the post-2030 period. From 2036 onwards , the combined sector will need to generate further carbon removals to balance remaining emissions in other sectors, based on a robust carbon removal certification system. This policy framework could start to progressively combine the land sector with other sectors (beyond agriculture) that have exhausted their emissions reduction possibilities, or that have achieved for instance over 90% emission reductions. Thus, an incentive to steadily increase carbon removals in the combined sectors for period up to 2050 would be preserved. Flexibility rules The current LULUCF Regulation already provides Member States with several flexibility and trading options to exclude extreme emissions due to natural disturbances, such as forest fires, or unforeseen variations in harvesting rates. The proposal adapts those flexibility rules for the period from 2026 to 2030 and improves them, with a view to offering higher compensation in duly justified cases."
2454EP9,"""""Type approval of motor vehicles (Real Driving Emissions)""""",0.968,0.912,0.892,0.397,0.421,0.815,0.896,0.732,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish rules on motor vehicle emissions in order to control the emissions of motor vehicles to achieve the fundamental air quality objectives. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 requires new light-duty vehicles to comply with certain emission limits (Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards) and lays down additional requirements on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. Successive Euro emission standards have led to very significant drops in emissions of exhaust particles both in terms of mass (PM) and in terms of numbers (PN) and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). However, NOx emissions--and in particular nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions--from road transport have not been reduced as much as expected with the introduction of Euro standards since 1991. To deal with high on-road emissions from passenger vehicles, where a significant discrepancy with the laboratory testing was observed in recent years, the Commission developed the Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure, which applies from 1 September 2017. In December 2018, the Court annulled certain provisions of EU legislation relating to emissions tests under real driving conditions. In its judgment, the General Court did not question the technical necessity of the compliance factors, but considered that the Commission had exceeded its implementing powers by setting the RDE compliance factors under the comitology procedure and not under the ordinary legislative procedure. It therefore cancelled the part of Regulation (EU) 2016/646 that establishes the compliance factors. The annulment is of a partial nature and the RDE test procedure remains in force and must still be conducted at type-approval. To avoid legal uncertainty on the type approvals already granted since 1 September 2017, the General Court delays the effects of the annulment by a maximum period of 12 months, (i.e. 23 February 2020) to give time to the Commission to implement the judgment. The need to adopt the current proposal results directly from the Judgement of the General Court and its swift adoption is vital in order to avoid legal uncertainty on the type approvals already granted since 1 September 2017 as well as on the future type-approvals. CONTENT: in response to a ruling by the General Court, the Commission proposes to reinsert certain aspects of Real Driving Emissions testing (RDE) into legislation to be adopted by the European Parliament and Council. In doing so, the Commission aims to provide legal certainty to national authorities, industry and consumers. In order to avoid imposing an undue burden on manufacturers who have already designed their vehicles taking into account the previously adopted RDE procedure, the Commission proposes to reinsert the conformity factors for new car models of 2.1 until 2020 and the already revised technical margin of error of 1.43 after 2020 through the legislative procedure requested by the General Court. The Commission has kept the conformity factors unaltered in order to ensure stability for national authorities and the automotive sector. In addition, the Commission also proposes that the legislator empowers the Commission to annually review downwards the conformity factors set out by the legislator, in order to reflect the progress in accuracy of the portable measuring equipment. This will allow to gradually reduce even further the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) under real driving."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: the evaluation of Directive 91/533/EEC on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship (""Written Statement Directive"") has highlighted weaknesses in the scope of the Directive and indicated how its effectiveness could be improved. This Directive no longer corresponds to the evolution of the labour market, in particular as regards the new ""non-standard"" forms of employment which have appeared in the last ten years. Since 2014, more than five million jobs have been created, of which almost 20% in new forms of employment. The adaptability of new forms of employment to changes in the economic context has enabled new business models to develop, including in the collaborative economy, and has offered entry into the labour market to people who previously would have been excluded. In response some Member States have put in place new regulations and national social partners have developed new collective agreements, leading to an increasingly diverse regulatory system across the EU. This initiative is one of Commission's key actions to follow up on the European Pillar of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017. It also responds to the resolution of the European Parliament of 19 January 2017 requesting a framework Directive on decent working conditions in all forms of employment, and of 4 July 2017 on working conditions and precarious employment, calling for a revision of the 1991 Directive to take account of new forms of employment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred combination of measures shows that a substantial improvement of working and living conditions is expected. Most notably, at least 2-3 million non-standard workers will enter into the scope of the Directive. Enhanced predictability for some 4-7 million workers should have a positive impact on work-life balance and health. Some 14 million workers might request a new form of work. Lack of exclusivity clauses will allow some 90 000-360 000 on-demand workers to seek additional work and earn EUR 355-1 424 million per year extra. Non-quantified benefits for employers include higher retention and loyalty, improved worker relations, fewer complaints and court cases, better resource planning, contributing to an overall increase in productivity. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to replace the 1991 Written Statement Directive with a new instrument that ensures transparency about working conditions for all workers and defines new substantive rights to improve predictability and security of working conditions, particularly for those in precarious employment. The proposal: extends the scope of the Directive to forms of employment which are today often excluded , such as domestic work, casual workers (for instance those carrying out on-demand or intermittent work), short-term employees, domestic workers, platform workers or voucher-based workers. Member States could decide to exclude very short-term assignments of less than 8 hours per month from the scope of the Directive; provides that workers will receive up-to-date and detailed information (paper or electronic) from their first day of work. This information will cover: (i) probation (if any); (ii) training provided by employer; (iii) arrangements and remuneration for overtime; (iv) information on working time for workers on very variable schedules; (v) social security institution where contributions are paid; establishes minimum rights that apply to all workers in the Union : (i) limit the length of probationary periods to 6 months, unless longer is objectively justified; (ii) right to work for other employers, with a ban on exclusivity clauses and restrictions on incompatibility clauses; (iii) right to predictability of work: workers with variable working schedules determined by the employer (i.e. on-demand work) should know in advance when they can be requested to work; (iv) possibility to request a more stable form of employment and to receive a justified written reply (within 1 month; for SME's within 3 months and orally for repeated requests); (v) right to cost-free mandatory training; introduces two alternative procedures for addressing missing information : positive presumptions (if no relevant information supplied, no probation, permanent and/or full time employment relationship); administrative procedure to issue injunction to employer to supply missing information. The proposal also introduces provisions based on existing social acquis on compliance, right to redress, prevention of adverse treatment, burden of proof on dismissal, and penalties are introduced."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation is part of the EU's common visa policy for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Suspension mechanism : the suspension mechanism in Article 1a of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 allows the temporary suspension of the visa exemption for nationals of a third country in certain emergency situations, as a last resort. It can be triggered by any Member State by notifying the Commission that it is confronted, over a six-month period, in comparison with the same period in the previous year or with the last six months prior to the visa liberalisation of that country, with circumstances leading to an emergency situation which the Member State in question cannot remedy on its own. These circumstances are namely a substantial and sudden increase in the number of: nationals of that third country found to be illegally overstaying in the Member State in question; unfounded asylum applications from the nationals of that third country, where such increase is leading to specific pressures on the Member State’s asylum system; rejected readmission applications submitted by the Member State to that third country for its own nationals. The Commission may decide that action is needed, taking into account the consequences of the suspension of the visa exemption for the external relations of the Union and its Member States with the third country concerned, while working in close cooperation with that third country to find alternative long-term solutions. In that case, the Commission has three months from the receipt of the notification to adopt an implementing act temporarily suspending the exemption from the visa requirement for the nationals of the third country concerned, for a period of six months. Before the expiry of this six-month period, the Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council. This report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to transfer the third country in question to the list of visa-required countries (Annex I), and thus to put its citizens permanently under the visa requirement. In such case, the temporary suspension of the visa waiver may be extended by a maximum period of 12 months. Migration crisis : in the context of the current migratory situation in the European Union and of the successful conclusion of several visa liberalisation dialogues with neighbouring countries (Georgia, Ukraine, Kosovo, Turkey), several Member States have questioned whether the existing visa suspension mechanism provides for the necessary flexibility to act in certain situations of urgency. In particular they have argued that: the possible grounds for suspension are too limited, and for instance do not include the failure of a third country to cooperate on readmission of third-country nationals having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the Union or a Member State and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation; the initiative to trigger the suspension mechanism by means of a notification, which in the Regulation lies solely with Member States, should be extended to Commission; the reference periods and the deadlines are too long, which does not allow for a fast reaction in emergency situations. Taking into account the Commission's recent proposals for visa liberalisation of Georgia, Ukraine, Turkey and Kosovo and the recent discussions with Member States, the Commission has decided to present a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to revise the current suspension mechanism. This is the aim of this proposal. CONTENT: the main objective is to strengthen the suspension mechanism by making it easier for Member States to notify circumstances leading to a possible suspension and by enabling the Commission to trigger the mechanism on its own initiative. This proposal for the revision of the suspension mechanism includes the following elements: The definition of the circumstances which Member States can notify to the Commission has been amended to clarify that the suspension mechanism cannot only be used in ""emergency situations, as a last resort"", but more generally in case the visa liberalisation leads to a serious increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications. The reference period for comparing this situation with the situation of the previous year or before visa liberalisation, is shortened from six to two months. It is sufficient for the increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications to be ""substantial"", whereas the increase must currently be ""sudden and substantial"". The grounds for possible suspension which can be notified should include rejected readmission applications for nationals of another third country having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the Union or a Member State and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation. Other salient issues : - the limitation in time (to seven years) of the possibility to compare the current situation with the situation before visa liberalisation is abolished; - the Commission is given the possibility to trigger the suspension mechanism on its own initiative if it has concrete and reliable information of any of the circumstances which Member States can notify or that the third country is – in a more general manner – not cooperating on readmission, in particular where an EU-level readmission agreement has been concluded with that third country. This failure to cooperate can, for instance, consist in: (i) rejecting or not replying to readmission applications, (ii) failing to issue travel documents for the purposes of return within deadlines specified in the agreement or not accepting European travel documents issued following the lapse of deadlines specified in the agreement, (iii) terminating or suspending the agreement. – Where the Commission, after having examined the circumstances notified (or of which it has received concrete and reliable information), decides that action is needed, the deadline for the adoption of the implementing act temporarily suspending the visa exemption for the third country concerned is reduced from three to one month. Territorial provisions : the proposed Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation, nor shall it be bound or subject to its application. The amended Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary process (covering medical, social, economic and ethical issues) and an evidence-based process that independently and objectively assesses a new or existing technology and compares it with other health technologies and / or the current standard of care. Following the adoption of the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive (Directive 2011/24/EU), a voluntary European network of HTAs composed of national HTA agencies or bodies was set up (in 2013) to provide strategic and political guidance to the scientific and technical cooperation at Union-level. While Member States have carried out some joint assessments within the framework of the EU co-funded joint actions, the production of output has been inefficient. Use of the results of the joint actions, including their joint clinical assessments, at Member State-level has remained low. The duplication of assessments on the same health technology by HTA authorities and bodies in different Member States within identical or similar timeframes has not been sufficiently addressed. The European Parliament, in its resolution of 2 March 2017 called on the Commission to propose legislation on a European system for health technology assessment and to harmonise transparent health technology assessment criteria in order to assess the added therapeutic value of medicines. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four policy options were analysed. The preferred option is based on Option 4 (permanent cooperation on common tools, procedures, early dialogues and joint clinical assessments), integrating certain elements of Option 2 (project-based cooperation on HTA activities) as well as some adjustments (e.g. transitional arrangements for Member States and progressive implementation of the product scope for joint clinical assessments). CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to provide the basis for permanent and sustainable cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments of new medicines and certain new medical devices. Its general objectives are to ensure a better functioning of the internal market and to contribute to a high level of protection of human health. The specific objectives are to improve the availability of innovative health technologies for EU patients, to ensure an efficient use of resources and to improve the quality of HTA across th EU, and to improve business predictability. Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas: 1) Joint clinical assessments: these focus on the most innovative health technologies with the most Union-wide and public health impact. These assessments are limited to: medicinal products undergoing the central marketing authorisation procedure, new active substances and existing products for which the marketing authorisation is extended to a new therapeutic indication; and certain classes of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices which have been selected by the Coordination Group set up under the Regulation. Following the end of a transitional period, participation in the assessments and use of the joint clinical assessment reports at Member State level will be mandatory. Member States will continue to carry out non-clinical assessments (e.g. economic, organisational, ethical) of health technologies and make decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 2) Joint scientific consultations : these allow a developer in the development phase of a health technology to seek the advice of HTA authorities and bodies on the data and evidence likely to be required as part of a potential future joint clinical assessment. 3) Identification of emerging health technologies : This exercise will act as a key input for the annual work programmes, helping to identify at an early stage of their development, the health technologies expected to have a major impact on patients. The Coordination Group will fully consult with all relevant interest groups during this exercise. 4) Voluntary cooperation in other areas : this cooperation could include the assessment of health technologies other than medicinal products or medical devices, non-clinical assessments or collaborative assessments of medical devices not subject to common clinical assessments. Lastly, the proposal lays down common implementing rules in order to ensure harmonisation of the way in which Member States carry out clinical assessments. A key objective of these rules will be to ensure that clinical assessments, whether at EU or at Member State level, are carried out in an independent and transparent manner, free from conflicts of interests. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the implementation of the proposal has no impact on the current Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 as the current cooperation on HTA is financed by the Public Health Programme. The financial impact on the EU budget post-2020 will be part of the Commission's proposals for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals setting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and accused persons. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings; (ii) a directive on provisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant proceedings. This measure also forms part of the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child to which the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and UNICEF have contributed. It is presented together with a Commission Recommendation on procedural safeguards for vulnerable persons suspected or accused in criminal proceedings and vulnerable persons subject to European arrest warrant proceedings. By establishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects or accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the trust of Member States in the criminal justice systems of other Member States and can thus help improve mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment to support this proposal. CONTENT : the draft directive aims to: ·  establish procedural safeguards to ensure that children who are suspected or accused in criminal proceedings are able to understand and follow those proceedings; ·  enable such children to exercise their right to a fair trial and to prevent re-offending by children and foster their social integration. The directive will apply to children, meaning persons under the age of 18, subject to criminal proceedings from the time when they become suspected or accused of having committed an offence and until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. Children will have the following procedural guarantees : Right to information : the child should be informed promptly of the rights under the Directive. In proceedings involving children, the urgency principle should be applied to provide a rapid response and protect the best interests of the child. Right to information of the holder of parental responsibility : further complementary safeguards are provided with regard to the information of the holder of parental responsibility or an appropriate adult in order the take into account the specific needs of children provided that this does not prejudice the due course of the criminal proceedings. Right to an individual assessment : such an individual assessment is needed in order to identify the child's specific needs in terms of protection, education, training and re-integration into society, to determine to what extent he or she would need special measures during criminal proceedings. The individual assessment should be carried out at the latest before the indictment. Right to a lawyer : the directive aims to ensure mandatory access to a lawyer for children who are suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. It also provides that children may not waive this right. However, there are exceptions that include certain minor offences in relation to general municipal regulations and minor public order offences. Right to medical examination : if the child is deprived of liberty, the child should have the right to medical examination upon request by the holder of parental responsibility, the appropriate adult or the child's lawyer. If the medical examination of a child leads to the conclusion that the measures envisaged during the criminal proceedings against the child (e.g. questioning of the child, detention) are incompatible with the general mental and physical condition of the child, the competent authorities should take appropriate measures in accordance with national law. Questioning of children: if a child is deprived of liberty, questioning should always be recorded. Such records must be accessible only to the judicial authorities and the parties of the proceedings to ensure their content and context. Right to liberty : in accordance with United Nation’s rules on the rights of the child, any form of deprivation of liberty of children should be a measure of last resort and be for the shortest appropriate period of time. Taking into account these international standards, this Directive sets minimum rules as regards detention. In order to avoid deprivation of liberty for children, competent authorities should take any alternative measures to deprivation of liberty whenever this is in the best interests of the child. Right to specific treatment in case of deprivation of liberty: children in particular should have the right to: (i) maintain regular and meaningful contact with parents, family and friends; (ii) receive appropriate education, guidance and training; (iii) receive medical care; (iv) be kept separately from adults in order to take into account their vulnerability. Right to protection of privacy: children should be judged in the absence of public. In exceptional cases the court may decide that a hearing is held publicly after it has taken due account of the best interests of the child. In order to ensure proper assistance and support of the child during court hearings, the holder of parental responsibility should be present. Right of children to appear in person at the trial: the right to be present at trial applies to any trial aiming at assessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both conviction and acquittal decisions). European arrest warrant proceedings : the proposal applies to children subject to proceedings pursuant to Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA from the time they are arrested in the executing State. The competent authorities in executing Member States shall apply the rights set out in the directive, which will promote mutual trust and mutual recognition."

PROPOSED ACT: the context of this proposal is fourfold. 1. Despite progress in some areas, major environmental challenges remain, as well as opportunities to make the environment more resilient to systemic risks and change. 2. The EU has adopted the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, which guides policy development for the period up to 2020. 3. While many Member States are struggling to cope with the economic crisis, the need for structural reforms offers new opportunities for the EU to move towards an inclusive green economy. 4. Rio+20 highlighted the importance of the global dimension. Environment Action Programmes (EAP) have guided the development of EU environment policy since the early 1970s. The 6th EAP expired in July 2012. The final assessment of 6th EAP concluded that the programme delivered benefits for the environment and provided an overarching strategic direction for environment policy. Despite those achievements, unsustainable trends still persist in all four priority areas identified in the 6th EAP: (i) climate change, (ii) biodiversity, (iii) environment and health, and (iv) sustainable use of natural resources and management of waste. The Commission sees it as essential that Union priority objectives for 2020 are established, in light of a long-term vision for 2050. The new programme should build on policy initiatives in the Europe 2020 strategy, including the EU climate and energy package, the Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050, the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the Roadmap to a resource-efficient Europe and the Innovation Union Flagship Initiative. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment found that the proposal would add value in a number of ways: (i) by providing a strategic framework for environmental policy in the EU; (ii) by ensuring complementarity and coherence; (iii) by ensuring predictability and a level playing field; and (iv) by stimulating action at all levels of governance. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the new EAP aims to step up the contribution of environment policy to the transition towards a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy in which natural capital is protected and enhanced, and the health and well-being of citizens is safeguarded. The programme provides an overarching framework for environment policy to 2020, identifying nine priority objectives for the EU and its Member States to attain: to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital; to turn the Union into a resource-efficient, green and competitive low-carbon economy; to safeguard the Union's citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and wellbeing; to maximise the benefits of the Union's environment legislation; to improve the evidence base for environment policy; to secure investment for environment and climate policy and get the prices right; to improve environmental integration and policy coherence; to enhance the sustainability of the Union's cities; to increase the Union’s effectiveness in confronting regional and global environmental challenges. The programme shall be based on the polluter-pays principle, the precautionary principle and preventive action, and the principle of rectification of pollution at source. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the programme in this proposal for a Decision has been developed in line with the Commission proposal for the EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 is put forward in the context of the Commission’s REFIT programme and commitment on better regulation. The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission confirmed their joint commitment to updating and simplifying legislation in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. Repealing such legislation keeps the legislative framework transparent, clear and easy to use. Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 was adopted to ensure that the EU’s energy policy develops in an effective way and responds to the EU’s real needs. This Regulation was supported by Commission implementing Regulation (EU) No 1113/2014. Together, these regulations required the Member States to notify the Commission of investment projects for which construction or decommissioning work has started or for which a final investment decision has been taken. Member States have gone through three reporting exercises (2011, 2013 and 2015) since the obligations under this Regulation and its predecessor, Council Regulation No 617/2010, have been in place. In 2016, the Commission carried out the review of Regulation (EU) No 256/2014, including a stakeholder consultation covering all planning and reporting obligations in the energy sector. It concluded that: there were significant overlaps between reporting obligations under Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 and the reporting obligations to the Energy Transmission System Operators ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G; the quality and appropriateness of the information and data received were often poor, and that this information and data had become available to the Commission via other sources. Furthermore, it was noted that the Commission had direct access to market data via its Energy Market Observation System (EMOS). Considering that Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 has therefore not delivered the expected results, the Commission proposes to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union, replacing Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) Nº 736/96."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Competitiveness Council Conclusions of 25 May 2010 confirmed that improving access to up-to-date and trustworthy information on companies could encourage greater confidence in the market, help recovery and increase the competitiveness of European business. Business registers play an essential role in this regard. Cross-border access to business information requires the cross-border cooperation among business registers. The High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens was fully in support of achieving interoperability between trade registers throughout Europe. The interconnection of business registers is one of the proposals in the Communication on the Single Market Act that aim to create a more business-friendly legal and fiscal environment and can also contribute to the agenda Europe 2020 by improving confidence in the single market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the issues around the interconnection of business registers were grouped in three sections: lack of up-to-date business information in the register of foreign branches : the impact assessment concludes that EU legislation should lay down a legal requirement for registers to cooperate by electronic means with regard to updating the registration of foreign branches and the Commission should determine the technical details of such cooperation in a delegated act. difficulties of cooperation between registers in cross-border merger and seat transfer procedures : EU legislation should delegate powers to the Commission to determine the technical details in cross-border merger and seat transfer procedures in a delegated act; difficult cross-border access to business information : in this respect, the best option to: (i) improve the existing situation would be for EU law to lay down a requirement for Member States to participate in an electronic network of registers; (ii) determine the list of information to be transmitted through the network; (iii) determine the frequency of updating the registered information and that the Commission should determine the technical details of the cooperation in a delegated act. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50(2)(g) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the amendments proposed to Directives 89/666/EEC, 2005/56/EC and 2009/101/EC aim to: facilitate cross-border access to official business information by setting up an electronic network of registers and determining a common minimum set of up-to-date information to be made available to third parties by electronic means in every Member State; ensure that the business register of a company provides up-to-date information on the status of the company to the business register of foreign branches all across Europe; improve a cooperation framework between business registers in cross-border merger procedures. More specifically, the proposal aims to makes sure that the documents and particulars in the Member States' business registers are always up to date. They have to make sure that the registered data is updated within 15 calendar days after the underlying change occurs. In order to comply with this requirement, Member States have to ensure that the companies file the relevant changes on time and the change is registered without delay; introduce a unique identifier for all European limited-liability companies that would facilitate their identification at the European level and would allow for easier identification between companies and their foreign branches. Such an identifier could also be used by other registers identifying, for example, listed companies, financial institutions or multinational groups; improve cross-border access to a common minimum set of registered business information by requiring Member States to make the documents and particulars listed in the proposed Directive and registered under the Directive's requirements available through a single European electronic platform, e.g. a central web-service that allows search in all EU business registers. This proposal is complementary to the e-Justice project and should contribute to easier access to business information through the portal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications on the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid ""in beneficiary countries"", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the DCI and on the parallel proposal amending the EIDHR."
3330EP7,"""""Jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters""""",0.684,0.832,0.737,0.452,0.333,0.819,0.779,0.4,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to recast Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (""Brussels I""). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation Brussels I is the basis for civil judicial cooperation in the EU. It applies in a broad range of matters, covering not only contractual but also delict and proprietary claims. It identifies the most appropriate jurisdiction for solving a cross-border dispute and ensures the smooth recognition and enforcement of judgments issued in another Member State. While the Regulation is overall considered to work successfully, the consultation of stakeholders and a number of studies revealed deficiencies in the current operation of the Regulation which should be remedied. Essentially, four main shortcomings can be identified: the procedure for recognition and enforcement of a judgment in another Member State (""exequatur"") remains an obstacle to the free circulation of judgments. It entails unnecessary costs and delays for the parties involved and deters companies and citizens from making full use of the internal market; access to justice in the EU is overall unsatisfactory in disputes involving defendants from outside the EU. With some exceptions, the current Regulation only applies where the defendant is domiciled within the EU. Otherwise jurisdiction is governed by national law. The diversity of national law leads to unequal access to justice for EU companies in transactions with partners from third countries: some can easily litigate in the EU, others cannot, even in situations where no other court guaranteeing a fair trial is competent. In addition, where national legislation does not grant access to court in disputes with parties outside the EU, the enforcement of mandatory EU law protecting e.g. consumers, employees or commercial agents is not guaranteed; the efficiency of choice of court agreements needs to be improved. Currently, the Regulation obliges the court designated by the parties in a choice of court agreement to stay proceedings if another court has been seised first. This rule enables litigants acting in bad faith to delay the resolution of the dispute in the agreed forum by first seizing a non-competent court. This possibility creates additional costs and delays and undermines the legal certainty and predictability of dispute resolution; the interface between arbitration and litigation needs to be improved. Arbitration is excluded from the scope of the Regulation. However, by challenging an arbitration agreement before a court, a party may effectively undermine the arbitration agreement and create a situation of inefficient parallel court proceedings which may lead to irreconcilable resolutions of the dispute. This leads to additional costs and delays, undermines the predictability of dispute resolution and creates incentives for abusive litigation tactics. LEGAL BASE: Article 81 (2) (a), (c) and (e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed the costs and benefits of the main aspects of the proposed reform in its Impact Assessment which accompanies the proposal. CONTENT: the objective of the proposal is to remove the remaining obstacles to the free movement of judicial decisions in line with the principle of mutual recognition. The proposed elements of the reform are as follows: Abolition of the intermediate procedure for the recognition and enforcement of judgments (exequatur): today, judicial cooperation and the level of trust among Member States has reached a degree of maturity which permits the move towards a simpler, less costly, and more automatic system of circulation of judgments, removing the existing formalities among Member States. The proposal therefore abolishes the exequatur procedure for all judgments covered by the Regulation's scope with the exception of judgments in defamation and compensatory collective redress cases. The abolition of exequatur will be accompanied by procedural safeguards which ensure that the defendant's right to a fair trial and his rights of defence are adequately protected. The proposal outlines remedies available to a defendant to enable him to prevent, in exceptional circumstances, a judgment given in one Member State taking effect in another Member State. These safeguards address the situations which are currently addressed by certain of the existing refusal grounds, in particular in order to ensure the protection of the rights of the defence, with the key difference that control of substantive public policy is abolished. As such, the time and costs of the exequatur procedure will be saved while the protection of defendants is ensured. The proposal also contains a series of standard forms which aim at facilitating the recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment in the absence of the exequatur procedure as well as the application for a review under the procedure safeguarding the rights of defence. These forms will facilitate the enforcement of the judgment by the competent authorities, in particular where interest and costs have to be calculated. They also reduce the need for a translation of the judgment and ease the application for a review of the judgment by the defendant who has to act in another Member State. Extension of the jurisdiction rules of the Regulation to disputes involving third country defendants: this amendment will generally extend the ability of companies and citizens to sue third country defendants in the EU because the special rules of jurisdiction which e.g. establish jurisdiction at the place of contractual performance become available in these cases. More specifically, the amendment will ensure that the protective jurisdiction rules available for consumers, employees and insured will also apply if the defendant is domiciled outside the EU. The proposal further harmonises the subsidiary jurisdiction rules and creates two additional fora for disputes involving defendants domiciled outside the EU: it provides that a non-EU defendant can be sued at the place where moveable assets belonging to him are located provided their value is not disproportionate to the value of the claim and that the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court seised; the courts of a Member State will be able to exercise jurisdiction if no other forum guaranteeing the right to a fair trial is available and the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State concerned (""forum necessitatis""). The proposal introduces a discretionary lis pendens rule for disputes on the same subject matter and between the same parties which are pending before the courts in the EU and in a third country. A court of a Member State can exceptionally stay proceedings if a non-EU court was seised first and it is expected to decide within a reasonable time and the decision will be capable of recognition and enforcement in that Member State. This amendment aims at avoiding parallel proceedings within and outside the EU. Enhancement of the effectiveness of choice of court agreements : the proposal includes two amendments with this in mind: where the parties have designated a particular court to resolve their dispute, the proposal gives priority to the chosen court to decide on its jurisdiction, regardless of whether it is first or second seised. Any other court has to stay proceedings until the chosen court has established or – in case the agreement is invalid – declined jurisdiction; the proposal introduces a harmonised conflict of law rule on the substantive validity of choice of court agreements, thus ensuring a similar outcome on this matter whatever the court seised. Improvement of the interface between the Regulation and arbitration : the proposal obliges a court seised of a dispute to stay proceedings if its jurisdiction is contested on the basis of an arbitration agreement and an arbitral tribunal has been seised of the case or court proceedings relating to the arbitration agreement have been commenced in the Member State of the seat of the arbitration. This modification will enhance the effectiveness of arbitration agreements in Europe, prevent parallel court and arbitration proceedings, and eliminate the incentive for abusive litigation tactics. Better coordination of proceedings before the courts of Member States : the proposal contains the following provisions: it aims at improving the general lis pendens rule by prescribing a time limit for the court first seised to decide on its jurisdiction. In addition, the amendment provides for an exchange of information between the courts seised of the same matter; it facilitates the consolidation of related actions by doing away with the requirement that consolidation has to be possible under national law; regarding provisional, and protective measures, the proposal provides for the free circulation of those measures which have been granted by a court having jurisdiction on the substance of the case, including – subject to certain conditions – measures which have been granted ex parte. By contrast, the proposal prevents the circulation of provisional measures ordered by a court other than the one having jurisdiction on the substance. Given the wide divergence of national law on this issue, the effect of these measures should be limited to the territory of the Member State where they were granted, thereby preventing the risk of abusive forum-shopping; if proceedings on the substance are pending in one court and another one is asked to issue a provisional measure, the proposal requires the two courts to cooperate in order to ensure that all circumstances of the case are taken into account when a provisional measure is granted. Improvement of access to justice for certain specific disputes: provisions include: the creation of a forum for claims of rights in rem at the place where moveable assets are located; the possibility for employees to bring actions against multiple defendants in the employment area. This will benefit employees who wish to bring proceedings against joint employers established in different Member States; the possibility of concluding a choice of court agreement for disputes concerning the tenancy of premises for professional use, and the mandatory information of a defendant entering an appearance about the legal consequences of not contesting the court's jurisdiction. and clarification of the conditions under which provisional and protective measures can circulate in the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the report on the ‘European Environment - State and Outlook 2020’, presented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on 4 December 2019, identified the unprecedented scale and urgency of the environmental, climate and sustainability challenges facing Europe today. These challenges require immediate and concerted action and urgent systemic solutions. The European Commission has responded to these challenges by adopting the ‘European Green Deal’, which aims to make the EU the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Following the debate on the communication ‘A clean planet for all’, in March 2020 the EU presented its long-term strategy under the Paris agreement on climate change, committing the EU to becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050. The Commission has proposed enshrining this target in EU climate law. In response to the coronavirus crisis, the ‘Next Generation EU recovery plan’ proposed by the European Commission on 27 May 2020 and endorsed by the Extraordinary European Council of July 2020 underlines the importance of the European Green Deal. As a follow-up to the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) which shall expire on 31 December 2020, the Commission is presenting a proposal for an 8th EAP, with a long-term vision and priority environmental objectives to support the EU's common commitment to achieve a green recovery. CONTENT: the proposal for a decision establishes a general action programme in the field of the environment for the period up to 31 December 2030 to accelerate the Union's transition towards a climate-neutral, clean, resource-efficient and circular economy in a fair and inclusive manner. The 8th EAP shall support the environment and climate action objectives of the European Green Deal in line with the long-term objective to ‘live well, within the planetary boundaries’ by 2050, which is already established in the 7th EAP. It shall contribute to achieving the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. Priority objectives The proposed 8th EAP sets thematic priority objectives in the areas of climate neutrality, adaptation to climate change, protection and restoration of biodiversity, aiming at zero pollution and reducing the pressures of production and consumption on the environment. It also sets out the conditions for achieving the long-term objectives and priority thematic objectives for all actors involved. Monitoring framework One of the key actions of the 8th EAP, announced by the European Green Deal, is a new monitoring framework to measure the progress made by the EU and its Member States in implementing the programme's priority objectives. The 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide the environment and climate input to the EU’s overall efforts to measure progress towards sustainability and shall inform policy makers and stakeholders if the Union and the Member States are on track to achieving a systemic transformation. The process to develop an 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide an opportunity to explore the potential of the ongoing workstream on the planetary boundaries (e.g. freshwater use, land use change, ocean acidification) and on the Union consumption footprint, including deforestation and forest degradation in third countries. Key indicators The 8th EAP monitoring framework should comprise a limited number of key indicators for high-level communication, which tell a coherent story about the state of the environment, the main pressures and the effectiveness of our response. On the basis of a consultation process with the other EU institutions, Member States and stakeholders, the Commission intends to present a set of key indicators for the 8th EAP by the end of 2021. Budgetary implications This proposal has been developed in line with the Commission proposal for the EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. It introduces the need for additional resources in the European Environment Agency (EEA) and in the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in supporting the new monitoring, measuring and reporting framework of this Programme. The estimated impact on operational expenditure for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 23.379 million for the EEA and EUR 2.369 million for ECHA. It is expected that Heading 3 of the MFF ‘Natural Resources and Environment’ shall maintain neutrality and shall not be impacted by this proposal. The resources needed for the EEA and ECHA shall be deducted from the LIFE budget according to a split of 2/3 of the costs for DG Environment and 1/3 of the costs of DG Climate Action for the EEA, while the resources needed for ECHA shall be fully covered by DG Environment."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission decided that cohesion policy should remain an essential element of the next financial package and underlined its pivotal role in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. It proposed a number of important changes to the way cohesion policy is designed and implemented. Concentrating funding on a smaller number of priorities better linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, focusing on results, monitoring progress towards agreed objectives, increasing the use of conditionalities and simplifying the delivery are among the major hallmarks of the proposal. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). European Territorial Cooperation is one of the goals of cohesion policy and provides a framework for the implementation of joint actions and policy exchanges between national, regional and local actors from different Member States. This is all the more important given that the challenges faced by Member States and regions increasingly cut across national /regional boundaries and require joint, co-operative action at the appropriate territorial level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t he options assessed in the impact assessment relate to the improvement of the strategic focus and of the coordination between cooperation and regional programmes. The options considered included: the continuation of the status quo (broad priorities, no formal link between cooperation and regional programmes), a scenario focused on thematic concentration and integration of cooperation in overall strategic framework (limited number of thematic objectives that cross-border and transnational programmes can choose, integration of cooperation aspects in Common Strategic Framework and Partnership Contract); a scenario that would fully integrate cooperation aspects in the regional programmes without the need for separate cooperation programmes. The second option was chosen as the preferred one since it will ensure a better focus on European priorities, strengthen the programme intervention logic and ensure a better link and coherence with regional programmes. LEGAL BASIS: Article 178 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: a separate regulation is proposed for European Territorial Cooperation to take better account of multi-country context of the programmes and make more specific provisions for cooperation programmes and operations, as has been requested by a large number of stakeholders. The proposal also: establishes the scope of the European Regional Development Fund with regard to the European Territorial Cooperation goal; defines the priority objectives and organisation of the ERDF, eligibility criteria, financial resources available and criteria for their allocation sets the implementation arrangements, including provisions for financial management and control. The Common Provisions Regulation and the ERDF regulation both apply subject to the specific provisions contained in this regulation. The proposal also includes the continuation of the mechanism for the transfer of resources for cooperation activities at the external borders of the Union, to be supported under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. Synergies and complementarity between programmes under the European Territorial Cooperation goal and programmes financed under external instruments shall be promoted. New element : a new element in the proposal is the provisions on thematic concentration and investment priorities. This is to be seen in the overall context of improving the strategic focus of programmes and their results orientation. Programmes will also contain a performance framework defining programme-specific milestones against which progress in implementation can be assessed. The 2007-2013 programming period has seen the emergence of new forms of territorial cooperation, tailor-made responses to address macro-regional challenges. At the request of the European Council, two macro-regional strategies have been prepared by the Commission for the Baltic Sea and the Danube Regions respectively. The proposed regulation explicitly foresees that transnational cooperation can also support the development and implementation of macro-regional strategies and sea-basin programmes (including the ones established on the external borders of the EU). The implementation modalities have been streamlined for cooperation programmes. The number of authorities involved in programme implementation has been reduced and roles and responsibilities further clarified. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund). In the proposed Regulation, the resources provides for European territorial cooperation are broken down as follows: 73.24% (i.e., a total of EUR 8 569 000 003) for cross-border cooperation; 20.78% (i.e., a total of EUR 2 431 000 001) for transnational cooperation; 5.98% (i.e., a total of EUR 700 000 000) for interregional cooperation.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that affect normal activity of the competent authorities in the Member States and the work of transport undertakings as regards the administrative formalities to be completed in different transport sectors that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of the relevant measures. Those extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on various areas covered by Union transport law. In particular, transport operators and other persons concerned may not be able to complete the necessary formalities or procedures to comply with certain provisions of Union law related to the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations or to complete other steps necessary to maintain their validity. This is the case, for instance, with driving licences, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers, Community licences and driver attestations for the provisions of road haulage services, rail single safety certificates or authorisations, boatmasters’ certificates or port security assessments etc. It is most likely that those certificates, licences, authorisations which, in accordance with Union law, would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 could not be renewed in due time. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt temporary provisions extending the validity of those certificates, licences or authorisations that would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and ensure that they remain valid during a reasonable period of time during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down specific and temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in response to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the area of road, rail and inland waterways transport and maritime security. This proposal concerns specific provisions that affect the application of several Directives and Regulations:  Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which (lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses with the objective to ensure safety on European roads). Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (provides for the mutual recognition of the driving licences issued by Member States based on a Union model driving licence). Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (defines the harmonised minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness testing). Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator). Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lay down common rules for access to the international road haulage market and the international market for coach and bus services, respectively). Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/798 (regulate safety certification and authorisation in the Union). Directive 2007/59/EC of the European Parliament (lays down rules on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union). Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (establishes a single European railway area). Directive 96/50/EC (lays down conditions for obtaining boatmasters’ certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union). Directive (EU) 2016/1629 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels). Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down rules on ship and port facility security). Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down measures to enhance port security in the face of threats of security incidents). This Regulation should be adopted as a matter of urgency, so that situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors, in particular where the relevant time limits have already expired, remain as short as possible."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes a common system for the control of exports of dual-use items in accordance with the international commitments and obligations of the Member States and the EU. Under this regulation, an authorisation is required for the export of dual-use items to third countries. This authorisation may take the form of an individual, global or general authorisation. In particular, Annex IIa to the Regulation provides for a Union General Export Authorisation (“EU001”) for certain low-risk transactions, e.g. exports to Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland (incl. Liechtenstein), and the United States of America. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU has consequences for trade in dual-use items between the EU and the UK: under Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, the export of dual-use items from the EU to the UK will, as from 1 January 2021, require an export authorisation issued by the national competent authority of the Member State where the exporter is established. This would create a considerable administrative burden for the competent authorities of the Member States and for EU exporters, which would be detrimental to their competitiveness. CONTENT: in order to avoid disproportionate trade disruptions and an excessive administrative burden for exports of dual-use items from the EU to the UK, it is proposed to add the UK to Annex IIa of the Regulation and thus to control exports to the UK under EU General Export Authorisation No EU001. The addition of the United Kingdom to the list of countries covered by EU General Export Authorisation EU001 should not have a negative impact on EU and international security, while ensuring uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the Union and ensuring a level playing field for EU exporters. This proposal is consistent with the general approach to contingency measures to address a withdrawal of the United Kingdom without agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid ""in beneficiary countries"", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the EIDHR and on the parallel proposal amending the DCI."
6718EP7,"""""Food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health, plant reproductive material and plant protection products""""",0.895,0.769,0.947,0.452,0.273,0.675,0.749,0.714,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down a harmonised approach governing the performance of official controls to ensure the uniform application of the agri-food chain rules across the EU. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to afford European Union (EU) citizens a high level of human, animal and plant health, and guarantee the functioning of the internal market, Union legislation provides for a set of harmonised rules to prevent, eliminate or reduce the level of health risk to humans, animals and plants, which may arise along the 'agri-food chain’. To ensure that this extensive set of rules is enforced by the Member States (MS) across the EU in a harmonised manner, a legislative framework for the organisation of official controls has been established through Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. Based on an extensive review of the provisions of the Regulation, the Commission proposes revising the legislation on official controls to overcome shortcomings identified in its wording and in its application. The aim is to simplify and clarify the system and to establish a single framework applicable to all official controls along the entire food chain. The proposal replaces and repeals Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and a number of sectoral acts and provisions which will be made redundant by its adoption. It is part of a comprehensive package that also includes three major reviews to modernise the animal health, plant health and plant reproductive material acquis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the retained option was that which involves: (i) streamlining the legislative framework; (ii) integrating within the Regulation’s scope plant health, plant reproductive material (PRM) and animal by-products (ABP); and (iii) extending mandatory fees to cover all controls performed. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 43(2), 114 and 168(4)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to modernise and sharpen enforcement tools, and in particular official controls, as laid down in the existing Regulation, to simplify the legislative framework. It lays down harmonised rules at EU level aimed at providing a comprehensive and coherent approach to official controls along the entire agri-food chain. Scope: it is proposed to integrate the rules currently applicable to official controls in specific areas currently governed by separate sets of rules (e.g. controls on residues of veterinary medicinal products in live animals and animal products, and plant health controls) into the framework of a single Regulation. Lightening administrative burdens: the proposal makes changes in a number of situations where it is possible to alleviate the burden of organising and implementing official controls by eliminating redundant requirements (e.g. separate reporting from official controls on residues of veterinary medicinal products) or allowing a proportionate and flexible approach to some specific situations (e.g. not requiring full accreditation of official laboratories in case of emergencies). Sampling: requirements on methods of sampling and of laboratory analysis, testing and diagnosis will become applicable to official controls and to other official activities in all the sectors covered by the Regulation (e.g. to surveillance, monitoring and survey activities in the plant health and animal health sectors). A 5 years transitional period will thus be foreseen for the plant health and plant propagating material sectors. The rules for the choice of the method to be used by the official laboratory will be clarified and extended so as to require that methods meet state-of-the-art scientific standards. Official controls on animals and goods entering the Union: as far as imports are concerned, it is essential that all foodstuffs available on the EU market are safe. The proposal includes therefore a set of common and comprehensive rules applicable to controls performed on animals and goods from third countries. Border Control Posts (BCPs) will replace the different entities currently tasked with border control duties. A Common Health Entry Document (CHED) will be used (i) by operators for the mandatory prior notification of arrival of consignments of animals and goods and (ii) by competent authorities to record controls on such consignments and any decisions taken. Financing of official controls: Member States will be required to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to provide the staff and other resources necessary to the competent authorities to perform official controls and the other activities referred to in the Regulation. The proposal maintains the system of mandatory fees and extends it to most official controls. Micro-enterprises will be exempted from the payment of such fees. Administrative assistance and cooperation: the administrative assistance and cooperation provisions of the Regulation will be reinforced and clarified so as to increase their usability and effectiveness as a tool for tackling cross-border non-compliances. The proposal envisages the creation of an integrated information management system for official controls, which will allow the integrated operation and updating of all existing and future computerised systems through which information, data and documents regarding official controls are exchanged among competent authorities, and with the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not imply incurring any expenditure which is not already foreseen in the financial statement of the common financial framework. No additional human resources are envisaged either. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal includes provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72 of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72 on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and Iceland. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main provisions codified : an Agreement between the European Economic Community and Iceland was signed in Brussels on 22 July 1972. Detailed rules are necessary for implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures provided for in the Agreement. The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the Agreement requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard measures. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to situations referred to in the proposal (notably in the case of export aids that have a direct and immediate effect on trade, imperative grounds of urgency so require). It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EEC) No 2843/72"

BACKGROUND: while emissions from other sectors are generally falling, road transport is one of the few sectors where emissions have risen rapidly. Between 1990 and 2008 emissions from road transport increased by 26%. As a result, it is the second biggest source of GHG emissions in the EU, and contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of CO2. In March 2011 the Commission adopted the 'Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system'. It sets out a transport strategy within a frame of achieving a 60% reduction in transport GHG emissions by 2050. Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 sets the CO2 reduction framework for the new van fleet to 2020. It operates in two steps. In the first period to 2017 the modalities of compliance with the targets have been established. For the second period to 2020 the target cannot become effective without implementing the necessary modalities, which are to be determined in a review. The Commission is requested to confirm that the 2020 van target is feasible. Failure to determine or implement the modalities would have a detrimental effect on vehicle manufacturers and parts suppliers who need certainty with regard to the technology and vehicles that will be needed to meet the target. Key modalities in the current Regulation include the limit value curve which is defined by the utility parameter and the function describing the relationship between the utility parameter and CO2 emissions (setting the shape and slope). Other modalities include the excess emissions premium scheme, eco-innovations, derogations, pooling, the phasing-in of the targets and granting of super-credits for a limited period of time. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a joint impact assessment supporting the current proposal and a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 has been prepared. The following aspects were analysed: (a) 'do nothing' option; (b) modalities of meeting the car target; (c) simplification and reduction of administrative burden; (d) adaptation to the new test cycle; (e) form and stringency of legislation beyond 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal confirms the feasibility of the average target of 147 g CO2/km for new light commercial vehicles to be reached in 2020. It proposes to define the modalities of reaching the target as follows: · the utility parameter continues to be vehicle's mass in running order · the limit value curve remains linear with a slope of 100% compared to the baseline fleet ; · manufacturers responsible for less than 500 registrations of new light commercial vehicles per year are excluded from the obligation to meet their specific emissions target; · more flexibility is allowed in the timing of decisions granting small-volume derogations ; · eco-innovations are retained when a revised test procedure is implemented ; · excess Emissions Premium is maintained at €95 per g/km per vehicle. As industry benefits from indications of the regulatory regime that would apply beyond 2020, the proposal includes a further review to take place by 31 December 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
5889EP7,"""""Freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime""""",0.404,0.897,0.93,0.645,0.485,0.892,0.892,0.743,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: establish a legal framework on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: at global level, according to United Nations estimates, the total amount of criminal proceeds in 2009 was approximately USD 2.1 trillion, or 3.6% of global GDP. There are no reliable estimates of the size of criminal profits in the European Union, but in Italy the proceeds of organised crime laundered in 2011 have been estimated by the Bank of Italy at EUR 150 billion. The profits derived from these activities are laundered and reinvested into licit activities . Organised crime groups increasingly hide and reinvest assets in Member States other than the one where the crime is committed which weakens our ability to fight cross-border serious and organised crime in the EU as a whole. All Member States should therefore have in place an efficient system to freeze, manage and confiscate criminal assets because, although regulated by EU and national laws, the confiscation of criminal assets remains underdeveloped and underutilised. As an effective tool in the fight against organised and serious crime, confiscation of criminal assets has been given strategic priority at EU level. The 2009 Stockholm Programme calls the Member States and the Commission to make the confiscation of criminal assets more efficient and to strengthen the cooperation between Asset Recovery Offices. In a series of conclusion, the Council has also called on the Commission to consider strengthening the legal framework in order to achieve more effective regimes for third party confiscation and extended confiscation. For its part, the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on organised crime which invites the Commission to present new legislative proposals in the field. It is in this context that the Commission put forward “An Internal Security Strategy in Action” in which it undertook to propose legislation to strengthen the EU legal framework on confiscation, in particular to allow more third-party confiscation and extended confiscation, and to facilitate mutual recognition of non-conviction-based confiscation orders between Member States. Over time, all confiscation and freezing orders issued by a Member State should be effectively enforced against assets located in another Member State. It should be noted that the majority of definitions and certain basic provisions in this proposal for a directive may be found in existing European texts, and in particular: Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA , which obliges Member States to enable confiscation, to allow value confiscation where the direct proceeds of crime cannot be seized and to ensure that requests from other Member States are treated with the same priority as domestic proceedings; Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA , which harmonises confiscation laws; Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA , which provides for mutual recognition of freezing orders; Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA , which provides for the mutual recognition of confiscation orders; and Council Decision 2007/845/JHA on cooperation between national Asset Recovery Offices. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of several policy alternatives that represent differing degrees of EU-level intervention. Option 0: a non-legislative option, Option 1: a minimal legislative option (correcting deficiencies in the existing EU legal framework which inhibit it from functioning as intended) and Option 2: a maximal legislative option (going beyond the aims of the existing EU legal framework). Within the latter, two maximal legislative sub-options are analysed, one with and one without EU level action relating to mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders between Member States. The preferred policy option is the maximal legislative option. This option would considerably enhance the harmonisation of national rules on confiscation and enforcement, inter alia by amending existing provisions on extended confiscation, and introducing new provisions on non-conviction based confiscation and third party confiscation and introducing more effective rules on the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(2) and Article 83 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal for a Directive lays down minimum on the freezing of property with a view to possible later confiscation and on the confiscation of property in criminal matters. The Directive only makes provision for minimum rules (national legislative measures may be more ambitious). The adoption of those minimum rules will further harmonise the Member States' freezing and confiscation regimes, and thus facilitate mutual trust and effective cross-border cooperation. Confiscation : based on the existing provision of the Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA, the proposal provides for the Member States to enable the confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime following a final conviction and to enable the confiscation of property of equivalent value to the proceeds of crime. Extended powers of confiscation : according to the proposal “extended confiscation signifies the ability to confiscate assets which go beyond the direct proceeds of a crime. A criminal conviction may be followed by the (extended) confiscation not only of assets associated with the specific crime, but of additional assets which the court determines are the proceeds of other similar crimes. Extended confiscation powers are already provided for in the EU legislation. Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA obliges Member States to allow the confiscation of assets belonging directly or indirectly to persons convicted of certain serious crimes (related to organised crime and terrorism activities). However, this Framework Decision establishes alternative minimum set of rules for extended confiscation, leaving Member States free to apply one, two or all three options. This proposal introduces extended confiscation for the crimes listed in Article 83(1) TFEU as set out in existing Union legislation. It also streamlines the existing regime of alternative options for extended confiscation, by providing for a single minimum standard. Extended confiscation can take place where a court finds, based on specific facts, that a person convicted of an offence covered by this Directive is in possession of assets which are substantially more probable to be derived from other criminal activities of similar nature or gravity than from any other activities. Extended confiscation is excluded where the similar criminal activities could not be the subject of criminal proceedings due to prescription under national criminal law. The proposal also excludes from confiscation the proceeds of alleged criminal activities for which the affected person has been finally acquitted in a previous trial or other situations where where the ne bis in idem principle applies. Non-conviction based confiscation: this provision introduces provisions on non-conviction based confiscation in limited circumstances, with a view to addressing cases where criminal prosecution cannot be exercised. It accordingly concerns confiscation in relation to a criminal offence, but it allows Member States to choose whether confiscation should be imposed by criminal and/or civil/administrative courts. Non-conviction based procedures allow to freeze and confiscate an asset without a prior conviction of its owner in a criminal court. In order to meet the requirement of proportionality, the proposal would not introduce non-conviction based confiscation in all cases, but makes it possible only in circumstances where a criminal conviction cannot be obtained because the suspect has died, is permanently ill or when his flight or illness prevents effective prosecution within a reasonable time and poses the risk that it could be barred by statutory limitations. Third party confiscation : criminals often transfer their assets to knowing third parties as soon as they come under investigation, in order to avoid confiscation. Third party confiscation involves the confiscation of assets that have been transferred by an investigated or convicted person to third parties. The Member States' national provisions on third party confiscation are diverging. This hampers the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders on assets transferred to a third party. In order to meet the requirements of proportionality and protect the position of a third party acquiring property in good faith, the proposal does not introduce minimum harmonisation provisions on third party confiscation in all cases. This provision requires third party confiscation to be available for the proceeds of crime or other property of the defendant received for a price lower than market value and that a reasonable person in the position of the third party would suspect to be derived from crime or to be transferred in order to circumvent the application of confiscation measures. It clarifies that the reasonable-person-test must be based on concrete facts and circumstances to prevent arbitrary decisions. Moreover, third party confiscation should be possible only following an assessment, based on specific facts, that the confiscation of property of the convicted, suspected or accused person is unlikely to succeed, or in situations where unique objects must be restored to their rightful owner. Freezing : this provision requires Member States to enable the freezing of property or instrumentalities in danger of being dissipated, hidden or transferred out of the jurisdiction in view of possible later confiscation. It clarifies that such measures should be ordered by a court. The introduction of the possibility to use freezing powers in urgent cases in order to prevent asset dissipation in situations where waiting for an order issued by a court would jeopardize the possibilities of freezing is a longstanding priority concern of prosecutors and law enforcement agencies. The second paragraph of this Article requires Member States to have in place measures to ensure that assets in danger of being dissipated, hidden or transferred out of their jurisdiction can be frozen immediately by the competent authorities, prior to seeking a court order or pending its request. Safeguards : according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, fundamental rights such as the right to property are not absolute. They can legitimately be subject to restrictions provided these restrictions are provided for by law and are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others, as in the prevention of organised crime. Inasmuch as freezing or confiscation orders interfere with the right to property or other fundamental rights, they must be capable of challenge by affected parties under the conditions set by this Article. The existing EU legislation (e.g. Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA) provides that Member States should ensure that adequate legal remedies for the affected persons exist in national legislation. With a view to fully complying with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this Article introduces minimum safeguards at EU level. These aim at guaranteeing: the respect of the presumption of innocence , the right to a fair trial (including the ne bis in idem principle), the existence of effective judicial remedies before a court and the right to be informed on how to exercise such remedies. Determination of the extent of the confiscation and effective execution : persons suspected to belong to criminal organisations have proven to be successful in hiding their assets, often with the benefit of advice from skilled professionals. In case a confiscation order was issued, no property or insufficient property was discovered and the confiscation order could not be executed, this Article requires Member States to allow financial investigations on the person's assets to be pursued to the extent necessary to fully execute such order. This provision addresses the problem of the foreclosure of confiscation activities at the end of the criminal procedure and allows unexecuted or partially executed confiscation orders to apply against previously hidden assets which have ""resurfaced"" in the meantime. Management of frozen property : this provision intends to facilitate the management of property frozen in view of possible later confiscation. It requires Member States to introduce measures aimed at ensuring an adequate management of such property, notably by granting powers to realise frozen property, at least where it is liable to decline in value or become uneconomical to maintain. Effectiveness and reporting obligations : this provision introduces reporting obligations for Member States, which would help generate statistics to be used for evaluation purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal will imply no cost for the EU budget. It does not concern the budgetary allocation of the product of confiscation."

Recalling that the EU and Japan have been strategic partners since 2003, Members welcomed the conclusion of the draft Strategic Partnership Agreement, which provides a binding legal framework, strengthens EU-Japan bilateral relations and cooperation in more than 40 areas, as well as to address global issues requiring global cooperation such as climate change, migration, cyber threats, public health, transnational crime, peacebuilding operations, crisis and disaster management and the fight against terrorism. Parliament welcomed the reference to a parliamentary dimension in the agreement, which aims to strengthen the partnership through dialogue and cooperation on political issues, foreign and security policy and other types of sectoral cooperation. Human rights and fundamental freedoms Members reaffirmed the shared commitment to respect for human rights, democracy, fundamental freedoms, good governance and the rule of law, and common values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They called on the Union to enter into a dialogue with the Japanese government with a view to a moratorium on capital punishment and its possible abolition. They also highlighted the need for increased cooperation on women's rights. International and regional relations While welcoming the EU’s new strategy to improve connectivity with Asia, Parliament called for, inter alia: - the expansion of EU-Japan bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation with South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States and China with a view to achieving and maintaining peace and stability in the region, peaceful coexistence on the Korean peninsula and the full, irreversible and verifiable denuclearisation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; - the development of synergies between Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and EU initiatives, including the EU Investment Plan and the extended EU Trans-European Transport Networks, in order to promote global cooperation in connectivity; - the strengthening of educational and cultural dialogue, university mobility programmes under Erasmus+, and public diplomacy with a view to promoting mutual understanding and cultural diversity; - intensifying cooperation in the field of sustainable energy, for example by developing low-emission forms of transport; - the suspension of whaling for scientific purposes and the lifting of Japan's reservations to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); - further exchange of good practices regarding illegal logging; - the exchange of information and cooperation to end cosmetics testing on animals in Japan.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Within the Union, the freedom for the Member States' road haulage operators to provide international carriage of goods by road is regulated primarily on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009, which lay down the common rules for the access to the occupation of road transport operator and for access to the international road haulage market, respectively. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, road freight transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulations upon withdrawal. This would result in the loss of validity of Community licences issued by the United Kingdom to road haulage operators until the withdrawal date, and thereby loss of access to the Union’s road haulage market for holders of such licences. Similarly, European Union road haulage operators, on the basis of the existing Community licences, would equally lose automatic access to the United Kingdom’s road freight transport market. More than 80% of road haulage transport between the United Kingdom and the EU-27 is currently carried out by carriers established in the EU-27. In order to avoid serious disruptions and any risk of disturbing public order, the Commission proposes to adopt temporary emergency measures enabling road haulage operators licensed in the United Kingdom to carry goods by road between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to allow UK operators to temporarily transport goods to the EU for 9 months (until 31 December 2019), provided that the United Kingdom grants equivalent rights to EU road hauliers and subject to the conditions of fair competition. The proposal complements the Union rules regulating the carriage of goods by road, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009. Ensure basic connectivity This proposed act would establish basic connectivity subject to equivalent rights being granted by the United Kingdom. Such connectivity would be ensured in an equal manner for traffic to and from all points in the Union, which avoids distortions in the internal market. The proposed Regulation lays down a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by Union road haulage operators in the United Kingdom are equivalent to those granted to UK road haulage operators under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of delegated acts, including the limitation to the allowable capacity available to UK road haulage operators or to the number of journeys or to both. Fair competition The proposed Regulation, even though it aims to temporarily ensure basic connectivity for road freight transport, lays down a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union road haulage operators enjoy fair and equal opportunities to compete with United Kingdom road haulage operators once the United Kingdom will no longer be bound by Union law. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards in the area of road freight transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers and a high level of road safety; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) granting of licences to road haulage operators or to the qualification, training and medical controls for professional drivers. Moreover, it must be ensured that Union carriers are not discriminated against in the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if the European Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the unprecedented measures put in place by Member States to contain the spread of COVID-19, in particular measures concerning confinement and social distancing of persons, may prevent companies and cooperative societies from complying with their legal obligations under national and Union company law, in particular, by making it considerably difficult for them to hold general meetings. At EU level, European Companies (SEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 and European Cooperative Societies (SCEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003. Both Regulations require a general meeting to be held within six months of the end of the financial year. In view of the current exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary derogation from this requirement should be granted. Many Member States have already allowed the use of digital tools and processes for holding general meetings and have extended the deadlines for holding general meetings in 2020. CONTENT: the holding of the general meeting is essential to ensure that legally binding or economically necessary decisions are taken in a timely manner. Under the draft Council Regulation, SEs and SCEs should be allowed to hold their general meeting within 12 months of the end of the financial year, provided that it takes place no later than 31 December 2020. As this derogation is a temporary measure due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it should only apply to general meetings that are required to be held in 2020. The proposed Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. CONTENT: since 1996, the Commission has been striving to consolidate the European Common Aviation Area or ECAA. To recall, the purpose of the ECAA is to open up markets between Europe and its neighbours and to offer ECAA signatories the benefits of an internal market in the field of aviation. In other words, the ECAA is a multi-lateral agreement offering full market opening in terms of access, capacity, fares and the freedom of establishment without nationality clauses as well as an alignment with Community legislation on safety, security and air-traffic management matters. Initial negotiations from 1996 onwards focused on the then ten applicant countries. Following their accession in May 2004, the Commission’s focus has shifted towards the Balkan region. The text of the multilateral agreement has been accepted by: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the European Community, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Montenegro, Romania and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. Following extensive negotiations these countries have agreed to align their national aviation legislation with that of the EU’s. The Commission suggests that this development acts as a major step forward. In future air transport will play a key role in both the economic and political integration of Europe. Upon adoption of the proposed Council Decisions the existing bilateral air service agreements between the Member States and the ECAA partners will, to a large extent, cease to exist and be substituted by one single Community Agreement. In addition, the the text of the Agreement has been simplified. For instance, competition issues will henceforth be dealt with through the Stabilisation and Association Process. In terms of its structure, a common “multilateral main text” forms the basis of the ECAA. This text will be obligatory to all signatories. A series of Protocols have been added which accommodating the specific need of each country, including appropriate transitional arrangements. Lastly, an Annex lists all of the EU’s aviation acts applicable within the ECAA."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: European society is ageing. Pension systems across the European Union (EU) have to adapt in order to ensure adequate, safe and sustainable pensions. The institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs) sector is being developed in many Member States where occupational pensions so far play a limited role, including by setting up regulatory frameworks. Failing to provide an up-to-date EU regulatory framework now entails the risk that Member States continue to develop diverging solutions, thereby exacerbating regulatory fragmentation. Furthermore, improvements to the performance of occupational pensions require long periods of time to materialise. According to the Commission, a revision of Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision is necessary for the following reasons: (1) protect members and beneficiaries, and facilitate safe cross-border provisioning through higher governance standards reflecting best practices at national level following the economic and financial crisis; (2) reduce the obstacles to develop cross border occupational pensions markets, which would help companies, including SMEs and multinationals, to organise their pension provision on a European scale more efficiently; (3) there is evidence of significant gaps in the level of information provided to scheme members and beneficiaries across the EU. This proposal builds on a number of initiatives launched in recent years such as the White Paper on pensions and the Green Paper on long-term financing of the European economy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment report that considers a range of policy options and sub-options. The report was first submitted to the Impact Assessment Board on 4 September 2013. The Board asked for resubmission with additional information on the views of the different stakeholder groups, problem definition, subsidiarity and proportionality aspects, options and expected impacts. The impact assessment was resubmitted on 16 October 2013. On 6 November the Board stated it could not issue a positive opinion and requested some further amendments. CONTENT: this proposal to recast Directive 2003/41/EC has four specific objectives: 1. Removing remaining prudential barriers for cross-border IORPs , notably by: requiring that the rules on investment and disclosure of information to members and beneficiaries are those of the home Member State, clarifying procedures for cross-border activities, clearly defining the scope of action of home and host Member State. 2. Ensuring good governance and risk management : the proposal: (i) establishes that institutions need to have in place an effective system of governance which provides for sound and prudent management of their activities; (ii) sets out that institutions must have a sound remuneration policy; (iii) provides for an effective internal audit function which evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system; (iv) sets out that IORPs need to appoint a single depositary for safekeeping of assets and oversight duties if members and beneficiaries fully bear the investment risk. 3. Providing clear and relevant information to members and beneficiaries : the proposal places an obligation on IORPs to provide, every twelve months, a pension benefit statement (‘PBS’) for the individual in the clearest possible way, also as a basis to feed information into a potential pension tracking service. 4. Ensuring that supervisors have the necessary tools to effectively supervise IORPs : the proposal lays down that the competent authority of the home Member State has the sole responsibility for the prudential supervision of all IORPs authorised or registered in its jurisdiction. It establishes the principle that supervision of IORPs needs to be prospective and risk-based, as well as timely and proportionate. In addition, the proposal introduces the supervisory review process which aims to identify IORPs with financial, organisational or other features susceptible to producing a higher risk profile. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications relate to tasks allocated to European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). No new resources will be needed. Operation appropriations which are necessary for the implementation of this initiative will be covered by redeployment within the contribution granted to EIOPA during the annual budgetary procedure, in accordance with the financial programming set by the Communication from the Commission ""Programming of human and financial resources for decentralised agencies 2014-2020"". The estimated impact on expenditure is EUR 2.035 million for the period 2015-2020."
1147EP8,"""""Market stability reserve for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme""""",0.614,0.801,0.94,0.0,0.115,0.836,0.895,0.327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a market stability reserve for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the start of the third trading period (2013-2020), the EU ETS was characterised by a large imbalance between supply and demand of allowances, resulting in a surplus of around 2 billion allowances that is expected to grow over the coming years to more than 2.6 billion allowances by 2020. The reason for this imbalance is primarily a mismatch between the auction supply of emission allowances, which is fixed in a very rigid manner, and demand for them, which is flexible and impacted by economic cycles, fossil fuel prices as well as other drivers. Weakened demand usually goes together with decreasing supply. However, in the EU carbon market this is not the case for auction supply in the current regulatory regime. The EU ETS was set up to deliver EU emissions reduction goals in a harmonised and cost- effective manner. While the environmental objective is guaranteed by the cap, the presence of a large surplus reduces the incentives for low-carbon investment and has a negative effect on the cost-efficiency of the system. In short, if not addressed, these imbalances will profoundly affect the ability of the EU ETS to meet the ETS target in future phases in a cost- effective manner. The Commission report on the state of the European carbon market in 2102 identified the need for measures to tackle structural supply-demand imbalances. This imbalance is expected to continue, and would not be sufficiently addressed by adapting the linear trajectory to a more stringent target within this framework. A change in the linear factor only changes gradually the cap. Accordingly, the surplus would also only gradually decline, such that the market would have to continue to operate for more than a decade with a surplus of around 2 billion allowances or more. In order to address this problem and to make the European Emission Trading System more resilient to imbalances, a market stability reserve should be established. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment shows that :(i) the establishment of a market stability reserve could help address the current imbalances; (ii) such a reserve would make the ETS more resilient to any potential future large-scale event that may severely disturb the supply-demand balance; (iii) operating the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation has the advantage of capturing changes in demand. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a market stability reserve for the EU ETS, as part of the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies. This market stability reserve will operate as of phase 4 starting in 2021 to provide market participants with the necessary certainty as regards the auction supply during phase 3 and an appropriate lead-time for the introduction of the reserve. To ensure predictability, the market stability reserve is designed as an objective and rule- based mechanism on the basis of which the auction volumes are adjusted in an ""automatic manner"" under pre-defined conditions Market stability reserve : the market stability reserve functions by triggering adjustments to annual auction volumes in situations where the total number of allowances in circulation is outside a certain predefined range: · adding allowances to the reserve by deducting them from future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary surplus in the EU ETS if the total surplus is higher than 833 million allowances; · releasing allowances from the reserve and adding them to future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary deficit in the EU ETS provided the total surplus is below 400 million allowances. Allowances are thus placed in and released from the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation. To ensure predictability and more gradual changes to the market stability reserve, a pre- defined volume of 100 million allowances per year would be released from the reserve where the conditions are met. This quantity represents roughly 5% of the current annual emissions in the EU ETS which based on historical experience should be sufficient to cater for even very sudden and strong increases in demand. The proposal also contains provisions aimed at smoothening auctioning supply in the years around transitions between trading phases in cases where the default would otherwise have resulted in sharp changes. If the volume of allowances that should be auctioned in the last year of the period exceeds the average amount to be auctioned in the two following years by more than 30%, this difference will be evenly distributed over these years. This provision builds on the experience gained in the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 of the EU ETS."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: in the context of the current crisis, ensuring a smooth implementation of Cohesion programmes is of particular relevance as they represent the most powerful and relevant lever for assisting the real economy. With total financial resources of EUR 347 billion for the period 2007‑2013, Cohesion policy provides a powerful support for both budgetary stability and public investment in the Member States and the regions of the European Union. Experience shows that more effort is needed to facilitate the management of the Community funding in order to speed up the flow of the funding to the beneficiaries that are most affected by the economic downturn. The December 2008 European Council agreed on a European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), which envisages the initiation of priority action to enable European economies to adjust more rapidly to current challenges. Moreover, the Commission has endeavoured to contribute to the debate currently taking place within the Union and with its international partners on how best to react to the current financial crisis and to its socio-economic consequences. In particular, in the framework of its recovery package, the Commission proposed a number of regulatory changes to simplify the implementation rules for Cohesion Policy and to increase the pre-financing (advance payments) to ERDF and ESF programmes. The additional advance payments have provided an immediate cash injection of EUR 6.25 billion in 2009 to pre-finance investment, within the financial envelope agreed for each Member State for the period 2007‑2013. This amendment brings the total of advance payments in 2009 to EUR 11.25 billion. The Commission proposal was adopted by the Council in May 2009 and all advance payments now have been paid to Member States. Moreover, in June 2009 the Commission presented a Communication on ""A Shared Commitment for Employment"" (COM(2009)0257) in which it proposed additional measures to strengthen the creation of jobs and to counter the effects of the crisis on employment. Therefore, this proposal includes further elements of simplification, with the overall objective of accelerating co-financed investments in Member States and regions and increasing the impact of the funding on the economy as a whole. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal completes a series of regulatory and non‑regulatory adjustments which all seek to stimulate the implementation of cohesion programmes on the ground. The proposal to provide Member States in the case of operational programmes co-financed by the ESF an option to reimburse interim payment claims at 100% for a limited period (up to the end of 2010) will ensure that all certified expenditure of 2009 and 2010 can be paid back without creating a gap in national budgets. Further simplification and clarification of rules governing cohesion policy will undeniably have a positive impact on the pace of programme implementation, particularly by providing national, regional and local authorities clearer and less bureaucratic rules that will allow more flexibility to adapt the programmes to the new challenges. CONTENT: the new measures presented by the Commission aim to simplify certain rules governing cohesion policy. The main changes are as follows: in 2009 and 2010, as part of its 'anti-crisis' measures, the Commission may at the request of the Member States reimburse 100% of the public costs declared by the Member States for projects financed by the ESF. Specifically, Member States will not be obliged to provide national co‑financing, thus speeding up the implementation of projects to support employment. This option does not call into question the distribution of the Funds between the Member States, nor the total budget for the Funds, nor the obligation for Member States to provide subsequent co‑financing; the Commission proposes establishing a single category of 'major project'. Previously, the Commission's approval was required for projects where the total cost exceeded EUR 25 million for the environment and EUR 50 million for other sectors. The threshold for approval is now set at EUR 50 million for all areas. Given the Community importance of the investments in environment as such, the Commission will ask Member States: (i) to ensure an appropriate monitoring of all the investments, including those below the threshold provided in the Regulation; and (ii) to inform the Commission about the implementation progress in the annual reports on operational programmes. Another modification consists of creating the possibility that a single major project is co-financed by more than one programme. This is of particular relevance for projects of nation-wide scope or Community importance, which straddle several regions, and which in the absence of this possibility would have to be artificially separated in multiple projects; the rules relating to 'revenue-generating' projects (for example, toll motorways or projects involving the leasing or sale of land) are also simplified in order to reduce the administrative burdens on the Member States. The proposed modifications intend to simplify the monitoring of revenues and to align this with the overall life-cycle of programmes. Therefore, the duration of the provisions on monitoring revenue is now limited to the date of submission of the closure documents of a programme; Cohesion Policy programmes may be simplified by Member States to take account of the new realities. In addition, certain provisions concerning the obligation to maintain investments over a five-year period will not apply to undertakings which go bankrupt; a proposed modification intends to clarify that in the context of advance payments on State aids admissible guarantees include guarantees by banks or other financial institutions, but also a facility provided for this purpose by public institutions and the Member States themselves; investments in sectors linked to energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies in housing will be encouraged, given their considerable potential to provide growth and jobs; the Commission proposes a modification aimed at increasing flexibility with regard to the rules on decommitment . For example, grants for a major project will in principle be protected as soon as the Member State submits the project to the Commission. Grants are currently only protected once the Commission has approved the project; the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will be able to support the renovation or construction of housing for communities faced with social exclusion, particularly Roma, in both rural and urban areas. Previously, the construction of housing was ineligible under the ERDF and only housing in urban areas was eligible for renovation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of ESF financing provided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period 2007‑2013. Where Member States decide to make use of the option to request 100% reimbursements during 2009 and 2010 there will be an impact on payment appropriations. The analysis of the Member States' payment forecasts and the payment appropriations available in the budget for 2009 and the Draft Budget for 2010 show that the maximum additional payment appropriations to be paid under the 100% reimbursement option in 2009 and 2010 for the ESF programmes would represent approximately EUR 6.6 billion. This will be compensated by a reduced need for payment appropriations later in the programming period. The Commission will set up a monitoring tool to supervise closely the consumption of the additional credits for the European Social Fund. For the payment claims submitted as of 1 January 2011, the regular co‑financing rate agreed in the programme decision will apply. The Commission believes that the proposed measures to simplify the implementation may significantly increase the pace of expenditure on the ground and consequently accelerate the submission of interim payments to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the milk sector went through a deep crisis due to a shift in demand away from dairy products following exceptionally high prices in 2007. The crisis also showed some shortcomings in the market orientation of the milk sector. The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development therefore decided to create a High Level Experts' Group on Milk (HLG) to work on a regulatory framework to be put in place for the medium and long term, which can contribute to stabilising the market and producers' income and enhance transparency. The report and recommendations issued by the HLG were examined by the Council and Presidency conclusions were adopted at the meeting of 27 September 2010. Those conclusions urge the Commission to submit by the end of the year its response to the first three recommendations of the HLG (contractual relations, bargaining power of producers and inter-branch organisations) and to rapidly respond to the HLG recommendation on transparency. One of the key aspects of HLG's work focussed on areas which relate to the structure of the market and the actors in it: contractual relations, bargaining power, producer organisations and inter-branch organisations. According to the HLG, the current market structure significantly worsened aspects of the 2009 milk crisis. The existence for a long period of fixed quotas and high institutional prices, with, in effect, guaranteed outlets for dairy commodities created rigidities in the market. Structural adaptation was often inhibited, actors in the production chain were not stimulated to respond to market signals, including price movements, and there were reduced incentives for innovation or productivity gains. The market structure is very different between and within Member States, but often concentration of supply is much lower than concentration at processing level. This results in an imbalance in bargaining power between these levels. There are also rigidities in the market, with farmers having little choice of dairy (or even of transporters for raw milk). These factors can lead to a serious lack of adaptation of supply to demand and unfair commercial practices. In particular farmers often do not know what price they will receive for their milk when delivering (which is often fixed much later by dairies on a basis wholly out of the farmer's control). The distribution of the added value in the chain is not balanced, especially with regard to farmers, and there is a significant problem of price transmission along the chain. A key problem seems to be between the farmers and the processors and solutions to remedy the situation would focus at this level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: the first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the present proposal addresses all 4 elements: contractual relations, bargaining power of producers, inter-branch organisations and transparency to the extent that they need an amendment to present provisions. The proposal provides for optional written contracts between milk producers and processors to be drawn up in advance of deliveries, which should include details of price, timing and volume of deliveries, and duration. Member States can make the use of contracts compulsory in their territory. Cooperatives, in order to take into account their specific nature, are not required to have contracts if their statutes include elements with similar effects. In order to rebalance bargaining power in the supply chain, the proposal foresees allowing farmers to negotiate contracts collectively through producer organisations. Appropriate quantitative limits to the volume of this negotiation will put farmers on equal footing with the major dairies while maintaining an adequate competition in the raw milk supply. The limits are set at 3.5% of global EU production and 33% of national production, with specific safeguards also provided to avoid serious prejudice in particular to SMEs. The proposal provides also specific EU rules for inter-branch organisations (IPOs) covering all parts of the chain. They can potentially play useful roles in research, improvement of quality, promotion and spreading of best practice in production and processing methods. They would contribute to improving knowledge and the transparency of production and the market. It is proposed to apply the rules on the objectives of IPOs in the fruit and vegetables sector to the dairy sector, with appropriate adaptations, so that hardcore restraints of competition (including price fixing and market partitioning) remain excluded and the agreements concerned are submitted to Commission approval. Again with the purpose of improving knowledge of production and following of developments in the market, it is necessary for the Commission to obtain regular information on volumes of raw milk delivered. In order to further enhance transparency, joint meetings of the experts of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets together with the Advisory Group on Milk will be organised to assess the market situation and prospects, the objective being to increase awareness as well as reinforce the responsibility of operators in the dairy chain to better take into account market signals and adapt supply to demand. Lastly, these measures are proposed to remain valid until 2020, with a review in 2014 and 2018. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed measures which can contribute to stabilize the market and producers' income for the medium and long term have no direct impact on the EU Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: since its adoption, Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 has been amended eight times. All the recent modifications of the Regulation focused on the revision of the positive and the negative visa lists annexed to the Regulation. Over the past few years, the need arose to make some further, technical modifications as well to the main text of the Regulation, e.g. strengthening legal certainty by providing rules for certain situations which were not covered yet by the Regulation and adjusting certain definitions due to recent changes brought by secondary legislation, particularly by the adoption of the Visa Code. Furthermore, ten years after the integration of the Schengen acquis into the framework of the EU and the establishment of the common visa policy, it is necessary to make progress towards further harmonisation of the EU's common visa policy with regard to certain categories listed in the Regulation and left until now to the unilateral decisions of individual Member States. Lastly, as a result of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, further modifications are required, such as the introduction of a safeguard clause and a modification of the reciprocity mechanism. This proposal aims to reconcile these objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the present modification of the Regulation aims at : (1) making provision for a visa safeguard clause allowing the rapid, temporary suspension of the visa waiver for a third country on the positive list in case of an emergency situation, where an urgent response needs to be given to solve the difficulties faced by Member States. Following the adoption of the visa waiver for Albania and Bosnia Herzegovina, certain Member States suggested the insertion of a safeguard clause into Regulation 539/2001, giving power to the Commission to decide on a temporary suspension of the visa waiver, in accordance with a comitology procedure, if certain conditions are met. The clause would be complementary to, but distinct from, the safeguard clause in Article 78(3) of the TFEU. It should be applied only as a temporary measure in clearly defined emergency situations. It should cover only a short period of time and be triggered only in case of an emergency situation, i.e. if there is a sudden change of the situation, e.g. when the relevant figures increase suddenly within a relatively short period of time, and where an urgent ""visa"" response needs to be given to solve the difficulties faced by the Member States affected. Before the safeguard clause is triggered, the Commission will have to assess the situation and there should be no automatism flowing from the notifications by Member States. The Commission will take into account the number of Member States affected by the sudden occurrence of any of the situations listed in this proposal and the overall impact of them on the migratory situation in the EU. In accordance with the comitology rules in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, under the examination procedure, the European Parliament and the Council will receive the proposal for a Commission decision suspending the visa waiver for one or more third countries. The proposal makes provisions ofr information to be available in sufficient time for the European Parliament and the Council to reject or adopt the proposal to amend the lists of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. (2) modifying the reciprocity mechanism : a suggestion has been made by a Member State to modify the current reciprocity mechanism in order to make it more efficient. According to the suggestion, the Commission would be obliged to present a proposal, within a very short period of time, for a temporary restoration of a visa requirement for nationals of a third country, which does not lift the visa obligation within a period of no longer than 12 months of its introduction for a Member State. However, such a modification of the reciprocity mechanism would infringe the exclusive right of initiative of the Commission and would not necessarily lead to adoption of the proposed retaliatory measure. The initial reciprocity mechanism of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 already contained a certain automatism: the notification of non-reciprocity cases was not mandatory; the Member State concerned was free to decide to notify or not. But if notification took place, then Member States were obliged to impose the visa requirement for nationals of the third country concerned provisionally and automatically, 30 days after the notifications, unless the Council decided otherwise. This automatism was considered to be the weakness of the initial reciprocity mechanism and thus it has been abandoned in 2005 as being counter-productive. There is no reason to believe that it would entail more efficiency now. The current reciprocity mechanism, as modified in 2005, is considered to be overall efficient, and the cases of non-reciprocity have been considerably reduced. The remaining non-reciprocity situations are mostly cases where some Member States are considered by third countries not to meet objective criteria for visa waiver set out by these third countries in their domestic legislation. Most Member States also cautioned against an ""automatic"" (re)imposition of a visa requirement for citizens of third countries due to its political implications and advocated instead a tailor-made approach and application of provisional measures in other fields. (3) ensuring compliance with the Visa Code by providing e.g. for appropriate definitions concerning short stay and visa. Accordingly, a visa is an authorisation of transit through or for an intended stay in the territory of the Member States for duration of no more than three months in any six-month period from the date of first entry in the territory of the Member States. The airport transit visa is excluded from this definition, since the visa regime applicable by Member States to third-country nationals transiting through the international airports of Member States is regulated by and contained in the Visa Code. (4) ensuring that the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country national is to be subject to or exempt from the visa requirement . Apart from aligning the definition of “visa” with that in the Visa Code, the proposal seeks to ensure legal clarity by complementing the rules applicable to refugees and stateless persons in order to clarify the applicable visa regime for those residing in the United Kingdom or in Ireland. On the basis of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland and the United Kingdom are not participating in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and its amendments. Thus, for Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 the United Kingdom and Ireland are not considered to be Member States. Consequently, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1932/2006 on the visa rules applicable for refugees and stateless persons do not apply to such persons when they are residing in the United Kingdom or in Ireland. The proposal aims at remedying this unsatisfactory situation by including a provision into the Regulation on refugees and stateless persons residing in the UK or Ireland. (5) making progress towards a full harmonisation of the common visa policy by providing for new, more harmonised rules with regard to the visa requirement or exemption applicable to various categories of third country nationals. The proposal aims at limiting the freedom of Member States to grant visa waiver or to impose a visa requirement to various categories of persons covered by Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 by establishing further common rules on the visa requirement for some of these categories. The following provisions are made: further progress towards full harmonisation with regard to the categories of Article 4(1), for which a de facto harmonisation or quasi harmonisation already exists . Civilian air crew members are exempted from the visa requirement by all Member States. As regards civilian sea crew, all Member States but two exempt such persons from the visa requirement in case of shore leave, while all Member States but two maintain the visa requirement for transit purposes. This amendment will therefore set out the general, harmonised visa exemption for the first category and visa requirement for the second one respectively. There is only one Member State exempting flight crew and attendants on emergency or rescue flights and other helpers in case of a disaster or accident from the visa requirement, therefore this Regulation would abolish this category; procedure to exempt diplomatic and service passport holders of third countries from the visa requirement after the abolition of Council Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 : the current text of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 refers to the procedure established by Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 to be followed when a Member State decides to exempt the diplomatic and/or service passport holders of a third country from the visa requirement. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 789/2001, Member States, willing to exempt holders of diplomatic and service passports of third countries whose nationals are subject to prior consultation, should have submitted a legislative initiative, on which the Council decided by qualified majority (since 2006). As regards the holders of such passports of third countries not subject to prior consultation, Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 obliged Member States simply to communicate to the Council any amendments to their visa rules (requirement or exemption). However, Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 has been repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on visas (Visa Code). It was considered that after the repeal of the above Regulation, the appropriate place to cover these ""procedural"" aspects of national decisions on visa requirement or exemption for such passport holders would be Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, if need be. Thus, in the framework of the present modification, it needs to be examined whether a specific decision-making procedure should be provided for the case when a Member State wants to abolish the visa requirement for the diplomatic and service passport holders of a third country subject to prior consultation. The Commission considers that there is no need to establish such a specific ""common decision mechanism"" for this issue, both for institutional and substantive reasons; (6) clarifying the situation and establishing the legal basis of the visa requirement or exemption for other entities subject to international law which issue diplomatic or service passport or laissez-passers to its members: there are certain entities subject to international law, which do issue diplomatic or service passports or laissez-passers. These entities are not intergovernmental organisations, thus they are not covered at this moment by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. On the other hand they are included in the Table of travel documents and Member States declared whether they recognise their travel documents or not (e.g. Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta). It is necessary to have such entities also covered by Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and Member States should decide and notify to the Commission; (7) adopting new provision in respect of obligations for certain Member States flowing from prior EU/international agreements implying the need to derogate from the common visa rules. Prior to the establishment of the EU common visa policy, the European Union and its Member States have concluded international agreements, like association agreements, with third countries dealing i.a. with the movement of persons and services, which might have an impact on the visa requirement imposed on nationals of third countries. Such international agreements concluded by the Union take primacy over provisions of secondary EU legislation, including Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. In case such international agreements contain a so-called 'standstill clause', it might entail the obligation for certain Member States to derogate from the rules of the common visa policy in accordance with their respective legislations and practices applicable/in force on the date the standstill clause entered into force for them. Therefore, the Commission proposes the introduction in Article 4 of a provision allowing Member States to exempt service providers from the visa requirement, to the extent necessary to respect international obligations concluded by the Community before the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the budget of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Joint Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the European Union (EU) and the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries signed a strategic partnership at the first bi-regional summit of their heads of state and government in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. Since 1999, successive summits have ensured a steady intensification of political dialogue and progress on jointly tackling a wide range of issues including climate change, migration, the fight against illicit drugs, the promotion of human rights and gender equality, education and cultural issues, and in the fields of science and technology. At the Fifth EU-LAC Summit (Lima, 2008), leaders of both regions decided to consider the creation of a bi-regional foundation to foster debate on common strategies and action to strengthen the partnership and enhance its visibility. The EU-LAC Foundation was formally established in Hamburg in 2011 as a German civil law body, pending the possible conclusion of an international constituent agreement to convert it into an international organisation. Council Decision 2012/493/EU authorised the Commission to open negotiations for an international agreement on the creation of the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation, with the EU, its Member States and the LAC countries as members. Negotiations started in December 2012 and the European Parliament has been kept regularly informed throughout the negotiations. The High Representative and the Commission consider that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met, and that the draft Agreement can be submitted for signature and conclusion. CONTENT: the joint proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union. The aim of the Agreement is to establish the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation with legal personality under public international law. The Foundation can be seen as an instrument of EU common foreign policy because its activities contribute to the convergence of Member States' actions towards the Latin American and Caribbean region, ensuring that the EU is able to assert its interests and values in the framework of the partnership between the two regions. Specific activities of the Foundation contribute to the political dialogue between the EU and CELAC in areas such as global governance and the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The Foundation will also strengthen cooperation between the EU and LAC regions, fostering intercultural exchange, notably by facilitating and promoting participation by, and inputs from, civil society and other social actors. It will aim to: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the conclusion of the Agreement will have no direct budgetary implications, as it will be on a voluntary basis. The Commission has made financial contributions to the Foundation since it was established under German civil law in 2011, most recently (through the Partnership Instrument) the sum of EUR 3 million for the two years from October 2015. Some LAC and EU countries, including Germany as host country, have contributed financially on one or more occasions."
2022EP7,"""""Possibility for Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in their territory""""",0.175,0.718,0.912,0.677,0.576,0.892,0.769,0.743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 2001/18/EC as regards the possibility for the Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in their territory. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed establish a comprehensive legal framework for the authorisation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which is fully applicable to GMOs to be used for cultivation purposes throughout the EU as seeds or other plant propagating material. Under this set of legislation, GMOs for cultivation shall undergo an individual risk assessment before being authorised to be placed on the Union market. The aim of this authorisation procedure is to ensure a high level of protection of human life and health, animal health and welfare, the environment and consumer interests, whilst ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market. Once a GMO is authorised for cultivation purposes in accordance with the EU legislative framework on GMOs and complies, as regards the variety that is to be placed on the market, with the requirements of EU legislation on the marketing of seed and plant propagating material, Member States are not authorised to prohibit, restrict, or impede its free circulation within their territory, except under the conditions defined by EU legislation. Experience has shown that cultivation of GMOs is an issue which is more thoroughly addressed by Member States, either at central or at regional and local level. Contrary to issues related to the placing on the market and the import of GMOs, which should remain regulated at EU level to preserve the internal market, cultivation has been acknowledged as an issue with a strong local/regional dimension. In accordance with Article 2(2) TFEU Member States should therefore be entitled to have a possibility to adopt rules concerning the effective cultivation of GMOs in their territory after the GMO has been legally authorised to be placed on the EU market. In this context, it appears appropriate to grant to Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, more freedom to decide whether or not they wish to cultivate GMO crops on their territory without changing the system of Union authorisations of GMOs and independently of the measures that Member States are entitled to take by application of Article 26a of Directive 2001/18/EC to avoid the unintended presence of GMOs in other products. IMPACT ASSESSEMENT: the Commission considers that the amendment of the legislation is necessary to get the right balance between maintaining the EU system of authorisations based on the scientific assessment of health and environmental risks and the need to grant freedom to Member States to address specific national or local aspects raised by the cultivation of GMOs. This approach, while preserving the EU authorisation system of GMOs as well as the free circulation and import of GM food, feed and seeds, is expected to address the demands of several Member States and receive public support. It is also estimated that the potential economic and social benefits of this proposal are likely to outweigh the potential disadvantages. Member States may be in a more appropriate position to carry out their own impact assessments to justify their decisions about cultivation of GMOs in their territories at national/regional/local levels. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 2001/18/EC by introducing a new Article which allows Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of authorised GMOs in part or all of their territories on grounds other than those covered by the environmental risk assessment under the EU authorisation system and those related to avoiding the unintended presence of GMOs in other products. This amendment will apply to GMOs authorised for cultivation either under Directive 2001/18/EC or Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 which also covers applications for cultivation if they concern GMOs that are intended as source materials for the further production of food and feed. It will equally apply to cultivation of all varieties of seed and plant propagating material placed on the market in accordance with relevant EU legislation. The freedom which Member States will obtain will only concern the act of GMO cultivation, but not the placing on the market and import of authorised GM seeds which must continue unimpeded within the framework of the internal market and the respective international obligations of the Union. The proposal sets out two series of conditions under which Member States can take measures: As the assessment of the safety of GMOs for human/animal health and the environment is carried out at EU level, Member States have the possibility under the existing legal framework to invoke the special procedures of the safeguard clause of Directive 2001/18/EC (Article 23) or the emergency measure of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 (Article 34) in case they have serious grounds to consider that the authorised product is likely to constitute a serious risk to health and environment. Consequently, the proposal stipulates that Member States cannot invoke protection of health and environment to justify a national ban of cultivation of GMOs outside these special procedures. Member States can thus invoke grounds (other than those covered by the environmental risk assessment under the EU authorisation system) to restrict or prohibit cultivation of GMOs in their territories. The measures taken by the Member States have to be in conformity with the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular as regards the principle of non-discrimination between national and non-national products and the provisions on quantitative restrictions of trade between Member States (Articles 34 and 36 TFEU). They should finally be consistent with the international obligations of the EU, and in particular with the ones established under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no financial implications for the Union budget. It will have no impact on small or medium-sized undertakings different than the impact of the current situation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: as provided in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (UNCLOS) and in the UN agreement relating to fish stocks of 4 August 1995, the management of certain straddling and highly migratory fish stocks requires the cooperation of all the countries whose fleets exploit that stock in order to ensure their long-term sustainability, either by direct consultation amongst each other or via the appropriate Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs). However, the adoption of unilateral measures by certain States lacking good will to work towards agreed measures may lead to considerable depletion of the fish stock in question even if other States engage in moderating their fishing effort. The EU being a lucrative market of destination for fisheries products, it has a particular responsibility in ensuring that the above-mentioned obligation of cooperation is respected. Therefore, it is necessary to provide the EU with the means to take effective measures against States not cooperating in good faith in the adoption of agreed management measures or responsible for measures and practices that lead to over-exploitation of stocks, in order to create a disincentive for the continuation of this unsustainable fishing. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment analysed the environmental, economic and social impacts of measures ranging from a ""zero option"" to a total ban on importations of the fish and fishery products in question, and including both measures that might extend beyond the trade context and non-legislative approaches. The conclusion of the impact assessment was that it would be pertinent to provide the EU with an instrument allowing the swift adoption of mostly trade-related measures. The measures would be introduced against countries which allow fishing that is conducted in a non-sustainable way that threatens the conservation of fish stocks. Indications of the possible form and content of the instrument were also suggested in the impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFUE). CONTENT: the proposal aims to lay down the framework for the adoption of certain measures regarding fisheries-related activities and policies by third countries with the aim of ensuring long-term sustainability of fish stocks of common interest between the European Union and those third countries. Accordingly, the proposal: · sets out a procedure so that equitable cost-effective measures can be taken in order to promote fisheries sustainability; · describe which countries are to be targeted by the measures (countries allowing non-sustainable fishing), the different types of measures that may be adopted and the conditions determining where and when they may be adopted; · stipulates that the measures are to be adopted as Commission implementing acts (in general the examination procedure would be applicable). Where a requirement for measures to be consistent with the EU international commitments is mentioned, it means that measures must be compatible with the obligations of the EU under the WTO Agreement, in particular as far as trade restrictions are concerned; · defines certain due process steps than shall be undertaken prior to the adoption of the measures vis-à-vis the countries allowing non-sustainable fishing. These demarches should allow the countries concerned to be heard and provide them an opportunity to rectify their actions; · determines the period of application of the measures, subject to the adoption of corrective measures by the countries concerned; defines the Committee that will assist the Commission in implementing the Regulation.

Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU28 WTO schedule for the 143 EU agricultural, fish and industrial WTO tariff-rate quotas (TRQs). The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows into the EU27 and the UK during a representative reference period (of 3 years from 2013 to 2015) for all WTO TRQs. The agreed allocation method is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union (EU) and Kazakhstan are currently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in Brussels on 23 January 1995, which entered into force in June 1999. On 13 April 2011, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the European Commission to negotiate the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan. Negotiation of the Agreement began in June 2011. The Agreement between the parties was signed on 21 December 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date. For the EU, the Agreement constitutes an important step towards increased political and economic involvement in Central Asia. By strengthening political dialogue and improving cooperation in a broad range of areas, it will provide the basis for more effective bilateral engagement with Kazakhstan. Legal nature: the Agreement was negotiated and initialled by the European Union and the Republic of Kazakhstan as the Union's Agreement only. As the European Union's Member States were unanimous in preferring a mixed Agreement, it was agreed to amend the initialled text of the Agreement and the Joint Proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission for a Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Agreement accordingly. In response to this measure, the European Commission made the following statement: ‘Given the political and economic relevance of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) with Kazakhstan, the Commission stresses the importance of signing and ratifying it swiftly. The Commission reiterates its position that a ""mixed"" agreement is legally unnecessary in the present case and that all matters covered by the agreement fall within the EU's competence. The Commission therefore regrets that the Member States insist on signing and ratifying the EPCA with Kazakhstan as a ""mixed"" agreement. The Commission reserves its position as to the future presentation of acts linked to the legal nature of an international agreement.’ Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement, the Agreement was signed by the European Union and the Republic of Kazakhstan as a mixed Agreement. CONTENT: the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission jointly proposed that the Council adopt a Council Decision approving, on behalf of the European Union, the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Kazakhstan, of the other part. The text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision. The Agreement is based on three key points: – Political dialogue and cooperation in the field of foreign and security policy: provisions are provided to set the political dialogue with this country as well as cooperation in the field of foreign and security policy. The Agreement includes the EU’s standard political clauses on human rights, the international criminal courts, weapons of mass destruction, small arms and light weapons and counterterrorism. Provisions are also laid down as regards: - Trade and business: a specific title is provided for: The Agreement contains a substantive trade section with important commitments in several trade policy areas. These will ensure a better regulatory environment for businesses in Kazakhstan, and thus bring substantial economic benefits for EU businesses. - Sectoral cooperation: a series of provisions on cooperation are provided in a wide range of areas: - Institutional framework: the Agreement sets up an institutional framework comprising the Cooperation Council, the Cooperation Committee and the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. It also introduces a procedure for settling disputes, to be used should one of the parties fail to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. Duration of the Agreement: the Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period, and can be terminated at six months’ notice. As of its entry into force, the Agreement supersedes the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Kazakhstan, of the other part, signed on 23 January 1995."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. If no agreement on the future relationship that covers aviation safety is reached by the end of the transition period, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union will affect in particular the validity of certificates and licenses issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency on behalf of the United Kingdom, or by certain design organisations based in the United Kingdom. Regarding certain aeronautical products (‘type certificates’) and companies (‘organisation approvals’), the United Kingdom resumes, for its jurisdiction as of the end of the transition period, the role of ‘State of design’ under the Convention on International Civil Aviation. It is therefore necessary to develop a controlled transition mechanism, ensuring that the affected products or designs, which were certified by the Agency or a design organisation certified by the Agency before the end of the transition period, can continue to be used in Union aircraft without disruption. CONTENT: the proposal concerns aviation safety and complements Union Regulation (EC) 2018/1139 to deal specifically with the situation entailed by the end of transition period set in the withdrawal agreement in the absence of an agreement covering aviation safety matters applicable by that date. The proposal should allow EU manufacturers to continue production and operators to continue to operate these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. An interruption of these activities would cause serious economic and social difficulties. By ensuring compliance with EU law by the bodies concerned, the proposal should also ensure the protection of consumers and citizens. This Regulation should apply to the certificates listed in the Annex which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by the Agency to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom or by a design organisation having its principal place of business in the United Kingdom. It shall only apply in respect of aircraft registered in the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. It is applied by all Member States with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries. The first series of visa waiver agreements were signed on 6 May 2015 (United Arab Emirates), 26 May 2015 (Timor-Leste) and 28 May 2015 (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu) and provisionally apply from the date of signature pending their entry into force. The Council has authorised the signature of a second series of visa waiver agreements with Tonga (signed on 20 November 2015), Colombia (signed on 2 December 2015), Kiribati (date of signature to be determined) and Palau (signed on 7 December 2015). These four agreements provisionally apply from the day following the date of signature pending their entry into force. The negotiations with Tuvalu were opened on 19 November 2014. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators in Brussels on 8 October 2015. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Tuvalu on the short-stay visa waiver. The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Tuvalu when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Tuvalu to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Tuvalu may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For those travelling to carry out a paid activity, each Member State and also Tuvalu remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. A joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Tuvalu to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. A joint declaration on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis is annexed to the agreement. Lastly, the Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement."

BACKGROUND: pursuant to Council Decision 2012/130/EU the Union is a Contracting Party to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean (the SPRFMO Convention), which established the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO), since 26 July 2010. Within the SPRFMO, the Commission of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation is responsible for the adoption of measures designed to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources through the application of the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, and, in so doing, to safeguard the marine ecosystems in which these resources occur. Such measures may become binding upon the Union. The conservation and management measures adopted by SPRFMO must be fully transposed into Union law and uniformly and effectively implemented within the Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims at transposing already existing SPRFMO conservation and management measures, binding upon the Contracting Parties. The Regulation shall apply to: the Union fishing vessels fishing in the SPRFMO Convention area or, in the case of transhipments, in the area outside the SPRFMO Convention area for the species caught in the SPRFMO Convention area; third country fishing vessels that access EU ports and that carry fishery products harvested in the Convention Area. The proposal refers to: management, conservation and control measures concerning certain species (SPRFMO management measures applicable to jack mackerel and seabird mitigation measures) ; management, conservation and control measures concerning certain fishing methods (bottom fishing and exploratory fisheries); common control measures : (i) authorisations for fishing vessels and the SPRFMO Record of Vessels; (ii) provisions on transhipment activities; (iii) data collection and reporting; (iv) surveillance and observer programmes; (v) inspection in EU ports of third country fishing vessels carrying fishery products harvested in SPRFMO; (vi) applicable procedure in case of apparent infringements during port inspections; (vii) rules on enforcement and compliance, notably the circulation of information on illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing activities, the implementation of measures vis-à-vis fishing vessels included in the SPRFMO IUU list and the management of compliance issues.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Consequently, unless another date is established in a withdrawal agreement, or the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously establishes another date, Union law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019. The United Kingdom will then become a third country. CONTENT: this proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council adapting Directive 2012/27/EU [as amended by Directive 2018/XXX/EU] on energy efficiency and the Regulation (EU) 2018/XXX [Governance of the Energy Union] is necessitated by the upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In this regard, it is necessary to technically adapt the projected energy consumption figures for the European Union in 2030 to reflect the Union of 27 Member States. Projections made for the at least 32.5 % Union headline target show that primary energy consumption should equal 1 273 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) and 956 Mtoe of final energy consumption in 2030 for the Union of 28 Member States. The equivalent projections for the EU 27 excluding the United Kingdom show that primary energy consumption should equal 1 128 Mtoe and final energy consumption should equal 846 Mtoe in 2030. This requires the adaptation of the figures for energy consumption levels in 2030. Lastly, Member States shall take into account the projections for the EU27 when notifying the Commission of national indicative energy efficiency contributions towards the EU target for 2030 as part of their integrated national energy and climate plans."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the European Council of 27 and 28 June 2013, it was considered that a budgetary solution should be found to address certain issues stemming from the final outcome of the negotiations of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 for those Member States most affected, namely France, Italy and Spain. In view of the current economic crisis, as a contribution to the special effort needed to address the specific situations of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and of poverty and social exclusion in these Member States, the European Social Fund allocations to those three Member States for the year 2013 should be increased. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The Commission is proposing to amend Council Regulation (EC) 1083/2006 with a view to providing France, Italy and Spain with EUR 100 million, EUR 30 million and EUR 20 million respectively as additional commitments to their 2013 ESF allocations. Nonetheless, since the amounts in the regulation are expressed in 2004 prices, the corresponding amounts quoted in the regulation total EUR 126 million broken down as follows: EUR 84 million for France, EUR 17 million for Spain, and EUR 25 million for Italy. The compensation will be provided from the 2007-2013 period with the amounts been made available through the flexibility instrument. From a legal perspective, it is proposed to: modify the Regulation’s articles dealing with: (i) global resources; (ii) on the resources available for the Convergence objective; (iii) the resources available for the Regional competitiveness and employment objective and (iv) budget commitments; modify Annex I on the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations and Annex II on the criteria and methodology for the allocation of the resources.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: crowdfunding is a financing model normally involves the project owners that propose the project to be funded, investors that support the proposed project through funding and a moderating platform that brings the parties together to finance and launch the project in question. Crowdfunding platforms are increasingly used as a tool to finance various activities for small and nascent firms. Some Member States have already introduced domestic bespoke regimes on crowdfunding. However, Member States tailor their regulatory frameworks to the characteristics and needs of local markets and investors, which results in differences of how the rules are designed and implemented with respect to the conditions of operation of crowdfunding platforms, scope of permitted activities and licencing requirements. Due to the lack of an appropriate EU framework for crowdfunding activity, crowdfunding services providers are facing difficulties in scaling their operations and cross-border flows remain limited. The proposal for a regulation on European crowdfunding service providers aims to facilitate their provision on a cross-border basis, while managing operational risks and ensuring a high degree of transparency and investor protection. In the interest of legal certainty and in order to avoid the application of requirements stemming from Directive 2014/65/EU to the provision of crowdfunding services, it is necessary to explicitly specify that Directive 2014/65/EU does not apply to persons authorised as crowdfunding service providers as defined in the proposed regulation on European crowdfunding service providers. This initiative is related to part of the Commission's priority of establishing a Capital Market Union (CMU), which aims to broaden access to finance for innovative companies, start-ups and other unlisted firms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main economic and social impacts have been thoroughly examined in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European crowdfunding service providers. CONTENT: this proposal amends the scope of Directive 2014/65/EU in order to exempt crowdfunding service providers from the obligations arising from Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Price segmentation between developed country markets and the poorest developing country markets is necessary to ensure that the poorest developing countries are supplied with essential pharmaceutical products at heavily reduced prices. Therefore, those heavily reduced prices cannot be understood as a reference for the price to be paid for the same products in developed country markets. The proposed codified Regulation serves the purpose of preventing tiered priced products from being imported into the Union. Exemptions are laid down for certain situations under the strict provision that it is ensured that the final destination of the products in question is one of the countries listed in Annex II. More specifically, the proposed Regulation lays down: the criteria for establishing what is a tiered priced product; the conditions under which the customs authorities shall take action; the measures which shall be taken by the competent authorities in the Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. More specifically: (i) agricultural prices have fallen sharply as a result of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions; (ii) the EU has become more open to global markets; (iii) the EU has made new commitments at international level, for example on climate change mitigation (through COP 21). On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a regulation defining the objectives of the CAP as well as rules on support for strategic plans to be developed by Member States in the framework of the CAP; a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. CONTENT: this proposal for a horizontal regulation of the CAP seeks to maintain the current structure of the CAP in two pillars with annual measures of general application in Pillar I (direct payments) complemented by measures reflecting the national and regional specificities under a multi-annual programming approach in Pillar II (rural development). The financing of the various CAP interventions and measures from the Union budget is provided by (i) the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and (ii) the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Increased subsidiarity for Member States : the new design of the CAP for post 2020 will point to an increased subsidiarity so that Member States can better tailor implementing measures under both Pillars to their realities and farmers' concrete circumstances. On this basis, the current CAP Horizontal Regulation is adapted to the new delivery model and reflects more flexibility for Member States in implementing the policy (in line with their local needs), less bureaucracy for beneficiaries and shift to a performance-based policy. Setting targets at EU level : the move at EU level from an emphasis on compliance to performance requires a clear identification of the objectives which the policy has to achieve: again, these objectives shall be established at EU level. In order to advance towards a more result-driven policy mechanism, there shall be a shift from assurance on legality and regularity of the underlying transactions to assurance on performance and the respect of EU basic requirements, like (IACS) or the governance bodies (paying agencies, coordinating bodies, competent authorities and certification bodies). The robust and reliable governance structures which characterise the CAP will be maintained. Controls and sanctions : in addition to financing provisions, the CAP Horizontal Regulation continues to have provisions on general principles for checks and penalties, checks for conditionality and the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS). A new system of ‘conditionality’ shall link all farmers' income support (and other area- and animal-based payments) to the application of environment- and climate-friendly farming practices. Accordingly, the proposed Regulation lays down rules on financing, management and control systems, clearance processes (annual financial clearance and annual performance clearance) and conformity procedure. Simplification : in line with the new delivery model, an annual performance clearance shall be established in order to check the eligibility of the expenditure in relation to the reported outputs. The proposal also provides for a reduction in the number of paying agencies and strengthens the role of the coordinating body and the certification body. It introduces the concept of the single audit approach and provides that the number of audits carried out by the Commission can be reduced. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy. Agricultural reserve : a new agricultural reserve shall be established in the EAGF, to provide additional support for the agricultural sector for the purpose of safety-net measures in the context of market management or stabilisation and/or in case of crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution. The amount of the reserve shall be at least EUR 400 million at the beginning of each financial year. Non-committed appropriations of the agricultural reserve shall be carried over without time limitation to finance the agricultural reserve in the following financial years. Transfer of allocations : Member States shall have the possibility to transfer up to 15% of their CAP allocations between direct payments and rural development and vice versa, to ensure the financing of their priorities and measures."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and India was signed in New Delhi on 23 November 2001 and entered into force on 14 October 2002. The Agreement has been renewed for additional periods of five years, in 2009 and 2015 respectively. The current Agreement is due to expire on 17 May 2020. The Commission believes that the Agreement provides an important framework for conducting and facilitating cooperation between the EU and India in common priority science and technology areas of mutual benefit. In the past years, under the Horizon 2020 Programme, - a joint call on water resulted in 7 selected projects for a total of EUR 30 million with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT); - a joint call on new generation vaccines with DBT for a total of EUR 30 million resulted in 3 selected projects; - two innovation initiatives were launched: an incubators network and an innovation platform, resulting on more than 20 innovation partnerships among its participants; - an Implementing Arrangement between the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) and the European Commission was signed to facilitate mobility of Indian researchers to European Research Council grantees teams; - two cofunding mechanisms were set up by DBT and the Ministry of Earth Science (MoES) to fund successful Indian participants in more than 50 Horizon 2020 calls. At the meeting of the India-EU Joint Steering Committee established by the Agreement, held in New Delhi on 1 March 2019, both Parties noted their intention to renew the Agreement for a further period of five years without any amendment. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the renewal of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of India for an additional period of five years (i.e. from 17.5.2020 to 16.5.2025). The Agreement allows for a frame to identify areas of cooperation on research and innovation of mutual interest and in line with the EU's agenda and strategy on international cooperation. This Decision shall make it possible to: - improve and intensify their cooperation in scientific and technological areas of common interest in line with the EU Strategy on India; - foster additional exchange of specific knowledge and transfer of know-how to the benefit of the scientific communities, industry and citizens; - provide a useful forum to assess past cooperation and determine future actions, including on topics making the cooperation effective such as open access and open innovation principle; - to derive mutual benefit from the scientific and technological progress achieved through cooperative activities while enabling the Union and India to address global challenges together and the Union to contribute to India's sustainable modernisation. The Commission shall regularly monitor all actions under the Agreement, including cooperative activities. The budgetary impact (appropriations of an administrative nature) is estimated at EUR 0.360 million for the period 2020-2025."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with council. BACKGROUND: the misuse of hosting service providers by terrorist groups and their supporters to disseminate terrorist-related content in order to spread their message, radicalise and attract new recruits, as well as to facilitate and direct terrorist activities is of particular concern. Efforts at Union level to counter terrorist content online commenced in 2015 through a framework of voluntary cooperation between Member States and hosting service providers, the EU Internet Forum. The Commission proposes to complement these efforts with a clear legislative framework in order to further reduce accessibility to terrorist content online and adequately address a rapidly evolving problem. This legislative framework seeks to build on voluntary efforts, which were reinforced by the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2018/334 and responds to calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 15 June 2017 to strengthen measures to tackle illegal and harmful content and by the European Council to improve the automatic detection and removal of content that incites to terrorist acts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that a series of measures were needed to achieve the strategic objective of reducing online terrorist content. Three main options were considered, in addition to the baseline scenario, with increasing degrees of effectiveness in achieving the objectives set in the impact assessment. CONTENT: the draft regulation aims to increase the effectiveness of current measures to detect, identify and remove terrorist content online without encroaching on fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression and information. In specific terms, the proposal: defines terrorist content as material and information that incites, encourages or advocates the commission or contribution to terrorist offences, provides instructions for the commission of such offences or promotes the participation in activities of a terrorist group; provides for duties of care to be applied by hosting service providers when taking action in accordance with the regulation and in particular, with due regard to the fundamental rights involved; requires Member States to empower competent authorities to issue removal orders and lays down a requirement for hosting service providers to remove content within one hour of the receipt of a removal order; sets out the minimum elements referrals should contain and procedures for hosting service providers to give feedback to the issuing authority, and to inform the latter if it is not possible to comply with the order or if further clarification is required; requires hosting service providers, where appropriate, to take proactive measures commensurate with the level of risk and to remove terrorist material from their services, including deploying automated detection tools; requires hosting service providers to: (i) preserve removed content and related data for six months for review proceedings and for investigative purposes; (ii) explain their policies against terrorist content and to publish annual transparency reports on the actions taken in this regard; (iii) put in place specific safeguards and remedies to ensure that users can challenge the deletion of their content; requires Member States to ensure that competent authorities have sufficient capability and resources to combat online terrorist content and to cooperate with each other and, where appropriate, with Europol, to avoid duplicating work and any interference with ongoing investigations; provides for the establishment of points of contact by both hosting service providers and Member States to facilitate communication between them, particularly in relation to referrals and removal orders; requires hosting service providers which do not have an establishment within any Member State but which do offer services within the Union, to designate a legal representative in the Union; specifies that Member States should lay down rules on penalties for non-compliance and provides criteria for Member States to take into account when determining the type and level of penalties."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). On 22 December 2009, the Council agreed on the principle of launching bilateral negotiations with individual ASEAN countries based on the authorisation and negotiating directives of 2007, whilst preserving the strategic objective of a region-to-region agreement. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in October 2013 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Vietnam an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. Vietnam has become the EU's second biggest trading partner in ASEAN after Singapore and ahead of Malaysia, with trade between the EU and Vietnam worth EUR 47.6 billion in 2017. It is one of the fastest growing countries in ASEAN. According to a study on the economic benefits to be expected from the FTA, EU exports to Vietnam are expected to increase by more than EUR 8 billion by 2035, while exports from Vietnam to the EU are expected to increase by EUR 15 billion. These estimates correspond to an increase, in relative terms, in EU exports to Vietnam of almost 29% and in exports from Vietnam to the EU of almost 18%. The EU's national income could increase by more than EUR 1.9 billion by 2035 as a result of the FTA, while Vietnam's could increase by EUR 6 billion over the same period. CONTENT: the draft Council decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Vietnam. The Agreement was signed subject to its conclusion at a later date. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured: the comprehensive liberalisation of services and investment markets, including crosscutting rules on licensing and for the mutual recognition of diplomas, and sectorspecific rules designed to ensure a level playing field for EU businesses; new tendering opportunities for EU bidders in Vietnam, who is not a member of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement; the removal of technical and regulatory trade barriers to trade in goods, such as duplicative testing, in particular by promoting the use of technical and regulatory standards familiar in the EU in the sectors of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, as well as green technologies; based on international standards, a more trade-facilitative regime for the approval of European food exports to Vietnam; Vietnam’s commitment to reduce or eliminate its tariffs on imports from the EU, and a cheaper access of European businesses and consumers to products originating in Vietnam; a high level protection of intellectual property rights, including with regard to the enforcement of these rights, also at the border, and a TRIPs-plus level of protection of EU GIs; a comprehensive chapter on trade and sustainable development, which aims at ensuring that trade supports labour rights, environmental protection and social development and promotes the sustainable management of forests and fisheries; and a swift dispute resolution mechanisms through either panel arbitration or with the help of a mediator. The EU-Vietnam FTA and IPA include institutional provisions that lay down an implementing bodies’ structure to continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of the agreements. It establishes a Trade Committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement."

BACKGROUND: the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No 29) of the ILO is one of the ILO’s eight fundamental Conventions that make up the core international labour standards, and it is considered a human rights instrument.. Yet, more than 80 years later, despite almost universal ratification of the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different forms to those that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century. The ILO estimates that at least 20.9 million people globally are victims of forced labour. In 2014, the International Labour Conference adopted the Protocol on the forced labour convention seeks to address gaps in implementation and to make progress on preventing trafficking for labour exploitation and protecting and compensating victims of forced labour. The European Union (EU) is committed to promoting human rights and decent work and to eradicating trafficking in human beings, both internally and in its external relations. In ratifying ILO Conventions and related Protocols, EU Member States send an important signal on the coherence of the EU’s policy in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work and improving working conditions worldwide.

The Protocol is a binding international agreement, subject to ratification, and is linked to the Convention. It creates legal obligations applicable to ratifying States and can only be ratified by States that have ratified the Convention. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), and more specifically on concluding and ratifying an ILO Convention, Member States are not able to decide to ratify the Protocol outside the framework of the EU’s institutions, as parts of the Protocol fall into areas of EU competence. However, the EU as such cannot ratify an ILO Protocol, because under the ILO rules only States can be parties to such Protocols. The Protocol’s provisions strengthen the international legal framework by establishing obligations to prevent forced labour and to provide victims with protection and access to remedies, such as compensation. The Protocol sets out the measures that ILO Member States must take to prevent forced labour, namely: The Protocol addresses areas of EU law that are already subject to an advanced degree of regulation: (i) certain aspects relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in respect of which EU law sets minimum standards on anti-trafficking and victims’ rights; (ii) certain aspects relating to rules on asylum and immigration. The Commission proposes that the Decision should be based on the one hand on Article 218(6) TFEU, in conjunction with Article 82(2) TFEU, which provides the main legal basis for EU legislation on judicial cooperation in criminal matters relevant to addressing trafficking in human beings and victims’ rights. The provisions of the draft Protocol other than the provisions related to judicial cooperation in criminal matters will be subject to a Decision adopted in parallel to this Decision. The Decision recommends that Member States should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Protocol with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably by 31 December 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: public sector information is an important primary material for digital content products and services with a large hitherto unexploited potential. The economic importance of opening data resources, including public data, is now widely recognised. A recent study estimates the total market for public sector information in 2008 at € 28 billion across the Union. The same study indicates that the overall economic gains from further opening up public sector information by allowing easy access are around €40 billion a year for the EU27. The total direct and indirect economic gains from PSI applications and use across the whole EU27 economy would be in the order of €140 billion annually Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on the re-use of public sector information aims to facilitate the re-use of PSI throughout the Union by harmonising the basic conditions for reuse and removing major barriers to re-use in the internal market. The review was carried out by the Commission and resulted in the publication of Communication COM(2009) 212. It found that, despite the progress made, a number of barriers still persisted namely: · attempts by public sector bodies to maximise cost recovery, as opposed to benefits for the wider economy, competition between the public and the private sector; · practical issues hindering re-use, such as the lack of information on available PSI, and the mindset of public sector bodies failing to realise the economic potential. The Commission concluded that a further review should be carried out by 2012, when more evidence on the impact, effects and application of the Directive would be available. This proposal of the Commission is the result of the second review. The review of the Directive thus forms part of the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Europe 2020 strategy aiming for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined 5 options to deal with the identified problems, i.e. insufficient clarity and transparency of PSI re-use rules, locked information resources, excessive charges, lack of a level playing field, insufficient enforcement of re-use provisions, and inconsistent approaches adopted by individual Member States. Option 1: No policy change : no changes to the Directive (baseline); Option 2: Discontinuing existing Union action : repeal of the PSI Directive; Option 3: Soft law measures (e.g. Commission guidelines or recommendations); Option 4: Legislative amendments (amending the substance of the Directive, i.e. the rights and obligations established by its provisions); Option 5: Packaged solution combining substantive changes to the re-use framework (Option 4) with additional guidance on the principles to be applied by national authorities when they implement it at national level (Option 3). The Commission considers that combining legislative amendments with soft law measures (option 5) combines the benefits of option 3 and 4. This will hence ensure the convergence of national re-use friendly regulatory approaches throughout the internal market, thereby enhancing legal certainty, increasing incentives and lowering barriers to PSI re-use. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the overall aim of this revision is to eliminate persisting and emerging differences between Member States in the exploitation of public sector information, which hamper realisation of the full economic potential of this resource. Specific aims are to facilitate the creation of Union-wide products and services based on PSI, to ensure the effective cross-border use of PSI for value-added products and services, to limit distortions of competition on the Union market, and to prevent the deepening of disparities among Member States in dealing with reuse of PSI. The content of the proposal corresponds to those aims. This includes: extension of the scope of the Directive to currently excluded sectors (cultural, educational and research establishments as well as public service broadcasters); establishing a rule for charging based on marginal costs, possibly with exceptions; amending the general principle to make accessible documents re-usable; imposing a requirement to publish data in machine-readable formats; imposing a requirement to appoint an independent regulator and to provide for an effective and efficient redress mechanism; reversing the burden of proof of compliance with charging requirements; imposing a requirement to define the scope of ‘public task’ by legislative means only. The Commission should assist the Member States in implementing the Directive in a consistent way by giving guidance, particularly on charging and calculation of costs, on recommended licensing conditions and on formats, after consulting interested parties.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: ·  Article 290 of the TFUE allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts); ·  Article 291 of the TFUE allows Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts (implementing acts). Following a reference for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC for the Bayerischer Verwaltungsgerichtshof (case C-442/09), the Court of Justice issued a ruling, whereby it qualifies pollen in honey as an ingredient within the meaning of Article 6(4)(a) of Directive 2000/13/EC on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs. In light of these considerations, a draft proposal amending Directive 2001/110/EC has been prepared. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no significant changes for interested parties are expected and for this reason, no impact assessment has been carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 TFEU. CONTENT : the proposal aims to: ·  identify the delegated and implementing powers that should be conferred upon the Commission as regards Directive 2001/110/EC and establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of this act in the new legal context determined by the entry into force of Articles 290 and 291 TFUE; ·  clarify, in view of the judgement of the Court of Justice in Case C-442/09, that pollen in honey is not an ingredient in the sense of Article 6(4)(a) of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, but is a constituent of honey, which is a natural substance that has no ingredients. This clarification will not prevent the applicability of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 to honey containing GM pollen, and in particular will not affect the conclusion of the Court of Justice that honey containing GM pollen can be placed on the market only if it is covered by an authorisation in accordance with that Regulation.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. BACKGROUND: adopted in early 2003, the Market Abuse Directive (MAD) 2003/6/EC introduced a comprehensive framework to tackle insider dealing and market manipulation practices, jointly referred to as ""market abuse"". However, experience has shown that the objective of the Directive, to increase investor confidence and market integrity, has not been achieved. The report by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU recommended that a sound prudential and conduct of business framework for the financial sector must rest on strong supervisory and sanctioning regimes. To this end, the Group considers that supervisory authorities must be equipped with sufficient powers to act and should be able to rely on equal, strong and deterrent sanctions regimes against all financial crimes, sanctions which should be enforced effectively. However, the High-Level Group considers that none of these is currently in place"" and Member States sanctioning regimes are regarded as in general weak and heterogeneous. The Commission has published a Communication with regard to sanction regimes in the financial sector. It concluded that the Commission will assess whether the introduction of criminal sanctions, and the establishment of minimum rules on the definition of criminal offences and sanctions may prove to be essential in order to ensure the effective implementation of EU financial services legislation Following the approach set out in the Communication of 20 September 2011 ""Towards an EU criminal policythe Commission considers that minimum rules on criminal offences and on criminal sanctions for market abuse, which would be transposed into national criminal law and applied by the criminal justice systems of the Member States, can contribute to ensuring the effectiveness of this Union policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options related to criminal sanctions were considered as part of this preparatory work. One of the problems identified in the impact assessment is the fact that the sanctions currently in place to fight market abuse offences are lacking impact and are insufficiently dissuasive, which results in ineffective enforcement of the Directive. In addition, the definition of which insider dealing or market manipulation offences constitute criminal offences diverges considerably from Member State to Member State. For example, five Member States do not provide for criminal sanctions for disclosure of inside information by primary insiders and eight Member States do not do so for secondary insiders. Since market abuse can be carried out across borders, this divergence undermines the internal market and leaves a certain scope for perpetrators of market abuse to carry such abuse in jurisdictions which do not provide for criminal sanctions for a particular offence. The impact assessment concluded that requiring Member States to introduce criminal sanctions for the most serious market abuse offences was essential to ensure the effective implementation of the Union policy on market abuse. LEGAL BASIS: Article 83 (2) of the TFEU. CONTENT: proposals to strengthen and ensure the coherence of administrative sanctions are included in the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on insider dealing and market manipulationthat also intends to remedy other major problems in the existing system. This proposal lays down a requirement for Member States to provide for minimum rules on the definition of the most serious market abuse offences and on minimum levels of criminal sanctions attached to them. The main points are as follows: Criminal offences: two forms of market abuse conduct, namely insider dealing and market manipulation, should be regarded as criminal offences if committed intentionally. The attempt to commit insider dealing and market manipulation should also be punishable as a criminal offence. The offence relating to inside information should apply to persons who possess inside information of which they know that it is inside information. The offence relating to market manipulation is applicable to anybody. Inciting, aiding and abetting and attempt: the proposal provides that inciting as well as aiding and abetting the defined criminal offences are also punishable in Member States. The attempt to commit one of the offences defined in the Directive is also covered, with the exception of improper disclosure of inside information and dissemination of information which gives false or misleading signals, as it does not seem appropriate to define attempts to commit these offences as criminal offences. Criminal sanctions: the proposal requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the criminal offences identified in the text are subject to criminal sanctions. These sanctions should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Liability of legal persons: the proposal requires Member States to ensure that legal persons can be held liable for the criminal offences defined in the directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the 1979 World Trade Organisation (WTO) plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft was adopted as part of the Tokyo Round. It entered into force on 1 January 1980 and it now has 32 signatories. This Agreement eliminates import duties on all aircraft, other than military aircraft, as well as on all other products covered by the agreement, in particular civil aircraft engines and their parts and components, all components and sub-assemblies of civil aircraft, and flight simulators and their parts and components. It contains disciplines on government-directed procurement of civil aircraft and prohibition of inducements to purchase, as well as on government financial support for the civil aircraft sector. The Annex to the Agreement lists the products that shall be accorded duty-free or duty-exempt treatment, if such products are for the use in civil aircraft or ground flying trainers and for incorporation therein, in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance rebuilding, modification or conversion. Products in the Annex of the Agreement are classified according to their respective tariff headings for customs purposes under the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System) developed by the World Customs Organization. Since the adoption of the ATCA, different versions of Harmonized System have been adopted. In November 2001, members adopted a Protocol Amending the Annex to the ATCA, transposing into the Annex the changes introduced in the 1992, 1996 and 2002 versions of the Harmonised System. Another revision of the Harmonized System took place in 2007. On 5 November 2015, after several years of discussions, the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft agreed to open for acceptance the revised Product Coverage of the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft via the Protocol amending the annex to the ATCA. CONTENT: the Commission is presenting the Commission is submitting a proposal to the Council for a decision on the conclusion of the Protocol amending the Product Coverage Annex of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. The protocol covers matters that fall under the common commercial policy and the amendment concerns a technical update of an international agreement without altering its scope or content. The new Protocol open for acceptance on 5th November 2015 by the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft will modify the 2001 Protocol to make it compatible with the 2007 version of the Harmonized System."
6171EP7,"""""Fluorinated greenhouse gases""""",0.789,0.857,0.965,0.484,0.545,0.916,0.887,0.8,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure a high level of environmental protection by reducing substantially fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (""UNFCCC""), to which the Union is party, on the basis of existing scientific data, developed countries would need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % to 95 % below 1990 emissions by 2050 to limit global climate change to a temperature increase of 2°C and thus prevent undesirable climate effects. The Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 proposes a cost-effective way of achieving the necessary overall emission reductions in the Union by 2050. This roadmap establishes the sectoral contributions needed in six areas. Non-CO2 emissions (including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO2 emissions from agriculture) should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. In September 2011 the Commission published a report on the application of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases. It concluded that the Regulation could deliver significant emission reductions if it was further improved and fully applied. It also stated that more needed to be done to further reduce F-gas emissions in the EU. By ensuring that F-gases are replaced by safe alternatives with no or a lower impact on the climate, yearly emissions expressed in CO2 equivalent could be cut by two-thirds by 2030 at relatively low cost. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission, finally, only retained those options that were shown to deliver substantial emission savings at low abatement costs and to be consistent with other EU policies. The methodological basis for the impact assessment was a detailed analysis of the feasibility of introducing safe, energy-efficient alternatives in the 28 main sectors that use F-gases. The impact assessment showed that: a phase-down of HFCs that introduces gradually lower limits until 2030 for the amounts of these F-gases to be put on the market in the EU would deliver the most emission savings, reducing today’s emissions by two-thirds by 2030 (roughly 70 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent); an emission reduction of two thirds would prepare EU industry for a phase-down. It would lead to cost reductions due to higher market penetration and to economies of scale for alternative technologies, thus helping to reach an agreement on the proposals under the Montreal Protocol. Administrative costs can be kept relatively low (total administrative costs of around EUR 2 million a year for a phase-down). LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to: replace Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases in order to ensure a more cost-efficient contribution to achieving the EU’s climate objectives by discouraging the use of F-gases with a high impact on the climate in favour of energy-efficient and safe alternatives, and further improving the containment and end-of-life treatment of products and equipment that contain F-gases; enhance sustainable growth, stimulate innovation and develop green technologies by improving market opportunities for alternative technologies and gases with a low impact on the climate; bring the EU into line with the latest scientific findings at international level, as described in the Fourth Assessment Report of the UN’s IPCC, e.g. with regard to the substances covered by this regulation and the calculation of their global warming potential (GWP); help to bring about a consensus on an international agreement to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the most relevant group of F-gases, under the Montreal Protocol; simplify and clarify Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 to reduce administrative burden in line with the Commission’s commitment to better regulation. The key aspects of the proposal are as follows: Adaptation of existing provisions: the proposal maintains the current provisions of the F-Gas Regulation, with adjustments to ensure better implementation and enforcement of the legislation by national authorities. Some containment measures have also been extended to refrigerated trucks and trailers. Mechanism for the gradual reductions of HFCs: the most important new measure is the introduction of quantitative limits on the supply of bulk HFC substances in the EU, decreasing over time. The phase-down mechanism involves a gradually declining cap on the total placement of bulk HFCs (in tonnes of CO2 equivalent) on the market in the EU with a freeze in 2015, followed by a first reduction in 2016 and reaching 21 % of the levels sold in 2008–11 by 2030. By means of this mechanism: companies that place bulk HFCs on the EU market must have rights to place bulk substances on the EU market for the first time; the Commission allocates free quotas to companies based on past reporting data, with a reserve for new entrants; companies must make sure that they have enough rights to cover their actual placing of products and equipment on the market. the Commission checks compliance the following year, with independent verification of reports; a threshold ensures that companies that only place small quantities on the market are exempted. HFCs imported in pre-charged equipment: these should also be counted under the phase-down. Therefore, non-hermetically sealed HFC appliances would still be able to be produced in, or imported into, the EU but they would have to be filled at the place of installation. Similarly, the placing on the market of movable air conditioning containing HFCs will be banned from 2020. Additional bans: a few additional bans are introduced to underpin the phase-down mechanism and restrict the use of other F-gases not covered by the mechanism. Recharging of existing refrigeration equipment with a charge size over 5 tonnes of CO2 equivalent with HFC of very high GWP (>2500) will not be permitted from 2020 onwards as more adequate and energy efficient drop-in refrigerants of lower GWP are already widely available on the market. Restrictions on the use of SF6 in magnesium die casting is extended also to facilities using less than 850 kg per year as technological progress has rendered such use obsolete. Lastly, additional reporting obligations should enable monitoring of the use of F-gases that are not covered by current legislation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
1416EP7,"""""Rights of passengers in bus and coach transport""""",0.807,0.861,0.105,0.516,0.515,0.169,0.841,0.171,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to ensure adequate levels of protection to passengers in bus and coach transport in particular to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he market for international carriage of passengers by bus and coach has already been liberalised. This mode of transport is characterised by a number of distinctive features which affect both the operators and passengers. In passenger-kilometre terms, bus and coach transport holds a 9.3 % share of all land transport services within the European Union and, after passenger cars (82.8%), it remains the most important means of transportation available to the public (8.3 % share in all modes of transport).The sector has seen steady growth of 5.8% from 474 million in 1995 to 502 million in 2004. It is estimated that the annual volume of international bus and coach passengers amounts to 72.8 million passengers. In contrast to other modes of transport (notably air transport), there are neither international agreements (with the exception of the United Nations – Economic Commission for Europe Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Passengers and Luggage by Road (CVR), ratified by only three Member States) nor Community legislation establishing bus and coach passenger rights. Protection of bus and coach passengers varies from one Member State to another. Rules on liability of operators tend to vary significantly, while compensation and assistance in the event of interrupted journeys are not generalised. In its Communication of 22 June 2006, the Commission committed itself to examining how to increase quality of service and assurance of passenger rights in all modes of transport. With regard to coach transport, the Commission identified three main areas of concern: 1) the rights of persons with reduced mobility, 2) liability issues and 3) compensation and assistance in the event of interrupted travel. CONTENT: the proposal aims at establishing rights of coach and bus passengers in order to improve the attractiveness of and confidence in coach and bus transport as well as to achieve a level playing field between carriers from different Member States and between other modes of transport. In principle the proposal lays down provisions on: liability in the event of death or injury of passengers and loss of or damage to their luggage; non-discrimination on grounds of nationality or place of residence with regard to transport conditions offered to passengers by bus or coach undertakings, assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility; obligations of bus and coach undertakings in the event of cancellation or delay of a journey; information obligations; handling of complaints; general rules on enforcement. The proposal for a Regulation will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Treaty by ensuring an enhanced level of consumer protection, combating discrimination and social exclusion of persons with disabilities and allowing European citizens to take full advantage of the opportunities created by the internal market. Establishing and further strengthening the rights of passengers reflects the high priority given by the Amsterdam Treaty to the protection of consumers. The present proposal regarding the rights of passengers in bus and coach services is consistent with the objectives of combating social exclusion, as it establishes the principle of non-discrimination and assistance for disabled people. The proposal is also in line with Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it also ties in with Article 13 of the EC Treaty, which enables the Community to combat discrimination in the areas of Community competence."
7445EP8,"""""Enforcement requirements and specific rules for posting drivers in the road transport sector""""",0.714,0.507,0.06,0.062,0.096,0.701,0.22,0.019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to adapt social rules applying to the road transport sector in order to ensure a balance between the drivers' social protection and operators' freedom to provide cross-border services. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: among the main social rules applying to the transport sector are the following: provisions on the organisation of drivers' working time set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; minimum requirements for enforcement set out in Directive 2006/22/EC; rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods under Regulation (EC) No 561/2006; provisions on posting of workers established in Directive 96/71/EC and the enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU. The current evaluation of the social legislation in road transport in the EU has shown shortcomings in the current legal framework and problems regarding enforcement. Furthermore, a number of discrepancies exist between Member States in interpretation, application and implementation of the rules. This creates legal uncertainty and unequal treatment of drivers and operators, which is detrimental to the working, social and competition conditions in the sector. The Commission aims to amend the existing rules in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable, whilst at the same time mitigating the excessive regulatory burdens on operators and preventing distortions of competition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four options were considered. The first policy option focused on clarifying the legal framework and increasing cooperation between enforcement authorities. The second focused on strengthening enforcement and improving working patterns for workers. The third proposed substantive changes in the rules, in particular banning performance based pay. The fourth option comprised sector specific criteria and specific enforcement measures for the posting of workers in the road transport sector. Significant savings for operators result mainly from the latter option, and in particular the measures on administrative and control requirements. These savings are in the range of EUR 785 million per year in administrative costs. CONTENT: the proposal makes a limited number of amendments to Directive 2006/22/EC and lays down sector-specific rules on posting of workers in the road transport sector in relation to Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU. Requirements on enforcement : the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2006/22/EC in order to: require that checks carried out by Member States include checking compliance with the working time provisions set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; require that the information submitted by Member States to the Commission on the results of checks at the roadside and at premises to include checks on compliance with Directive 2002/15/EC; specify that serious infringements giving rise to checks at premises of road transport undertakings shall also include infringements of Directive 2002/15/EC; improve administrative cooperation between Member States with regard to the implementation of the social rules in road transport has proven insufficient, making cross-border enforcement more difficult, inefficient and inconsistent. It is therefore necessary to establish a framework for effective communication and mutual assistance, including exchange of data on infringements and information on good practices in enforcement; further improve the effectiveness, and consistency of the existing national risk rating systems : the Commission will establish a uniform formula for calculating the risk rating of transport undertakings, and take into account certain criteria, such as the use of the 'smart' tachygraph. Data in the risk rating system must be made available to control authorities. Posting of workers : the Commission proposes that drivers are considered as posted workers if they spend at least 3 days in a given calendar month on the territory of a Member State. All cabotage operations will be considered as posting of workers from day 1 – regardless of their duration. The minimum rate of pay and the minimum annual paid holidays of the host Member State should apply to cabotage irrespective of the frequency and duration of the operations carried out by a driver. For the purposes of the calculation of the periods of posting: a daily working period shorter than six hours spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as half a day; a daily working period of six hours or more spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as a full day; breaks and rest periods as well as periods of availability spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as working period. The proposal lays down the specific administrative requirements and control measures for checking compliance with the provisions on posting of workers in road transport."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaries of a Channel fixed link, signed in Canterbury on 12 February 1986, established an intergovernmental committee to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transition period set out in the withdrawal agreement, unless otherwise provided, EU law will no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and, as regards the part of the Channel Fixed Link under French jurisdiction, the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be a national safety authority under Union law. The safety authorisations for the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager and safety certificates for railway undertakings operating through the Fixed Link issued by the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be valid. By Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council, France was empowered to negotiate, sign and conclude an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety and interoperability rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link, with the aim of maintaining a unified safety regime. However, it is unlikely that such agreement will enter into force by the end of the transition period. In the light of the economic importance of the Channel Fixed Link to the EU, it is essential that the Channel Fixed Link continue to operate after 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in view of the end of the transitional period referred to in the withdrawal agreement, the proposed Regulation lays down transitional provisions for certain safety certificates and safety approvals issued under Directive 2004/49/EC and for certain licences of railway undertakings issued under Directive 2012/34/EU. In concrete terms, the proposal: - extends the validity of safety authorisations of the infrastructure manager by two months and the validity of safety certificates and licences of railway undertakings by nine months; - also extends by nine months the validity of the operating licences issued by the United Kingdom under Directive 2012/34/EU in order to allow railway undertakings to continue to operate up to the Calais-Fréthun border-crossing station and thus ensure connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom; - provides that such authorisations, certificates and licences are subject to Directive (EU) 2016/798 and Directive 2012/34/EU respectively and requires their holders of to cooperate with the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority and provide the necessary information; the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority must monitor that the holders of these authorisations, certificates and licences comply with EU law; - confers implementing powers on the Commission to withdraw the benefit conferred on the holders of the approvals/certificates and licences in question, where compliance with EU requirements is not ensured."
3090EP7,"""""Pharmacovigilance (amendment of Directive 2001/83/EC)""""",0.877,0.894,0.86,0.613,0.545,0.892,0.882,0.943,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 2001/83/EC as regards pharmacovigilance in order to address weaknesses identified in the EU pharmacovigilance system. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in December 2010, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 (""2010 pharmacovigilance legislation"") amending respectively, as regards pharmacovigilance, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The new legislation will apply from July 2012. These measures have substantially strengthened the legal framework for the surveillance of medicinal products, with provisions to reinforce the coordinating role of the Agency, the possibilities for signal detection, and the operation of coordinated procedures at European level to respond to safety concerns. However, recent pharmacovigilance events in the European Union, in particular the “Mediator case”, have shown the need for a further improvement of the pharmacovigilance system. Following an analysis of the Mediator case in the light of the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation (""Stress test""), the Commission has detected certain weaknesses in the pharmacovigilance system that need to be addressed. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 and Article 168(4)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the general policy objectives of the proposals to amend Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medicinal products for human use and to protect better the health of EU citizens. Following this line, the proposals aim specifically to address weaknesses identified in the EU pharmacovigilance system and provide for more transparency and efficiency of the system in cases where safety concerns are identified. The main amendments to the Regulation are as follows: Automatic assessment at EU level : Directive 2001/83/EC provides for an automatic assessment at Union level when specific serious safety issues have been identified with regard to nationally authorised products. In the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation, changes to the Commission's proposal during co-decision have led to the automatic assessment being lost, as the initiation of the procedure is linked to an appreciation by the Member State or the Commission as to whether an urgent action is considered necessary. Thus, when a Member State considers suspending, revoking or refusing renewal of a marketing authorisation, but does not consider that urgent action is needed, no evaluation of the safety concern will be conducted at Union level. Recent pharmacovigilance events in the Union have shown the need for an automatic procedure at Union level in the cases of specific safety issues to ensure that a matter is assessed and addressed in all Member States where the medicinal product is authorised. The scope of different Union procedures concerning nationally authorised products is clarified in the text. Transparency : marketing authorisation holders are not required to declare the reasons for the withdrawal of a marketing authorisation or product. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that voluntary withdrawal of a marketing authorisation or product by the marketing authorisation holder could lead to safety issues being missed, in particular if the company is not transparent about possible safety concerns. Voluntary action by the marketing authorisation holder should not lead to a situation where concerns related to the risks or benefits of a medicinal product authorised in the Union are not properly addressed in all Member States. Therefore, provision is made for the marketing authorisation holder to inform competent authorities of the reasons for the withdrawal of a medicinal product, for interrupting the placing on the market of a medicinal product, for requests for revoking a marketing authorisation, or for not renewing a marketing authorisation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the budget of the Union. It makes minor changes to the system set forth by the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation, and does not require additional human or administrative resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the POPs Regulation) implements the commitments of the Union under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Stockholm Convention) approved by Council Decision 2006/507/EC and under the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs Protocol). The recast of the POP Regulation is proposed for the following reasons: in view of the procedural changes introduced by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the 'Lisbon Treaty'), it is necessary to adapt the provisions of the POPs Regulation concerning comitology by specifying which rules are subject to implementing acts and clarified which conditions apply to the adoption of delegated acts; in order to support the Commission in its tasks foreseen under the POPs Regulation, it is proposed to: (i) involve the European Chemicals Agency in certain administrative, technical and scientific tasks necessary for the implementation of the Regulation; (ii) support the enforcement of the POPs Regulation by Member States by including a coordination role for the Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (REACH); in light of the experience of the functioning of the procedures under the POPs Regulation, it is proposed to include certain technical amendments to the operative provisions, such as clarifying existing definitions and adding the definitions of manufacturing, use and a closed-system site-limited intermediate and to update the provisions of the reporting requirements. The proposal contributes to the achievement of priority objective 3 of the 7th Environment Action Programme to 2020: ‘to safeguard the Union’s citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and well-being’. CONTENT: the recast proposal contains provisions concerning the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the reporting of information on their manufacture, use and emissions. It also lays down obligations on the monitoring of the application of the POP Regulation. It also requires the establishment and regular review of an implementation plan for the Stockholm Convention. The proposed recast Regulation would essentially maintain all provisions of the current POPs Regulation, including those that go beyond the requirements of the Stockholm Convention and the POPs Protocol. In order to enhance clarity and improve the functioning of the Regulation. The main changes are as follows: Clarification of definitions : the definitions for ‘placing on the market’, ‘article’, ‘substance’, ‘waste’, ‘disposal’ and ‘recovery’ have been amended. The term ‘preparation’ has been replaced by ‘mixture’ to reflect the changes in the general chemicals legislation. It has also been proposed to add definitions for 'manufacturing', 'use' and 'closed-system, site-limited intermediate'. Involvement of the European Chemicals Agency : a role for the Agency in the implementation of this Regulation has been proposed due to the Agency's expertise and experience with the implementation of general chemicals legislation and international agreements on chemicals, in particular regarding its current involvement in REACH and Regulation (EU) No 649/2012. It is proposed that the role of the Agency will include its involvement in the technical preparation of dossiers on substances that may be used by the Commission, should it use its discretion to propose one or more such substances to be listed as POPs in the Stockholm Convention. In particular, the Agency will take action where substances are considered to fulfil the criteria in Annex D of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, the Commission, the Member States and the Agency should cooperate to implement effectively the Union's international obligations under the Convention. Role of the REACH ‘Forum’ : the Forum is a network of authorities responsible for the enforcement of REACH, Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP) and Regulation (EC) 649/2012 (PIC) in the EU. As a result of the experience it has accrued in relation to those chemical regulations, it is deemed appropriate to propose a role for the Forum in coordinating the enforcement tasks specified in this Regulation. Comitology : in order to take account of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it is proposed to revise the provisions by which certain powers are conferred on the European Commission. Reporting and monitoring : the recast includes certain adjustments, in particular with regard to streamlining, simplifying and automatising the reporting and monitoring process, and improving the provision of public information. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal is not expected to have important budgetary implications since no new tasks were introduced compared to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. The transfer of certain tasks from the Commission to the Agency is expected to have no significant impact on the overall costs of implementation. Reductions are expected to be achieved in the medium-term considering the potential for synergies with other existing tasks of the Agency. The financing of the tasks carried out by the Agency will be provided in form of a subsidy from the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the GFCM Agreement provides an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation to promote the development, conservation, rational management and best utilisation of living marine resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels which are considered sustainable and at low risk of collapse. The European Union, as well as Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Romania and Slovenia are contracting parties to the GFCM Agreement. At its Annual Sessions in 2011 and 2012, the GFCM adopted measures for the sustainable exploitation of red coral in its area of competence to be implemented in Union law. The GFCM adopted other recommendations laying down: measures for the mitigation of incidental catches of seabirds, sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans in fishing activities in the GFCM Agreement area to be implemented in Union law; measures aiming to ensure in its area of competence a high level of protection from fishing activities to sharks and rays, and in particular to the shark and ray species listed as endangered or threatened under Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean to the Barcelona Convention; measures for fisheries exploiting small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea which should be implemented in Union law. Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM Agreement area. It is proposed to amend this Regulation to include the measures contained in the GFCM recommendations. CONTENT: the proposal contains technical measures for the sustainable exploitation of red coral, the mitigation of incidental captures of seabirds, sea turtles and cetaceans and the conservation of monk seals, sharks and rays in the GFCM Agreement area. Such measures go beyond the protection already ensured to these species at EU level by the Habitats Directive and other Union acts and include specific recording and reporting obligations for both operators and Member States. The proposal also implements in Union law certain measures for fisheries for small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: it is increasingly becoming recognised that freedom from crime and from feelings of personal insecurity is an important aspect of citizens' well-being. Until now, there is no survey data on crime and safety of individuals and households covering the whole EU. Administrative data on crime (based on police reports etc.) have been collected on an informal basis and published since 2006. It is generally acknowledged that such data have restricted comparability due to the differing legal systems and recording methods in the Member States, and that the potential for overcoming these difficulties is limited. The European Council highlighted the lack of comparable information at EU level on crime in the Hague Programme in 2005. In response, the Commission drew up an Action Plan 2006-2010 on improving methods to measure crime, which included developing an EU household survey on crime victimisation. The Stockholm Programme (2009) underlined the need to follow up this work with practical implementation. It is therefore proposed to conduct in 2013 an EU-level survey based on the methodology which has now been agreed with the stakeholders. It would make available information on the prevalence of specific types of crime (victimisation rates) and on other aspects relating to citizens’ feelings of security. This would provide a valuable addition to crime figures from administrative sources (such as police reports), which are known to be difficult to compare between Member States. ANALYSIS OF EFFECTS AND IMPLICATIONS: the proposed survey on crime and safety will for the first time make available information from every Member State on a topic which is of central importance to EU policy concerns. The use of common methodologies and reporting formats will make data available which will be coherent, comparable and thus relevant for users at both European and national level. The Member States will play a key role in this exercise through the involvement of national statistical authorities, which have well-established procedures for collecting and processing survey data. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he objective of this Regulation is to establish a common framework for producing European statistics on safety from crime, via the collection, compilation, processing and transmission by the Member States of harmonised European data on crime and safety based upon a household/personal survey. The aim of the proposal is to harmonise concepts, subjects covered and characteristics of the required information, coverage, quality criteria and reporting deadlines and results, to achieve relevant, timely, comparable and coherent European statistics. Member States will collect the data using their own national sampling frames, and will also select the interview mode (face-to-face interviews, telephone, postal, web-based, etc.) in line with established national practices. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal implies expenditure of EUR 12 million in 2012 from the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Eurostat’s rail transport statistics are predominantly based on Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1192/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 332/2007. These Regulations cover passenger and freight transport by rail, as well as rail safety. The Commission needs statistics on the transport of goods and passengers by rail in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy. Detailed rail transport statistics for goods and passengers and information on intermodality are necessary to monitor the targets set in the 2011 Commission’s White Paper. Eurostat has conducted a technical analysis of the existing data on rail statistics collected under the Union legislation and of the dissemination policy, within its Working Group and Task Force on rail transport statistics. In its report to the European Parliament and the Council on the experience acquired in the application of the Regulation (EC) No 91/2003, the Commission mentions that long term developments will probably mean the suppression or simplification of the data already collected under the Regulation, and that the intention is to reduce the data transmission period for annual data on rail passengers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal is the result of in-depth negotiations between all interested parties. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is thus to modify Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 in order to update, simplify and optimise the existing legal framework for European statistics on rail transport and to align it with the new institutional context. Data on transport of passengers : in line with Annexes C and D to Regulation (EC) 91/2003 on rail transport statistics, countries are currently required to provide annual statistics on passenger transport, under detailed and/or simplified reporting. The Commission proposed to delete Annex D (simplified reporting) and the provisional Tables C1 and C2 in Annex C, while shortening the deadline for providing the final passenger data from 14 months to eight months after the end of the reference period. Data on transport of goods : in the interests of consistency, it is also proposed to delete Annex B (simplified reporting). New Annex : as it is proposed to abandon the current concept of ‘simplified’ reporting, for the smallest undertakings below the specified thresholds, Member States would have to report a ‘total’ figure for aggregated indicators in Annex L. Data on accidents : as data on accidents are also collected by the European Rail Agency, it is proposed to delete Annex H (statistics on accidents). Annex I : as the concept of ‘simplified’ reporting will disappear, it is proposed to delete this Annex as it is currently used only to validate coverage between simplified and detailed reporting in relation to the total rail activity of undertakings. Thresholds : the present thresholds are established for tonne-km and passenger-km, i.e. multiplication of tonnes/passengers transported and the distance covered in kilometres. As significant rail activity involves only small distances in some Member States, it is proposed to decrease the thresholds both for goods and passengers, in order to minimise the loss of important data. For the same reason, a double threshold in tonnes transported and in tonne-km is proposed for goods. Transit data : it is proposed that ‘Rail Waybill’ information (if available) be used when administrative data are used as the data source. Lastly, the proposed amendment of Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 takes into account the necessary adjustments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards granting the Commission delegated and implementing powers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
5182EP7,"""""Gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges""""",0.035,0.663,0.842,0.032,0.273,0.494,0.826,0.457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: ensuring more balanced representation of men and women among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: company boards in the EU are characterised by persistent gender imbalances, as evidenced by the fact that only 13.7% of corporate seats in the largest listed companies are currently held by women (15% among non-executive directors). Progress in increasing the presence of women on company boards has been very slow, with an average annual increase in the past years of just 0.6 percentage points. The divergence or the absence of regulation at national level does not only lead to the discrepancies in the number of women among executive and non-executive directors and different rates of improvement across Member States, but also poses barriers to the internal market by imposing divergent corporate governance requirements on European listed companies. The European Commission reaffirmed its support for an increased participation of women in positions of responsibility, both in its Women's Charter and its Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-2015. In the European Pact for Gender Equality 2011-2020, adopted on 7 March 2011, the Council acknowledged that gender equality policies are vital to economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness and urged action to promote the equal participation of women and men in decision-making at all levels and in all fields. The European Parliament, in its resolutions of 6 July 2011 and 13 March 2012, called upon companies and Member States to increase female representation of women in decision-making bodies and invited the Commission to propose legislative quotas to attain the critical threshold of 30 per cent female membership of management bodies by 2015 and 40 per cent by 2020. The European social partners have reaffirmed their commitment to further action in this area in their work programme for 2012-2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed five policy options: Option 1 : the baseline scenario (i.e. no further action at EU level); Option 2: a Commission Recommendation encouraging Member States to achieve the objective of at least 40% of board members of each gender by 2020; Option 3: a Directive introducing a binding objective of at least 40% of each gender by 2020 for non-executive directors; Option 4: a Directive introducing a binding objective of at least 40% of board members of each gender by 2020 for non-executive directors and a flexible objective for executive directors, which would be set by the companies themselves; Option 5: a Directive introducing a binding objective of at least 40% of board members of each gender by 2020 for both executive and non-executive directors. The outcome of the comparison of the consequences of the different policy options was that (i) binding measures are more effective in meeting the policy objectives than non-binding measures, (ii) measures that target both executive and non-executive board members are more effective than measures only targeting one group and (iii) binding measures will generate more societal and economic benefits than non-binding measures. The proposal is therefore based on Option 4. LEGAL BASIS: Article 157(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to substantially increase the number of women on corporate boards throughout the EU by setting a minimum objective of a 40% presence of the under-represented sex among the non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges and by requiring companies with a lower share of the under-represented sex among the non-executive directors to introduce pre-established, clear, neutrally formulated and unambiguous criteria in selection procedures for those positions in order to attain that objective by 1 January 2020. A shorter deadline for achieving the objective (1 January 2018) is set for listed companies which are public undertakings. The proposal: specifies the method of calculation of the exact number of non-executive director positions necessary to meet the 40% objective; imposes a preference rule with the aim of meeting the objective: in the presence of equally qualified candidates of both sexes, priority shall be given to the candidate of the under-represented sex unless an objective assessment taking account of all criteria specific to the individual candidates tilts the balance in favour of the candidate of the other sex. This procedural requirement is necessary to ensure that the objectives comply with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning positive action; imposes a disclosure obligation and a burden of proof rule applicable in cases of challenges to the selection procedure by an unsuccessful candidate; provides for a possibility of justifying non-compliance with the objective where the members of the under-represented sex represent less than 10 per cent of the workforce; provides that the 40% objective can also be met where the members of the under-represented sex hold at least one third of all director positions, irrespective of whether they are executive or non-executive; imposes an obligation for listed companies to undertake individual commitments regarding the representation of both sexes among executive directors; imposes an obligation for listed companies to provide and publish information on the gender composition of their boards; imposes on listed companies which fail to meet the objectives concerning the non-executive directors or commitments concerning executive directors an additional obligation to explain the reasons and to include the description of measures taken and planned in order to meet the objectives or commitments in the future; obliges Member States to lay down rules on sanctions applicable in case of breach of this Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Japan is the world’s third largest economy outside of the EU in terms of GDP, yet only EU's seventh largest trading partner. It has a population of over 127 million inhabitants with a very high purchasing power. It is a key market for European Union exporters, services providers and investors. On 29 November 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Japan. The Free Trade Agreement with Japan was renamed the ""Economic Partnership Agreement"" (the EPA) at the time of the conclusion of an agreement in principle on 6 July 2017. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2012, the Commission has negotiated with Japan an ambitious and comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners. The texts of the EPA after the finalisation of the negotiations were published in December 2017. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission notably secured the following: Joint committee: the EPA establishes a Joint committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the Agreement. It shall be comprised of representatives of the EU and of Japan who will meet once a year or in urgent cases at the request of either side. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EPA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It will lead to an estimated loss of duties of EUR 970 million at the entry into force of the Agreement. After the EPA is fully implemented (after 15 years from its entry into force) the yearly loss of duties is estimated to reach EUR 2.084 billion. This estimation is based on a projection of the evolution of trade for the next 15 years without any agreement. On the other hand, the EPA is not expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is a continuation of the ‘ European Green Deal ’ which reaffirms the Commission’s ambition to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. In its Communication of 28 November 2018 ‘A clean planet for all’, the Commission already set out its strategic long-term vision of a Union with zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 through a socially fair and cost efficient transition. The European Parliament endorsed the EU's long-term objective of climate neutrality. It called for the necessary transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050 at the latest, expressing the wish that this transition should become a true European success story and declared the climate and environmental urgency in its resolution of 28 November 2019. The European Council has set building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe as one of the main four priorities in its Strategic Agenda for 2019-2024. It also endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, while recognising the need to put in place an enabling framework and that the transition will require significant public and private investments. The EU has put in place a comprehensive framework of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has already started to modernise and transform the economy with the aim of climate neutrality. Between 1990 and 2018, it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 23%, while the economy grew by 61%. Despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Commission considers it imperative to take further action, involving all sectors, as current policies are expected to only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2050. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to complement the existing policy framework by setting the long-term direction of travel and enshrining the 2050 climate-neutrality objective in EU law, enhancing adaptation efforts, establishing a process to set out and review a trajectory until 2050, regular assessment and a process in case of insufficient progress or inconsistencies. Its aim is to: - provide a direction by setting a pathway to climate neutrality, and enhance certainty and confidence on the EU’s commitment for businesses, workers, investors and consumers, as well as transparency and accountability, thus sustaining prosperity and job creation; - contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, including its long-term goal to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to below 1.5°C as well as to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Climate neutrality target for 2050 The proposal sets out the EU's climate neutrality objective for 2050, which covers all sectors and all greenhouse gases (not just CO2) and applies to the whole Union. It also obliges the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Member States to take, at their respective levels, the necessary measures to achieve this objective. The proposal also sets out the way forward to achieve the 2050 target: - by September 2020, the Commission shall present a plan with an impact assessment to increase the EU's 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target to at least 50% and move towards 55% below 1990 levels in a responsible manner. If necessary, it shall propose amending EU climate law accordingly; - by 30 June 2021 at the latest, the Commission shall assess and propose to revise, if appropriate, all relevant policy instruments in order to achieve the additional greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030. Trajectory towards climate neutrality For the period 2030 to 2050, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by setting out a trajectory at Union level to achieve over time the 2050 objective. The Commission shall review the EU trajectory every 5 years. Under the Paris Agreement, the Parties periodically take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assess the collective progress made in achieving its purpose and long-term goals (the so-called ‘global stocktaking’ exercise). At the latest within six months of each global stocktake, the Commission shall review the trajectory. Adaptation to climate change The proposal obliges the relevant EU institutions and Member States to ensure that steady progress is made in improving adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. To this end, Member States shall adopt comprehensive national adaptation strategies and plans. Regular assessment By 30 September 2023 at the latest, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall assess the progress made, in line with the deadlines set out in the Paris Agreement. If the assessment shows that EU measures are inconsistent or inadequate in relation to the objective pursued, or that progress is insufficient, the Commission shall take appropriate action. The Commission shall also regularly assess relevant national measures and issue recommendations where it finds inconsistencies or that measures are inadequate.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called “Open Skies” cases, on 5 June 2003 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral air services agreements with an agreement at Union level (the “horizontal authorisation”). The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks to approve on behalf of the Union the Agreement between the European Union and the Philippines on certain aspects of air services. The Agreement replaces certain provisions of the existing bilateral air services agreements concluded between the Member States and the Republic of the Philippines: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. - Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the European Union. In particular, it also contains rules on public procurement. Following the adoption of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC and of Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the award of concession contracts, provision should be made for the rules contained in these Directives to apply to contracts awarded by the European institutions on their own account. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union in order to take account of the new directives on public procurement and on the award of concession contracts awarded by the European institutions on their own account. The modifications brought about to the text of the Financial Regulation (FR) can be classified into three main groups. Alignment with the Directive : new provisions are introduced, such as market consultation, the new innovation partnership as a procedure, the introduction of compliance with environmental, social and labour law as a key requirement, evaluation of criteria in no particular order, award methodology based on the most economically advantageous tender. In addition, concessions for works and services are introduced for the first time in the FR and are subject to the same types of procedures as public contracts. Provisions on exclusion : the grounds for exclusion are clarified and aligned with the Directive as well as the possibility for the economic operator concerned to take remedial measures. Exclusion is clearly separated from the rejection from a given procedure to avoid confusion. A single system is set up for increasing the protection of the Union financial interests which takes into account the existing Central Exclusion Database. The aim of the system is to ensure the early detection and prevention of risk as well as the publication of information related to excluded economic operators. An exclusion panel is set up to take exclusion decisions after the analysis of the case and it guarantees the right of defence of economic operators. Clarifications of the text and simplifications : these concern publicity measures above and below thresholds, requirements for opening and evaluation, rejection of non-compliant tenders, bank guarantees for works and complex services contracts, the fact that Union institutions are considered central contracting authorities according to the Directive, the reference to applicable Directive thresholds, electronic procedures and the opening up of procurement by institutions to international organisations."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: conflict of laws rules governing the third-party (or proprietary) effects of assignments of claims do not currently exist at Union level. These conflict of laws rules are laid down at Member State level, but they are inconsistent and often unclear. In cross border assignments of claims, the inconsistency of national conflict of laws rules leads to legal uncertainty as to which law applies to the third-party effects of the assignments. The assignment of a claim is a legal mechanism whereby a creditor (""assignor"") transfers his right to claim a debt to another person (""assignee""). A claim gives a creditor the right to receive a sum of money or to the performance of an obligation by the debtor. This mechanism is used by companies to obtain liquidity and have access to credit, so-called factoring and collateralisation respectively, and by companies (most often banks) to optimise the use of their capital, also called securitisation. Factoring is a crucial source of liquidity for many firms. The majority of users of factoring are SMEs: Small represent 76%, Medium 11% and Large 13%. Europe as a region is the largest factoring market world-wide and represents 66% of the world market. As part of the Action Plan on Capital Markets Union (CMU) and the Mid-Term Review, the Commission announced targeted action on rules on the ownership of securities and the third-party effects of assignments of claims to reduce legal uncertainty for cross-border transactions in securities and claims. This proposal and the Communication on the law applicable to the proprietary effects of transactions in securities, presented in parallel, implement this commitment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five options have been studied in the impact assessment. The proposal is based on the option that the law of the assignor's habitual residence is a general rule but with certain assignments subject, as an exception, to the law of the assigned claim and with a choice of law possibility for securitisation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation concerns the law applicable to cross-border transactions involving claims or securities. It does not cover the transfer of the contracts (for example derivative contracts), in which both rights (or claims) and obligations are included. The proposal aims to: contribute to the objective of encouraging cross-border investment by reducing the legal uncertainty that may discourage cross-border assignments of claims or lead to additional costs for those transactions; protect investors by reducing losses that may occur when market participants are unaware of the legal risk arising from legal uncertainty; harmonise the conflict of law rules on the third-party effects of assignments of claims, the proposal will provide legal certainty to parties involved in factoring, collateralisation and securitisation and thereby facilitate access to cheaper finance for SMEs and consumers. The solution which the Commission proposes is a general rule that in conflict situations the law of the assignor's habitual residence applies. The law of the assignor's habitual residence is easy to determine and most likely to be the place in which the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the assignor will be opened. The proposal is also particularly suitable for bulk assignments and assignments of receivables under future contracts, which are an important source of finance for SMEs. It is the only law which is consistent with the Union acquis on insolvency, that is, the Insolvency Regulation. The Commission proposes, however, that the law of the assigned claim applies to two types of specific claims, which are therefore exempted from the general rule: cash on the account of a credit institution (for example a bank, where the consumer is the creditor and the credit institution is the debtor); claims derived from financial instruments, such as derivatives. In addition, for securitisation transactions, the Commission proposes a choice between the law of the assignor and the law of the assigned claim."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: trafficking in human beings is considered one of the most serious crimes worldwide, a gross violation of human rights, a modern form of slavery, and an extremely profitable business for organised crime. It is reasonable to estimate from the available figures that every year several hundred thousand people are trafficked into the EU or within the EU area. The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings provides a comprehensive and coherent framework covering prevention, cooperation between different actors, protection of and assistance to victims, and an obligation to criminalise trafficking in human beings. Implementing such measures would lead to significant improvements. The Convention has been ratified by 16 EU Member States. Another 10 have signed it and are going through the ratification process. Framework Decision 2002/629/EC on combating trafficking in human beings was adopted in 2002 as a response to a generally perceived need to address the serious criminal offence of trafficking in human beings at EU level. In order to tackle recent developments in the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings, the proposed Directive adopts a broader concept of what should be considered trafficking in human beings than under Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA and therefore includes additional forms of exploitation. The fight against trafficking in human beings requires coordinated efforts by Member States, as well as cooperation at an international level in order to achieve the aims. Differences in legal treatment in the different Member States hinder coordinated efforts and hamper international law enforcement and judicial cooperation. It is necessary to repeal the 2002 text. It should be noted that this proposal builds on a Commission proposal made on 25/03/2009 aiming to repeal the 2002 Framework Decision which has lapsed following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: various policy options were examined in connection with the previous proposal for a Framework Decision of 25 March 2009 with a view to preventing and combating trafficking in human beings more effectively, and better protecting victims. This is valid for the current proposal. Option 1 : no new EU action. Option 2 : non legislative measures: Framework Decision 2004/629/JHA would not be amended. Non-legislative measures could be put in place in the areas of victim support schemes, monitoring, prevention measures in countries of destination, prevention measures in countries of origin, training, and law enforcement cooperation. Option 3 : new legislation on prosecution, victim support, prevention and monitoring. This would incorporate the provision of the existing Framework Directive, along with certain provisions of the Council of Europe’s Convention and additional elements, particularly provisions in the areas of substantive criminal law, jurisdiction and prosecution, victims' rights in criminal proceedings, victim assistance, special protective measures for children, prevention, and monitoring. Option 4 : new legislation (as in option 3) + non legislative measures (as in option 2). A new legislative act would be adopted, incorporating the existing Framework Directive and including new provisions. The new legislative act would be supplemented by non-legislative measures, and in particular those identified in option 2. Following the analysis of economic impacts, social impacts, and impacts on fundamental rights, options 3 and 4 present the best approach to the problem and should fully achieve the identified objectives. The preferred option is option 4. LEGAL BASIS: Article 82(2) and Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The fight against trafficking in human beings requires coordinated efforts by Member States, as well as cooperation at an international level in order to achieve the aims. Differences in legal treatment in the different Member States hinder coordinated efforts and hamper international law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Action by the EU will better achieve the objectives of the proposal, which will approximate Member States' substantive criminal law and procedural rules more extensively than the current Framework Decision. This will have a positive impact on international law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and on the protection and assistance given to victims. The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of trafficking in human beings. It also aims to introduce common provisions to strengthen the prevention of the crime and the protection of its victims. The new directive, in addition to provisions in the current Framework Decision, would include the following new elements: Substantive criminal law provisions : these comprise definition; aggravating circumstances and penalties: the proposal sets out precise level of penalties adapted to the severity of the offences. An offence under this legislation is punishable by penalties of a maximum of at least five years of imprisonment, and ten years for aggravating circumstances; non application of penalties to the victim: Member States must provide for the possibility of not prosecuting or imposing penalties on victims of trafficking in human beings for their involvement in criminal activities they have been compelled to commit as a direct consequence of being subjected to any of the acts referred to in text. Jurisdiction and prosecution broader and more binding extraterritorial jurisdiction rule, obliging Member States to prosecute nationals and habitual residents who have committed the crime of trafficking outside the territory of the Member State; investigative tools- those responsible for investigating such offences should have access to the investigative tools used in organised crime or other serious crime cases such as interception of communications, covert surveillance including electronic surveillance, monitoring of bank accounts and other financial investigations. Victim assistance and support establishment of mechanisms for early identification and assistance of victims; standard of assistance including access to necessary medical treatment, counselling, and psychological assistance; special measures for child victims of trafficking. Protection of victims in criminal proceedings special treatment aimed at preventing secondary victimisation; protection on the basis of a risk assessment; legal counselling and representation, including for the purpose of claiming compensation. Prevention action aimed at discouraging the demand for sexual services and cheap labour; regular training for officials likely to come into contact with victims and potential victims; criminalisation of users of services exacted from a person, when the user knows that the person has been trafficked. Monitoring : establishment of National Rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms. The tasks of such mechanisms shall include the carrying out of assessments on trafficking in human beings trends, the measuring of results of anti-trafficking actions and reporting to the relevant national authorities. Territorial scope : the adoption of the proposal will be addressed to the Member States. The application of the resulting Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols (No 21) and (No 22) annexed to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: pursuant to the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, which is an integral part of the UK Withdrawal Agreement, medicines placed on the market in Northern Ireland must be covered by a valid marketing authorisation issued by the Commission (EU-wide authorisations) or the United Kingdom (UK) in respect of Northern Ireland. These national authorisations should be in compliance with the obligations of the EU acquis for medicinal products. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021) for maintaining batch testing and manufacturing / logistics in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to ensure undisrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it still proves very difficult for certain operators currently based in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to adapt and move relevant regulatory compliance functions (namely, the marketing authorisation holder, quality control (batch) testing, the qualified persons responsible for batch testing pharmacovigilance) to Northern Ireland or the EU in respect of nationally authorised products, as required by the Protocol. Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down rules concerning medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products intended to be placed on the market in the Member States. In order to avoid shortages of medicinal products and to ensure a high level of public health protection, these Directives need to be amended to provide for derogations for medicinal products supplied to Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland from parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal provides for derogations from Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to ensure the long-term continuity of supply of generic and innovative medicines to Northern Ireland from the UK and to address the remaining supply problems in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. The proposal exceptionally allows the following: - the marketing authorisation holder and the manufacturing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - batch checks may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch controls and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland or Malta will be able to purchase and obtain medicinal products from a third country (parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing authorisation and without the need to repeat batch checks; This proposal allows exceptionally that: - a marketing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the manufacturing authorisation holder may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the batch testing may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch testing and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland, or Malta may purchase and obtain medicines from a third country (parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing import authorisation and without re-testing the products; - the competent authorities of the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland may temporarily authorise the supply to patients in Northern Ireland of a medicinal product provided that (i) the medicinal product concerned has obtained a marketing authorisation issued by the competent authority of the United Kingdom for parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; and (ii) the medicinal product concerned is made available to patients or end-users only within the territory of Northern Ireland and is not made available in any Member State; - the UK should comply with EU legislation on the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products for human use when issuing marketing authorisations for Northern Ireland. Malta, Cyprus and Ireland will have certain derogations for a period of three years (until 31 December 2024). In these three countries, during this period, importers of medicinal products from the UK will not be required to hold manufacturing authorisations, nor will such medicinal products be required to undergo batch testing if such testing has already been carried out in the UK. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 as regards a derogation from certain obligations concerning investigational medicinal products made available in the United Kingdom with respect to Northern Ireland as well as in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between, firstly, the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts) and, secondly, the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In this context Regulation (EC) No 850/98 needs to be aligned with the new rules of the TFEU. Powers currently conferred upon the Commission by that Regulation should be reclassified into delegated and implementing powers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: it was not necessary to carry out an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main legal action is to identify the powers conferred upon the Commission in Regulation (EC) No 850/98 and to classify these as delegated or implementing powers. (1) The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts concerning: the division of regions into geographical areas; the amending of the rules for the use of mesh size combinations; the establishment of rules for obtaining the percentage of target species taken by more than one fishing vessel in order to ensure that such catch compositions are respected by all the vessels involved in the fishing operation; the drawing up of rules concerning the technical descriptions and method of use of authorised devices that might be attached to the fishing net, and which do not obstruct or diminish the effective mesh opening of the net; conditions under which vessels exceeding eight meters length overall shall be permitted to use beam trawls within certain waters of the Union; measures designed to address unexpectedly small or large recruitments of juveniles, changes in migration patterns or any other changes in the conservation status of fish stocks, with immediate effect. (2) Likewise, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts concerning: technical rules for measuring mesh sizes; square-meshed netting and twine thickness; technical rules related to the construction of netting materials; listing of devices that may obstruct or otherwise diminish the effective mesh opening in a fishing net; transmission of lists of vessels to which a special fishing permit to use beam trawls has been issued; technical rules related to measuring engine power and gear dimensions; the obligation of Member States to ensure that levels of fishing effort are not exceeded in certain areas of ICES Division IXa, and temporary measures where the conservation of stocks of marine organisms calls for immediate action. The implementing powers conferred upon the Commission, except those concerning the obligation of Member States to ensure that levels of fishing effort are not exceeded in certain areas of ICES Division IXa, should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: by Decision of 30 November 2009, the Council concluded the agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver. Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition. With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with Mauritius were successfully finalised by the initialling of the amending agreement on 11 November 2016. CONTENT: this proposal is presented to the Council to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver. The amendments introduced by the final agreement cover the following points: Duration of stay: the final agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Mauritius when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). A joint statement on the interpretation of the 90-day period over any 180-day period is attached to the amending agreement. Suspension of the agreement: the agreement provides that suspension of the waiver shall be lifted if the suspension is no longer required. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver remain unaffected by the amending agreement, including the territorial scope. The provisions of the agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for the performance of official controls to verify compliance with, inter alia, rules on food and feed safety. Under Article 118(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products, third country operators exporting animals and products of animal origin to the Union are required to respect the prohibition of the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion and yield increase, as well as the prohibition of the use of antimicrobials reserved for treatment of certain infections in humans in order to preserve the efficacy of those antimicrobials. Building on the One Health approach, Regulation (EU) 2019/6 provides for a wide range of concrete measures that will apply to EU operators in order to enhance the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and promote a more prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials in animals. This objective is also reflected in the Commission’s Farm to Fork Strategy, in which the Commission has set the ambitious target of reducing by 50% overall EU sales of antimicrobials used for farmed animals and in aquaculture by 2030.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: shrinking public budgets and the need for increased PES cost-effectiveness have prompted several Member States to undertake PES reforms in the shape of mergers with unemployment benefit providers, outsourcing of services to private providers, regionalisation and municipalisation of employment services, and enhancing service delivery through ICTs and self-service tools. Due to national diversity in terms of PES business models, instruments, labour market conditions and legal context PES have different levels of effectiveness when delivering labour market programmes. While Member States remain responsible for organising, staffing and running their PES, this legislative proposal establishes a European Network of Public Employment Services providing a platform for comparing their performance at European level, identifying good practices and fostering mutual learning in order to strengthen service capacity and efficiency. Skills : this legislative proposal aims to expand, reinforce and consolidate on-going initiatives for the benefit of all PES. A European network of PES established on solid legal ground would be able to increase comprehensively coordinated activities among PES and provide the network with legitimacy to act. A formalised structure is the pre-condition to increase the network’s potential to contribute to the development of innovative, evidence-based policy implementation measures in line with the Europe 2020 objectives. The proposed initiative could contribute to improved cost-efficiency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given that the legislative proposal will mostly have indirect impacts and that the main technical elements of the benchmarking and mutual learning initiative will be defined in a delegated act, an impact assessment was considered not to be proportionate. LEGAL BASIS: Article 149 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, an EU wide network of Public Employment Services (PES) is established for the period expanding from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The Network shall comprise: the Public Employment Services as nominated by the Member States, and, the Commission. Member States with regional autonomous Public Employment Services shall ensure adequate representation in the specific initiatives of the Network. Objectives : through this Network the incentive measure herewith foreseen shall contribute to: the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and its headline targets especially those dealing with employment; the better functioning of the labour markets in the EU; the better integration of labour markets; increased geographical and occupational mobility; combatting of social exclusion and integration of persons excluded from the labour market. Initiatives of the Network : the Network shall in particular: develop and implement European wide evidence-based benchmarking systems among public employment services based on the use of quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess PES performances and to gather evidence with a view to establishing an appropriate mutual learning vehicle. It shall also participate actively in the implementation of these activities by sharing data, knowledge and practices; provide mutual assistance, either in the form of peer-to-peer or group activities, through cooperation, exchanges of information, experience and staff between its members including support for the implementation of PES-related country-specific recommendations issued by the Council; adopt and implement a concept for modernising and strengthening PES in key areas; prepare reports in the employment field, at the request of either the Council, or the Commission or on its own initiative; contribute to the implementation of policy initiatives in the employment field; adopt and implement an annual programme that spells out its working methods, deliverables and additional details related to the implementation of the benchmarking systems. A reporting mechanism shall be established as well as an annual report from the network members. Cooperation : the Network shall cooperate with labour market stakeholders including other providers of employment services by involving them in relevant activities and meetings of the Network and by exchanging information and data. Financial Support for this incentive measure : the global resources for the implementation of this Decision shall be established within the framework of the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, the annual appropriations of which shall be authorised by the budgetary authority. Measures are also set out to define the functioning of the Network and its composition. General framework : the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts concerning a general framework for the delivery of the benchmarking and mutual learning initiatives including the methodology, the basic quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess PES performance, the learning instruments of the integrated mutual learning programme and the terms for participation in these initiatives. Review : four years after its entry into force, the Commission shall submit a report on the application of this Decision to the European Parliament. It shall assess to what extent the network has contributed to the achievement of the objectives and whether it fulfilled its tasks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission's proposal for a Multi-Annual Financial Framework includes a proposal of a EUR 958. 19 million on a European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation (PSCI) for the period 2014-2020. Funding for the enhanced cooperation between PES will come from the PSCI/PROGRESS/Employment section. An indicative annual amount of EUR 4 million is foreseen for the above described incentive measure. The legislative proposal is budget-neutral and does not require additional staff resources. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal includes a provision to grant the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts. This will mainly concern a delegated act for putting in place the general framework for the implementation of the benchmarking and mutual learning initiatives. The choice of using the legal instrument of delegated acts is justified as this will complement the basic act with more detailed non-essential elements (in this case the general framework)."
8191EP8,"""""Re-commitment of the remaining amounts committed to support the implementation of the Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 or the allocation thereof to other actions under the national programmes""""",0.1,0.765,0.82,0.271,0.0,0.851,0.827,0.673,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to allow the re-commitment of the remaining amounts committed to support the implementation of the Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 or the allocation thereof to other actions under the national programmes. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: The Commission has committed funds to Member States' national programmes under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece. Decision (EU) 2015/1601 was amended by Council Decision (EU) 2016/1754 to take account of legal admissions from Turkey. The Council decisions allowed the effective relocation, from Greece and Italy, of 34 705 applicants in need of international protection, as well as the legal admission, from Turkey, of 5 345 persons in need of international protection. These decisions have since ceased to apply. Of the EUR 843 million committed in 2016 to Member States' national programmes under the AMIF, some EUR 567 million are still available. However, payments should be made for these commitments before the end of 2018, after which the amounts will no longer be available to Member States for their national programmes under the AMIF. The Commission considers that Member States should be able to use the amounts available to continue to relocate by recommitting these amounts to the same action in national programmes or to allocate these amounts to other actions in the fields of migration and asylum, once the Council decisions are no longer valid. In addition, the target group of persons eligible for relocation should be broadened so that Member States have greater flexibility in the relocations they carry out. The AMIF is an important tool to complement EU actions in the fields of borders and security, in particular because it provides financial support for the establishment and operation of reception and registration centres (hotspots). Member States' needs in these areas remain considerable. CONTENT: The proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) aims to allow Member States to re-commit or transfer amounts within national programmes, through revisions to these national programmes, so as to promote EU priorities in the areas of migration and asylum, including relocation. In practical terms, the proposal: extends the period for the use of the funds concerned - by two years from the date of the approval by the Commission of the revised national programmes - in order to give Member States sufficient time to implement the actions to which the amounts have been re-committed or transferred; extends the target group of persons eligible for resettlement under the current AMIF, i.e. beneficiaries of international protection, to include applicants for international protection who are being transferred; makes it possible to re-commit amounts committed to supporting the implementation of Council decisions for the purpose of relocations, or to transfer these amounts to other actions defined in the Regulation establishing the AMIF, according to the needs of the Member States. Such re-commitment or transfer operations would be possible only once and would have to be duly justified in the context of a revision of the national programmes, which would have to be approved by the Commission; extends by a maximum of six months the deadline for decommitment of the remaining amounts committed to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601, so that Member States have sufficient time to review national programmes and make changes related to possible re-commitments or transfers of amounts."
3716EP7,"""""European venture capital funds""""",0.754,0.897,0.877,0.645,0.333,0.855,0.887,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to lay down uniform requirements for using the designation ""European Venture Capital Fund"" in order to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: venture capital provides finance to undertakings that are generally very small, in the initial stages of their corporate existence and display a strong potential for growth and expansion. While the United States, in the period from 2003-2010, channelled approximately EUR 131 billion into venture capital funds, European venture capital funds only managed to raise EUR 28 billion in this period. Compared with competing global centres of high-tech and innovation, most notably the United States, the European venture capital industry is fragmented and dispersed. In the reference period 2003-2010, funds dedicated to venture capital amounted to EUR 64 billion out of a total of EUR 437 billion invested in the wider field of private equity. As long as this bias in favour of private equity - a sector that invests in mature companies and organises leveraged buy-outs - persists, available funds are not channelled to equity finance to seed and start-up ventures that are at the make-or-break phase in their corporate development. The lack of financial resources that are currently directed towards venture capital is directly responsible for the sub-optimal size of the average European venture capital fund (VCF). In consequence, venture capital, at this stage, plays a minor role in the financing of SMEs. The absence of an efficient venture capital sector leads to European innovators and innovative business ventures punching below their commercial potential. This, in turn, has negative consequences for Europe's global competitiveness. Tackling these problems and supporting European entrepeneurs is therefore vital: · a thriving European venture capital market is an objective of the overall Europe 2020 Strategy, while the European Council of February 2011 called for the removal of remaining regulatory obstacles to cross border venture capital; · the European Commission undertook, in the Single Market Act, to ensure that by 2012 venture capital funds established in any Member State can raise capital and invest freely throughout the EU; · a new framework for venture capital funds is also one of the key priorities of the SME action plan which aims at fostering the growth of SMEs by improving their access to finance; · the Commission Communication entitled ""A roadmap to stability and growth"" also identified facilitating the access to venture capital as an important tool to boost growth within the EU. The proposed Regulation is complementary to the proposed Regulation on European Social Entrepreneurship Funds (EuSEFs). Both proposals aim to achieve different goals and both proposals, if adopted, will coexist as autonomous legal acts in mutual independence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. These alternatives contain a wide range of possible options: · introduce a new venture capital passport within Directive 2011/61/EC (AIFMD); · lower or abolish the thresholds of the AIFMD; · create special rules for venture capital as part of the implementing provisions of AIFM-D ('level 2'); · create a venture capital passport as a stand-alone legal instrument; · create an administrative network to enforce mutual recognition of national rules  governing venture capital or 'private placements'. The assessment concluded in favour of the creation of a venture capital passport as a stand-alone instrument. The preferred option is expected to benefit venture capital fund managers by improving their operating conditions in the EU, which will then lead to compliance and administrative cost reductions, and opening up new fund-raising opportunities. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT : the proposal aims principally at improving the reliability and legal certainty of marketing activities undertaken by operators using the designation ""European Venture Capital Fund"", by introducing: · uniform requirements for the managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Venture Capital Fund""; · requirements as to the investment portfolio , investment techniques and eligible undertakings that a qualifying venture capital fund may target; · uniform rules on which categories of investors a qualifying venture capital fund may target and on the internal organisation of the managers that market such qualifying funds. As managers of collective investment undertakings that operate under the designation ""European Venture Capital Fund"" will be subject to identical substantive rules across the EU, they will benefit from uniform requirements for registration and an EU-wide passport, which will help create a level playing field for all participants in the venture capital market. In respect of the registration and supervision of the managers of ""European Venture Capital Funds"" the proposal aims at striking a balance between the need for effective supervision of European venture capital funds, the interest of the competent national authorities where such funds are either domiciled or offered to the eligible categories of investors and the coordinating role of ESMA. The competent authority in the Member State where the manager of the qualifying ""European Venture Capital Fund"" is domiciled will verify the registration documents submitted by the applicant manager and, having assessed whether the applicant provides sufficient guarantee of its ability to comply with the requirements of the Regulation, will register the applicant. In supervising the registered manager, the competent authority that has registered the manager will cooperate with the competent authorities in those Member States where the qualifying fund is marketed. ESMA will maintain a central database listing all registered managers that are eligible to use the designation “European Venture Capital Fund.” BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no budgetary implications. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was created in 2002 to enable the EU to respond to major disasters inside the EU and in countries involved in accession negotiations. The instrument is generally meeting its objectives well but is considered not to be sufficiently responsive and visible and as far as certain criteria for its activation are concerned too complicated and not sufficiently clear. In 2005, the Commission presented a proposal for a new EUSF Regulation. While the proposal was favourably received by the European Parliament, it was not adopted in the Council. The Commission officially withdrew the proposal in June 2012. In October 2011, the Commission presented a Communication on the Future of the Solidarity Fund which contains an evaluation of the operations of the current instrument and proposes options for improving its functioning. This proposal is situated in the context of the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020. Moreover, the proposal complements the recent common proposal of the Commission and the High Representative for implementing arrangements of the Solidarity Clause enshrined in Article 222 TFEU which underlines the role of the Solidarity Fund as one of the key Union instruments in applying this provision of the Treaty. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. However, The 2011 Communication served as a basis for discussions with the Member States and the European Parliament and other stakeholders. LEGAL BASIS: the third subparagraph of Article 175 and Article 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the main objective of the proposal is to improve the functioning of the existing Solidarity Fund instrument by making it quicker to respond and more visible to citizens, simpler to use and its provisions clearer. This is to be achieved by a limited number of technical adjustments to the Regulation. The principles of the instrument remain unchanged as do its financing method outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the likely level of spending. The proposal contains those adjustments to the EUSF-Regulation that were discussed in the 2011 Communication on the Future of the Solidarity Fund: Scope : a clearer definition of the scope of the EUSF limited to natural disasters including man-made disaster that are the direct consequence of a natural disaster (cascading effects). This will eliminate existing legal uncertainties about the scope and thus avoid that applications are presented which do not meet the conditions. Exceptional mobilisation : a new and simple single criterion for the exceptional mobilisation of the EUSF for so-called extraordinary regional disasters based on a GDP-related threshold has been introduced. The lack of clarity under the current provisions about the conditions for exceptionally mobilising the EUSF will be eliminated by setting the damage threshold for regional disasters at 1.5% of GDP at NUTS 2 level. This will considerably simplify and speed up the preparation of applications by eligible States and their assessment by the Commission. At the same time it will significantly reduce the number of rejected applications as applicants will know from the outset whether the criterion is met. Advanced payments : the introduction of the possibility to make rapid advance payments upon request of the affected Member State, limited to 10% of the expected amount of the financial aid capped at EUR 30 million. Recoveries from the Member States from the Solidarity Fund and from the Cohesion Instruments (ERDF and Cohesion Fund) up to a maximum annual amount should be made available to the Solidarity Fund as assigned revenue in order to make commitments for advance payments available in the Union budget. In addition to including a specific provision in the Solidarity Fund Regulation this will also require including a provision in the Common Provisions Regulation relating to the Cohesion Policy Funds and in the transitional provisions relating to the current programming period. It is envisaged that the Commission will present an amending proposal to be adopted at the same time as the present proposal. Starting dates : the proposal includes a specific provision for slowly unfolding disasters such as drought. Defining the start of such disasters as the date at which the public authorities took the first counter-measures will eliminate legal difficulties stemming from the current obligation to submit applications within 10 weeks of the date of the first damage. Disaster prevention : provisions are included to encourage more effective disaster prevention, including full implementation of relevant Union legislation on prevention, the use of available Union funding for related investments and improved reporting on these actions. In the event that a disaster of the same nature as one for which the Fund was previously mobilised should occur and Union legislation has not been complied with, the Commission will seriously consider rejecting a new application or granting a reduced amount of aid only. Awarding aid : it is proposed to merge the decision awarding the aid and the implementation agreements into a single act. This administrative measure will help to speed up the processing of applications inside the Commission and therefore allow paying out aid more rapidly. Moreover, a number of further elements were included in the proposal, such as: a specific provision on the eligibility of VAT and the exclusion of Technical Assistance, a provision requiring respect for the Union acquis, a revised provision to avoid double financing, extended ex-post reporting on prevention measures, a provision on the use of the Euro and its conversion into national currencies. Further modifications : a number of modifications are introduced to bring the Regulation in line with the Financial Regulation as amended in 2012. This concerns not only terminology but in particular certain rules and obligations in relation the implementation of the Fund by Member States under the principle of shared management and by eligible candidate countries (countries negotiating the accession to the Union) under the principle of indirect management. In order not to put at risk the objectives of the Fund, i.e. to make financial assistance available as quickly as possible after the occurrence of a major disaster, it is however necessary to derogate from certain provisions of the Financial Regulation, in particular as concerns the normally time-consuming process of designating the implementing authorities, including those for audit and control, as well as regarding the timing of annual reporting. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the EUSF is not budgeted. Actual spending will depend on applications for aid submitted by eligible States following the (unpredictable) occurrence of natural disasters and the maximum amount of annual allocation available to the Fund as decided in the IIA. The proposal takes account of the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014 – 2020 which foresees maintaining the current mechanism whereby the necessary budgetary resources for awarding financial aid are raised over and above the MFF ceilings by a decision of the budget authority within a maximum annual allocation of EUR 500 million (2011 prices). The decision to express the maximum annual allocation of the Fund in 2011 prices (instead of current prices) is mirrored in the proposal by applying the same basis to the amount of EUR 3 billion which is one of the two damage threshold for defining 'major disasters'. The other threshold defined as 0.6% of gross national income is not affected. In cases where an advance has been paid its amount will be taken into account when the final contribution from the Fund is paid out."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community, which has been amended several times and quite substantially. The new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bringing them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the following: Charges for cross-border payments in euro According to the proposal, charges levied by a payment service provider on a payment service user in respect of cross-border payments in euro shall be the same as the charges levied by that payment service provider for corresponding national payments of the same value in the national currency of the Member State in which the payment service provider of the payment service user is located. In order to facilitate the functioning of the Internal Market, the proposal lays down the principle that payment service providers shall align the charges they levy for cross-border payments in euro with the charges they levy for comparable national payments made in the national currency of the Member State in which they are established, including where the euro is not the national currency of that Member State. Transparency obligations The proposal sets out transparency requirements relating to currency conversion practices. It therefore provides that consumers shall be fully informed of the amount of exchange charges before making a cross-border payment (for example, when using their card abroad, be it a cash withdrawal from an ATM or to pay by card at the point of sale). To allow comparability, currency conversion charges for all card payments shall be expressed in the same way, namely as percentage mark-ups over the latest available euro foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). These mark-ups shall be communicated to the payer prior to the initiation of the payment transaction. In order to facilitate the automation of payments, banks shall, where appropriate: (i) communicate to the user the user's International Payment Account Number Identifier (IBAN) and the bank's Business Identifier Code (BIC); (ii) indicate on the statement of accounts or in an annex to the statements, the user's IBAN and the bank's BIC. Compliance with obligations The proposal obliges Member States to provide for complaint procedures for alleged infringements of this Regulation, as well as effective out-of-court redress procedures for the settlement of disputes. Penalties may be imposed for infringements."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT: in view of the new amendments which have become necessary and following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it is necessary to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 and replace it with a new text. 1. Alignment with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) : the harmonisation of Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 with the new rules contained in the Treaty is based on classifying into delegated powers (Article 290 of the TFEU) and implementing powers (Article 291 of the TFEU) of the provisions adopted by the Commission pursuant to that Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1914/2006 laying down certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006). Following this exercise, a draft proposal recasting Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 has been drafted. Under this draft, the Legislator reserves the right to issue decisions concerning the essential elements of a specific scheme for certain agricultural products in the smaller Aegean islands, in order to remedy the difficulties caused by their isolation, remoteness, insularity, small size, mountainous terrain and climate and their economic dependency on a small number of products. The general guidelines for this scheme and the general principles which underpin it are determined by the Legislator. As such, the objectives of the measures introduced by this specific scheme and the principles regarding programming, compatibility and consistency with other EU policies are defined by the Legislator. The Legislator also establishes the principles for a certification scheme and the application of penalties, reductions and exclusions. - In accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU: the Commission may adopt, by means of a delegated act, the conditions for operators being registered in the register of certificates and can, if necessary (given the economic situation), require the lodging of a security for the issuing of certificates. The Legislator can also delegate to the Commission the power to adopt measures relating to the establishment of the procedure for approving amendments to the programme, conditions for processing, the conditions on establishing aid amounts and penalties. - In accordance with Article 291 of the TFEU: the Legislator may grant the Commission the power to implement, specifically with regard to the uniform conditions relating to the introduction of the system of certificates and the commitment of operators concerning the specific supply arrangements, the uniform conditions for implementing the programme and a general framework of checks which Greece must perform. 2. Substantive amendments : in view of the fact that since it was adopted, Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 has been the subject of several amendments, it is proposed that it be recast in the interests of clarity. Furthermore, changes in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation that have occurred since it was adopted also make it necessary to amend certain of its provisions and to restructure the legislative text so that it reflects more effectively the reality of this scheme. This new regulation is more explicit in setting out the scheme’s main objectives, the implementation of which the specific measures for agriculture in the smaller Aegean islands should contribute to. Its new structure highlights the central role played by the support programme, which has now been defined for the smaller Aegean islands at the most appropriate level and coordinated by Greece. This programme relates to the two fundamental elements of the specific supply arrangement and of the specific measures to assist local production. Other minor amendments have been made to the wording of the Regulation, in particular: · the procedure for submitting the programme and amendments for approval to the Commission has been specified to make it more consistent with current practice and in view of the need for greater flexibility and efficiency as regards the process of adapting the programme to meet the actual needs of agriculture and the supply of products essential for the smaller Aegean islands; · it has been specified that the specific supply arrangements should be designed in accordance with local agricultural production, the development of which should not be limited by aid for supply which is too excessive for products which are also produced locally; · in the interests of sound budgetary management, Greece must indicate in its programme the list of aid constituting direct payments; · it is also helpful to indicate how the aid amounts for measures to assist local agricultural products are defined, which was previously not indicated in the basic act; · the ceiling for financing for the specific supply arrangements has increased by 20%, in the light of the information provided by the Court of Auditors concerning the insufficiency of these funds; · the date for presenting the annual report on the implementation of the measures under the support programme during the previous year was postponed for a month in order to provide the Greek authorities with the opportunity of taking account in the report of the final statement of expenditure for the measures to assist local agricultural production. The Regulation does not affect the sources of financing or the intensity of Community support. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: although the proposed amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 do not modify the maximum annual amount, the maximum amount of the special supply arrangements changes to EUR 6.56 million, which will lead to a different resource allocation. This, in turn, could have an impact on the rate of expenditure. However, this possible impact is not measurable at this stage."

BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. These programmes have led to real progress in promoting values and implementing the rights that EU legislation grant to people across the Union. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU’s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the justice programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the rights and values programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The programme has the general objective of contributing to the further development of a European area of justice based on the rule of law, on mutual recognition and mutual trust between justice professionals in cross-border proceedings. The programme has three specific objectives: to facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law including by supporting the efforts to improve the effectiveness of national justice systems and the enforcement of decision; to support and promote judicial training, with a view to fostering a common legal, judicial and rule of law culture; to facilitate effective access to justice for all and effective redress, including by electronic means, by promoting efficient civil and criminal procedures and by promoting and supporting the rights of victims of crime as well as the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings. In concrete terms, the programme seeks to enhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of citizens, professionals and stakeholders, through supporting: information and public awareness raising , including support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights, as guaranteed under Union law, and how to enforce them in practice; training and capacity building for legal professionals in order to equip them with the tools to effectively put Union rights and policies into practice; cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through strengthening networks, i.e. Union-wide organisations to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in this area, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe and cross-border cooperation on enforcement, for example establishing missing child alert systems, coordination of operational and cross-border anti-drug cooperation. The Commission shall ensure the European added value of all actions and activities carried out under the programme, their complementarity with Member States' activities and their compatibility with other Union activities. It shall set establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. Participation is open to all legal entities legally established in a Member State or in a participating non EU country, with no further restrictions on access to the programme. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 305 million for the period 2021-2027."

BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to making available on the market of lifts and safety components for lifts is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 95/16/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The proposal does not change the scope of Directive 95/16/EC and the essential health and safety requirements. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the lifts and safety components for lifts are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the product bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 95/16/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 95/16/EC on the placing on the market of lifts and safety components for lifts has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their products comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant product is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 on the common rules for imports. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. This Regulation applies to imports of products originating in third countries, except for: (a) textile products subject to specific import rules under Regulation (EC) No 517/94; (b) the products originating in certain third countries listed in Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009. The main elements of the proposed Regulation concern: Union information and consultation procedure : the Commission should be informed by the Member States of any danger created by trends in imports which might call for Union surveillance or the application of safeguard measures. In such instances the Commission should examine the terms and conditions under which imports occur, the trend in imports, the various aspects of the economic and trade situations and, where appropriate, the measures to be applied. Union investigation procedure : an investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure, subject to the reservation that the Commission be allowed in urgent cases to apply provisional measures. The proposal lays down detailed provisions on the opening of investigations, the checks and inspections required, access by exporter countries and interested parties to the information gathered, hearings for the parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views. It also establishes time limits for the initiation of investigations and for determinations as to whether or not measures are appropriate, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. Surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in a third country covered by this Regulation threatens to cause injury to Union producers, and where the interests of the Union so require, import of that product may be subject, as appropriate, to retrospective Union surveillance. The decision to impose surveillance shall be taken by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Safeguard measures : it falls on the Commission to adopt the safeguard measures required by the interests of the Union. Those interests should be considered as a whole and should in particular encompass the interests of Union producers, users and consumers. Safeguard measures against a member of the WTO may be considered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such greatly increased quantities and on such terms or conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products. These measures shall take effect immediately. The proposal determines the maximum duration of safeguard measures and specific provisions regarding extension, progressive liberalisation and reviews of such measures. The implementation of this Regulation requires uniform conditions for adopting provisional and definitive safeguard measures, and for the imposition of prior surveillance measures. Those measures should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the recent economic and financial crisis, which hit all Member States and regions in the Union, has forced the EU to face complex problems, such as: high unemployment rates, especially among the low-skilled, the young, older workers, migrants and people with disabilities; an increasingly fragmented labour market, in which more flexible work patterns and other challenges are emerging and which have an impact on job security and working conditions; a shrinking workforce and increasing pressure on social protection systems as a result of demographic change; difficulty in combining work and caring responsibilities and achieving a sustainable work-life balance, hampering personal and family development; an unacceptably high number of people living below the poverty line and in social exclusion. The crisis also highlighted the close links and spill-over between EU-27 economies, especially in the euro area. Coordinated action at the Union level is more effective in addressing these challenges than individual actions of single Member States. To be cost-effective, reforms also need to be as far as possible based on evidence. The involvement of policy-makers and other stakeholders in a collective learning process and in developing and testing new approaches is likely to lead to greater acceptance and ownership of, and commitment to the Europe 2020 strategy. In this context, social innovation, and in particular social experimentation, can be a powerful tool for shaping the reforms and policy adjustments needed to implement Europe 2020. While tackling socio-economic problems is primarily the responsibility of the Member States and regions and decisions have to be taken closest to the citizen, the Union has a role to play in putting the need for specific reforms on the agenda, identifying barriers to change and ways of overcoming them, ensuring that existing Union level rules are complied with, stimulating sharing of good practice and mutual learning, and supporting social innovation and Europe-wide approaches. The European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation is based on three existing instruments: (i) the Progress Programme ; (ii) EURES (European employment services; (iii) the European Progress Microfinance Facility for employment and social inclusion . IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considered three options: Option 1: no policy change : under this option, the Progress programme, EURES and the Progress micro-finance facility, would continue to exist as separate instruments running alongside the European Social Fund. Option 2: a new integrated programme for social change and innovation : the new programme is made up of three separate albeit complementary axes: Progress, EURES and microfinance and social entrepreneurship. Option 3: a single instrument for employment and social affairs : such an instrument would have a shared management strand (the European Social Fund) and a direct management strand. The impact assessment has concluded that option 2 is the preferred option that would bring about the most benefits in terms of efficiency gains, critical mass, coherence and effectiveness, while avoiding political and institutional risks. LEGAL BASIS: Article 46(d), Article 149, Article 153(2)(a) and the third paragraph of Article 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a new agenda for social change and social innovation. The proposal contains a set of common provisions applicable to each part of the Programme and the special provisions applicable to each instrument. (1) Common provisions : Subject matter : the proposed Regulation establishes a European Union Programme for Social Change and Innovation which aims to contribute to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy, its headline targets and Integrated Guidelines by providing financial support for the European Union’s objectives in terms of promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social protection, combating social exclusion and poverty and improving working conditions. The Programme shall run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Structure of the Programme :the Programme shall be made up of the following three complementarity axes: The Progress axis, which shall support the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Union employment and social policy and legislation on working conditions and shall promote evidence-based policy-making and innovation, in partnership with the social partners, civil society organisations and other interested parties; The EURES axis, which shall support activities carried out by the EURES network, i.e. the specialist services designated by the EEA Member States and the Swiss Confederation, together with other interested parties, to develop information exchanges and dissemination and other forms of cooperation to promote workers’ geographical mobility; The Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis, which shall facilitate access to finance for entrepreneurs, especially those furthest from the labour market, and social enterprises. General objectives of the Programme : these include: strengthening ownership of the Union objectives in the employment, social and working conditions fields among key Union and national policy-makers, as well as other interested parties in order to bring about concrete and coordinated actions at both Union and Member State level; supporting the development of adequate, accessible and efficient social protection systems and labour markets and facilitate policy reform, by promoting good governance, mutual learning and social innovation; modernise Union law in line with the Smart Regulation principles and ensure that Union law on matters relating to working conditions is effectively applied; promote workers’ geographical mobility and boost employment opportunities by developing Union labour markets that are open and accessible to all; promote employment and social inclusion by increasing the availability and accessibility of microfinance for vulnerable groups and micro-enterprises, and by increasing access to finance for social enterprises. Types of actions : the following types of actions may be financed under the Programme: Progress : (i) gathering of data and statistics, as well as development of common methodologies, classifications, indicators and benchmarks; (ii) evaluations and impact assessments; (iii) preparation and implementation of social experimentation as a method for testing and evaluating innovative solutions with a view to scaling them up; dissemination of the results of these analytical activities. Mutual learning, awareness and dissemination activities including, inter alia, (i) Council Presidency events, conferences and seminars; (ii) training of legal and policy practitioners, and EURES advisers; (iii) drafting and publication of guides, reports and educational material; etc. Support for main actors in regard to: the operating costs of key Union-level networks whose activities relate and contribute to the objectives of the Progress axis; networking and cooperation among specialist bodies, national, regional and local authorities, and employment services at European level; funding of European-level observatories. EURES : actions to promote mobility of individuals in the Union, in particular the development of a multilingual digital platform for the clearance of job vacancies and applications, and targeted mobility schemes to fill vacancies where labour market shortcomings have been identified and/or to help specific groups of workers such as young people. Microfinance : support to microfinance and social enterprises in particular through the financial instruments (grants). ( Evaluation and follow-up : with a view to regular monitoring of the Programme and making any adjustments needed to its policy and funding priorities, the Commission shall draw up biennial monitoring reports and send them to the European Parliament and the Council. A mid-term evaluation of the Programme shall be carried out by the end of 2017 to measure progress made in meeting its objectives, to determine whether its resources have been used efficiently and to assess its Union added value. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the financial appropriations for implementing the Programme for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 will amount to EUR 958.19 million (in current prices): 60% to the Progress axis, of which at least 17% shall be allocated to promoting social experimentation as a method for testing and evaluating innovative solutions with a view to scaling them up;"

2092EP7,"""""European Year for Active Ageing (2012)""""",0.702,0.832,0.737,0.258,0.333,0.831,0.821,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish the European Year for Active Ageing (2012). PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union is in a process of significant population ageing. According to Eurostat's latest projections released in 2008, there would be only two people of working age (15-64) for every person aged over 65 in the EU by 2060 compared to a ratio of four to one today. The strongest push in this direction is expected to occur during the period 2015-35 when the baby boom cohorts will be in retirement. This shift is due to a combination of low birth rates and rising life expectancy. These demographic changes present both challenges and opportunities. Population ageing may increase pressure on public budgets and pension systems, as well as on the staffing of social and care services for older people. There is a fear that the older generations might become too heavy a burden on younger, working-age people and that this could result in tensions between generations. This view neglects, however, the significant actual and potential contribution that older people — and the baby-boom cohorts in particular — can make to society. A key opportunity for tackling the challenge of demographic ageing and preserving intergenerational solidarity consists therefore in ensuring that the baby-boom cohorts stay longer in the labour market and remain healthy, active and autonomous as long as possible. In the framework of the Employment Strategy, Member States have started to reverse the trend to early retirement so that the EU-27 employment rate for people aged 55-64 has increased from 36.9% in 2000 to 46% in 2009. Encouraging older workers to stay in employment requires notably the improvement of working conditions and their adaptation to the health status and needs of older workers, updating their skills by providing better access to life long learning and the review of tax and benefit systems to ensure that there are effective incentives for working longer. Active ageing is also an effective tool for tackling poverty in old age. In 2008, 19% of people aged 65+ in the EU were at risk of poverty. A considerable number of older people experience old age as a time of marginalisation. While better employment opportunities for older people could help tackle some of the causes of poverty among this age group, active participation in voluntary activities could reduce the isolation of older people. The huge potential that older persons represent for society as volunteers or carers could be better mobilised by eliminating existing obstacles to unpaid work and by providing the right framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: current activities at EU level do not seem properly geared to dealing with what needs to be done: raise awareness among the general public, policy makers and other stakeholders of the importance of active ageing and of the need to do more to mobilise the potential of the baby boom cohorts; foster an exchange of information and experience between Member States and stakeholders; give Member States and stakeholders an opportunity to develop policies by way of specific activities and by committing to specific objectives. The Commission considers that broad-based support will be required at all levels of society and from a wide range of stakeholders. The key challenge is to mobilise stakeholders in a way that will generate significant action at national, regional, local and company levels across the EU. With greater political momentum and visibility for active ageing policies, policy makers can be encouraged to take more ambitious initiatives. It is for this reason that implementation of the European Year for Active Ageing could be useful. LEGAL BASE: Article 153(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the year 2012 shall be designated as the European Year for Active Ageing. Objectives : the overall purpose of the European Year shall be to encourage and support the efforts of Member States, their regional and local authorities, social partners and civil society to promote active ageing and to do more to mobilise the potential of the rapidly growing population in their late 50s and above, thereby preserving solidarity between generations. Active ageing means creating better opportunities and working conditions to enable older workers to play their part in the labour market, combating social exclusion by fostering active participation in society, and encouraging healthy ageing. On this basis, the objectives shall be: to raise general awareness of the value of active ageing in order to highlight the useful contribution older persons make to society and the economy, to promote active ageing and to do more to mobilise the potential of older persons; to stimulate debate and develop mutual learning between Member States and stakeholders at all levels in order to promote active ageing policies, to identify and disseminate good practice and to encourage cooperation and synergies; to offer a framework for commitment and concrete action to enable Member States and stakeholders at all levels to develop policies through specific activities and to commit to specific objectives related to active ageing. Activities :the measures to be taken to achieve the objectives the following activities at Union, national, regional or local level: conferences, events and initiatives to promote debate, raise awareness and foster the making of specific commitments; information, promotion and educational campaigns; exchange of information, experience and good practices; research and surveys on a Union or national scale, and dissemination of the results. The Year should be seen as the highlight of a major effort spanning the period 2011-2014, during which the EU would focus many of its programmes and policies on the issue of active ageing and put in place a framework in which new initiatives and partnerships supporting active ageing at all levels (Member State, regional, local, social partners, civil society) can be encouraged and publicised. In 2011, public authorities, social partners and civil society organisations at all levels would be encouraged to commit themselves to specific goals related to active ageing; the focus would be on achievements during the European Year. The goals would be documented on a European website which would then become the website for the European Year and would also serve as a tool for monitoring and evaluation. In 2012, the focus of the European Year would be on starting to implement the commitments made during 2011, on raising awareness among the general public, publicising these initiatives through media activities and the involvement of other multipliers. Results of active ageing projects funded under existing budget lines and programmes would be presented. The primary intention is to promote active ageing in employment by creating better opportunities for the participation of older workers, and to promote active ageing in society, by combating social exclusion through voluntary work, healthy ageing and autonomous living. Coordination at Union level : the Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators for the purpose of coordination at Union level and to exchange information, including on commitments made and their implementation in the Member States. The European Parliament, the Member States, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions will be associated in the activities. Evaluation : by 30 June 2014, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in this Decision. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: no additional funding is sought for the European Year. The flexibility for annual or multiannual priority-setting based on the budget lines and programmes of the Directorate General for Employment and other relevant programmes provides sufficient financial margin for running the Year on a scale similar to previous European Years. The administrative resources can also come from existing administrative budgets."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Russia’s recent military aggression against Ukraine and the ongoing armed conflict has fundamentally changed the security situation in Europe. As a result of the aggression, the European Union, and its eastern regions in particular, is facing a substantial inflow of persons. Secondly, the COVID-19 pandemic has lasted longer than could have been expected in 2020. The direct and indirect effects of the pandemic persist in all Member States, requiring prolonged public support for recovery in the most affected territories and economic sectors. This has put considerable pressure on Member States' budgets. While the flexibility and additional resources provided for the period 2014-2020 have helped Member States in their crisis response and recovery efforts, the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus, notably the Omicron variant, as well as the general tightening of restrictions in the last quarter of 2021, have continued to have serious negative effects on Member States’ economies and societies and hampered a normal implementation of cohesion policy programmes and of programmes supported by the FEAD. The recent military aggression by Russia and the resulting migration flows have exacerbated these effects and risk further undermining economic recovery. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. CONTENT: the proposal aims to: - facilitate the use of cohesion policy and FEAD resources by Member States and regions to support measures to address migratory challenges as a result of the military aggression by Russia; and - allow for a derogation from the normal co-financing rules currently applicable in order to allow for the necessary flexibility to mobilise existing investment resources to address the direct and indirect effects stemming from the unprecedented public health crisis in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 in order to: - ensure that Member States and regions may continue to benefit from a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2021-2022 and this by way of notification to the Commission; - introduce arrangements for the budgetary execution of additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate to take account of annual ceilings for payments; - introduce additional flexibility between ERDF and ESF specifically for operations addressing the migratory challenges as a result of the military aggression by Russia and introduce simplified reporting arrangements on participants with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 February 2022 (date of the start of the military aggression); - introduce flexibility for Member States to amend programmes supported by the FEAD and this by way of notification to the Commission and also with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 February 2022. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not require changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments and does not imply changes to the overall payment needs over the 2021-2027 period. Based on the previous uptake of the 100% co-financing rate in the 2020-2021 accounting year, the level of payment applications submitted in the second half of 2021, and the latest Member State payment forecasts for 2022, the budgetary impact of the application of the 100% co-financing rate for the 2021-2022 accounting year is estimated to represent a frontloading of payment needs of EUR 9 billion to 2022 and EUR 1 billion to 2023, compensated by a corresponding reduction of EUR 10 billion in 2024. However, in order to be able to comply with the payment ceilings in years 2022 and 2023, it is proposed to cap the total additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate at EUR 5 billion in 2022 and EUR 1 billion in 2023. The additional amounts will only be paid after all the payment applications are received for the accounting year 2021-2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 allows Member States to adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use of authorised GMOs and GM food and feed only if they are able to demonstrate that the product in question is likely to pose risks to health and to the environment. The Regulation requires the Commission as risk manager to take a decision on an application for authorisation in a reasonable period of time (to grant an authorisation or refuse an authorisation). Since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, there has never been a qualified majority amongst Member States in favour of or against a draft Commission Decision authorising Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and Genetically Modified (GM) food and feed. The result has always been a “no opinion” for all stages of the procedure. As a result, the authorisation decisions have been adopted by the Commission, in accordance with applicable legislation, without the support of the Member States’ committee opinion. Regarding cultivation of GMOs , Directive (EU) 2015/412 grants Member States more flexibility to decide whether or not they wish to cultivate GMOs on their territory without affecting the risk assessment provided in the system of Union authorisations of GMOs. However, that Directive does not cover GMOs and GM food and feed authorised under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. In its Communication on the reviewing the decision-making process on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the Communication concluded that the current legal framework should be amended, by extending the approach agreed in Directive (EU) 2015/412 to other products covered by the Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. CONTENT: the Commission proposal amends Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 to introduce new provisions allowing Member States to restrict or prohibit the use of GMOs and GM food and feed covered by the GMO legal framework, in part or all of their territory, in complement to the possibilities already offered to Member States with respect to GMOs for cultivation by Directive (EU) 2015/412. The proposal does not affect the Union procedure of authorisation based on risks which should remain harmonised at Union level in order to maintain a same level of safety throughout the EU. According to the proposed Regulation, Member States may adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use GMOs or GM food and feed products provided that such measures are: reasoned and based on compelling grounds in accordance with Union law which shall, in no case, conflict with the risk assessment carried out pursuant this Regulation; proportional and non-discriminatory . Where a Member State intends to adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use of products, it shall first submit to the Commission a draft of those measures, and the corresponding justification. The Commission shall immediately notify to the other Member States the draft measures and the corresponding justification. During a period of 3 months from the date of submission to the Commission of the draft measures and various information: the Member State shall refrain from adopting and implementing those measures; the Commission and the Member States may make any comments they consider appropriate to the Member State which has submitted the draft measures. The proposal does not allow Member States to restrict or prohibit the use of products which do not have to be labelled under the GMO legal framework, even if they may contain a small proportion of GMOs or GM food and feed below the thresholds set out therein. Provisions are also established to protect the rights of economic operators which lawfully placed on the market a GMO or a GM food and feed before the Member State adopt measures pursuant to the proposal. Sufficient time should be given to operators to allow the phasing out of the product from the market."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the planning, development and operation of trans-European transport networks contribute to the attainment of major Union objectives, such as the smooth functioning of the internal market and the strengthening of economic and social cohesion and also have the specific objectives of allowing the seamless and sustainable mobility of persons and goods and ensuring accessibility for all regions of the Union. These specific objectives should be achieved by establishing interconnections and interoperability between national transport networks in a resource-efficient way. Growth in traffic has resulted in increased congestion on international transport corridors. In order to ensure the international mobility of goods and passengers, the capacity of the trans-European transport network and the use of this capacity should be optimised and, if necessary, expanded by removing infrastructure bottlenecks and bridging missing infrastructure links within and between Member States. Five main problems need to be tackled at EU level: (1) missing links, in particular at cross-border sections, are a major obstacle to the free movement of goods and passengers within and between the Member States and with its neighbours; (2) a considerable and enduring disparity in quality and availability of infrastructure between and within the Member States (bottlenecks); (3) transport infrastructure between the transport modes is fragmented; (4) investments in transport infrastructures should contribute to achieve the goals of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in transport by 60% by 2050; (5) Member States still maintain different operational rules and requirements, in particular in the field of interoperability, which add to the transport infrastructure barriers and bottlenecks. These new guidelines, which will replace Decision 661/2010/EU, seek to establish a complete and integrated trans-European transport network , covering all Member States and regions and providing the basis for the balanced development of all transport modes in order to facilitate their respective advantages, thereby maximising the value added for Europe of the network. In the light of the challenges for the TEN-T policy, also identified by the White Paper “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system”, these Guidelines will define a long-term strategy for the TEN-T policy up to 2030/2050. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t he Impact Assessment identifies four specific objectives for addressing the problem of a fragmented network. This involves, on the one hand, enhanced coordination in EU planning and the designing of a sound governance structure to secure implementation of an optimal network configuration. Two policy options were the result: option 1 , combining a planning approach largely based on the current policy, though with certain amendments in the light of the experience gained, with a reinforced coordination approach to implementation; option 2 , combining a stronger approach to planning coordination, through identification of an optimised configuration for the strategic ""core"" of the TEN-T, with the same reinforced coordination approach to implementation. The Commission considers that this second option, because of the stronger coordination at both planning and implementation levels, would have an overall higher impact. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation will repeal and replace Decision 661/2010/EU on Union guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network. This proposal aims to establish and develop a complete TEN-T, consisting of infrastructure for railways, inland waterways, roads, maritime and air transport, thereby ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and strengthening economic and social cohesion. To achieve these objectives, two fields of action are envisaged: - the first field of action is ""conceptual planning"": the gradual implementation of the TEN-T network by means of a dual-layer approach, consisting of a comprehensive network and a core network. The comprehensive network constitutes the basic layer of the TEN-T. It consists of all existing and planned infrastructure meeting the requirements of the Guidelines. The comprehensive network is to be in place by 31 December 2050 at the latest. The core network overlays the comprehensive network and consists of its strategically most important parts. It constitutes the backbone of the multi-modal mobility network. It concentrates on those components of TEN-T with the highest European added value: cross border missing links, key bottlenecks and multi-modal nodes. The core network is to be in place by 31 December 2030 at the latest. - the second field of action concerns the implementation instruments. The Commission has developed the concept of core network corridors, taking due account of the rail freight corridors. These corridors will provide the framework instrument for the coordinated implementation of the core network. In terms of scope, the core network corridors will in principle cover three transport modes and cross at least three Member States. If possible, they should establish a connection with a maritime port. In terms of activities, the core network corridors will provide a platform for capacity management, investments, building and coordinating multi-modal transhipment facilities, and deploying interoperable traffic management systems. The proposal includes the following key aspects: Guidelines : the Guidelines set the framework for identifying projects of common interest. These projects contribute to the development and establishment of TEN-T through the creation, maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading of infrastructure, through measures to promote the resource-efficient use of infrastructure and by enabling sustainable and efficient freight transport services. With a view to cooperation with third and neighbouring countries , the European Union may promote projects of mutual interest. The comprehensive network is specified by: infrastructure requirements; priorities for promoting projects of common interest. freight terminals, passenger stations, inland ports, maritime ports and airports will connect transport modes in order to allow multi-modal transport; urban nodes form key elements in the comprehensive network as connecting points between the different transport infrastructures. Core network : the guidelines lay down specific requirements for the core network, in addition to the requirements for the comprehensive network, for example availability of alternative fuels. The Commission will monitor and evaluate the progress made in implementing the core network; core network corridors are an instrument for implementing the core network. They are to be based on modal integration and interoperability and lead to coordinated development and management; European Coordinators will facilitate the coordinated implementation of the corridors, in cooperation with corridor platforms to be established by Member States concerned; ach corridor platform will establish a multi-annual development plan, including investment and implementation plans, as a management structure. Based on this information the Commission will adopt implementing acts (decisions) for each corridor. Lastly, the proposal calls for regular revision of the annexes by means of delegated acts in order to update the maps of the comprehensive network. It also envisages a review of the core network by 2023. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal will not entail any additional cost for the EU budget. It should be noted that in the context of the Communication on the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020, the Commission has announced the creation of a new instrument at EU level, the ''Connecting Europe Facility"", which will finance EU priority infrastructure in transport, energy and digital broadband. The facility will have a single fund of EUR 50 billion for the period 2014-2020, of which EUR 31.7 billion will be allocated to transport, out of which €10 billion will be ring fenced for related transport infrastructures investments inside the Member States eligible under the Cohesion Fund. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions enabling the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative is part of the Commission's efforts to create an energy union and from a series of proposals on low-emission transport. It is a follow-up to the Communication ""A European strategy for low-emission mobility"". CO2 emissions from road transport in 2014 were still 17% higher than in 1990. The highest share of these emissions originates from passenger cars (over 60%). Under current trends, the emission reduction will not be sufficient to achieve the EU goals set for 2030 and 2050. Moreover, road infrastructure is degrading in many Member States. Road pricing can be a key incentive for cleaner and more efficient transport operations. Progress towards the Commission's objective of applying the ""polluter pays"" and ""user pays"" principles has been slow. There are still inconsistencies in the application of road pricing across the EU. Directive 1999/62/EC provides the legal framework for charging heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) for the use of certain roads. applies to HGVs, all other vehicles are left unaddressed. It is for this reason that the Commission proposed to include buses, passenger cars and vans in the scope of the Directive, thereby ensuring more consistent pricing of infrastructure use across the road transport sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option provides for the variation of charges for light vehicles according to their CO2 and pollutant emissions, as the preferred option, possibly complemented with the requirement of external cost charging on at least part of the network for HDVs and the phasing-out of time-based charging for light vehicles over a sufficiently long period. CONTENT: the proposal aims at addressing the shortcomings of existing legislation (Directive 1999/62/EC), i.e. at a better fulfilment of the legislation's objectives. Scope : it is proposed to extend the scope of the application of the Directive to include light duty vehicles such as minibuses, passenger cars, vans and coaches. Tolls and user charges : provisions on non-discrimination, proportionality of charges and on the collection and payment of tolls and user charges shall not only apply to networks mainly used by international traffic (the trans-European road network and motorways) but to other roads. Given that distance-based pricing (tolls) rather than duration (tags) better reflects actual use, emission levels and pollution, the Commission proposes to phasing out tariff systems based on (2023 for heavy-duty vehicles, 2027 for other categories of vehicles). The possibility of exempting heavy goods vehicles weighing less than 12 tonnes from road charging would be abolished and the scope of any tariff system would be extended to coaches / buses. External cost charging : it is proposed that the maximum weighted average external-cost charges should be replaced by readily applicable reference values updated in light of inflation, the scientific progress made in estimating the external costs of road transport and the evolution of the fleet composition. From 1 January 2021, Member States that levy tolls shall apply an external-cost charge to heavy duty vehicles on at least the part of the network where environmental damage generated by heavy duty vehicles is the most important. Congestion charging : the proposal allows the application of congestion charges on top of the infrastructure charge. Any such congestion charge has to be applied to all vehicle categories in a proportionate and even-handed manner. Revenues from congestion charges should be used to address congestion problems, for example by supporting alternative transport solutions or removing bottlenecks. Moreover, the possibility of applying mark-ups would be extended and would no longer be restricted to mountainous regions alone. Variation of charges : as regards heavy duty vehicles, it is proposed to phase out the variation of charges according to the Euro emission class of the vehicle. Modalities for the variation of tolls and user charges according to the environmental performance of passenger cars, minibuses and vans have been specified. The variation shall be based on emissions of both CO2 and air pollutants, as specified in Annex VII. This provision should incentivise the use of cleaner and more efficient vehicles. Notifications : it is proposed to simplify the prior information of the Commission in respect of intended external cost charging, by confining the information to basic elements. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU put in place a regulatory framework to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 40% as endorsed by the European Council in 2014, before the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The ‘Fit for 55’ package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to National targets and flexibilities The proposal updates the framework under which the Commission will set the new Member States’ annual emission levels in the years 2023–2030 A review will be carried out in 2025 with a view to adjusting the annual emission allocations for the years of 2026 to 2030 in order to ensure that they are neither too lenient nor too stringent. The proposal sets national ESR targets based mainly on GDP per capita, in order to ensure fairness and cost effectiveness in effort distribution, while enabling though its flexibilities a cost-efficient achievement of such targets. Member States can decide to opt-out. This reserve could be triggered only once the requirements of the Climate Law are fulfilled, for the purpose of national compliance with ESR targets by transferring any unused LULUCF credits. They may use a limited a limited amount of credit generated under the LULUCF legislation for compliance in the ESR. The Commission also proposes a new voluntary reserve, the additional reserve, to help Member States reaching their individual targets, allowing them to use non used net removals generated in the period 2026-2030, subject to the condition that the Union 55% emission reduction target is reached in 2030 with a maximum contribution of net removals set at 225 MtCO2Eq, as required by the European Climate Law. Monitoring and reporting The proposal continues the Effort Sharing Regulation with the same monitoring and reporting obligations for Member States and management tasks for the Commission. The Commission will continue to be supported by the European Environment Agency in monitoring Member States’ progress in meeting their obligations under the proposal. Budgetary implications The increase in the ESR targets will require additional measures at national level and Member States will need to revise and implement more stringent climate action strategies. Therefore, there is a need for capacity building support measures to be implemented throughout five years (2023-2027) allowing Member States to adjust to a more demanding framework. The total estimated cost of the support measures is EUR 1 750 000."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the Agreement between the European Union and Chile on trade in organic products was signed, subject to its conclusion. The Agreement aims at fostering trade in organic products, contributing to the development and expansion of the organic sector in the Union and in Chile and achieving a high level of respect for the principles of organic production. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: with this proposed Council Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile on trade in organic products. In addition to fostering trade in organic products, the Agreement envisages the following actions: expansion of the organic sector in the EU and Chile; achieving a high level of respect for the principles of organic production, of guarantee of the control systems and of integrity of organic products; improved protection of the respective organic logos of the Union and Chile; enhanced regulatory cooperation between the Parties on issues related to organic production. Equivalence agreement : The Union and Chile are called upon to recognise the equivalence of their respective rules on organic production and control systems as regards organic products. Accordingly, the Agreement provides that the products listed in the Annexes shall be mutually recognised as equivalent to the production of one party or the other in accordance with the legislation of one or the other parties. Joint committee : the Joint Committee on Organic Products established pursuant to the Agreement, deals with certain aspects of the implementation of the Agreement. In particular, it has the power to amend the lists of products in Annexes I and II to the Agreement. The Commission should be authorised to represent the Union in the Joint Committee. The Commission should be empowered to approve amendments to the lists of products in Annexes I and II to the Agreement, on the condition that it inform the representatives of the Member States. It should also be empowered to unilaterally suspend the recognition of equivalence, on the condition that it inform the representatives of the Member States prior to doing so. In cases where representatives of the Member States representing a blocking minority object to the position presented by the Commission, the Commission should not be allowed to approve amendments to the lists of products in Annexes I and II or to suspend the recognition of equivalence. In such cases, the Commission should present a proposal for a Council decision on the basis of Article 218(9) of the Treaty."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II) provides a modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance undertakings. On 19 January 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal to amend Directive 2009/138/EC (Omnibus II) in order to: take into account the new supervisory architecture for insurance and namely the setting up of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Agency (EIOPA) on 1 January 2011; adapt Directive 2009/138/EC to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty which required the adjustment of empowerments for the Commission to adopt implementing measures to empowerments for the Commission to adopt implementing and delegated acts. The deadline for transposition and application of Directive 2009/138/EC was initially 31 October 2012 and 1 November 2012 respectively, but pending the outcome of the on-going legislative negotiations on Omnibus II, Directive 2012/23/EU (Quick Fix) postponed these dates to 30 June 2013 and 1 January 2014 respectively. In view of the fact that the negotiations on Omnibus II have not yet been finalised, the date of transposition of 30 June 2013, which has already elapsed, should be extended one last time. The aim is to avoid continued legal uncertainty and ensure the legal continuity of the current Solvency provisions (Solvency I) until the complete Solvency II package is in place. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is not accompanied by a separate Impact Assessment as an impact assessment for the Solvency II Directive has already been undertaken. This proposal is necessary to avoid an uncertain legal situation after 1 January 2014. In the absence of this Directive, a gap would exist between the EU legal system (Solvency II) and that of Member States (where Solvency I as transposed would remain in force) leading to legal uncertainty for supervisory authorities, undertakings and Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 53 (1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Directive does not alter the substance of the current EU legislation: it is restricted to postponing the date of transposition of Directive 2009/138/EC until 31 January 2015; in order to avoid continued legal uncertainty now that the current deadline for transposition (30 June 2013) has expired. It also provides for a new, later application date for Solvency II and consequent repeal of Solvency I (1 January 2016). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes requirements in relation to the exercise of certain shareholder rights attaching to voting shares in relation to general meetings of companies which have their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State. The financial crisis has revealed that shareholders in many cases supported managers' excessive short-term risk taking. Moreover, there is clear evidence that institutional investors and their asset managers do not sufficiently focus on the real (long-term) performance of companies, but often on share-price movements and the structure of capital market indexes, which leads to suboptimal return for the end beneficiaries of institutional investors and puts short-term pressure on companies. The past years have highlighted certain corporate governance shortcomings in European listed companies. These shortcomings relate to different actors: companies’ and their boards, shareholders (institutional investors and asset managers) and proxy advisors. Five main issues have been identified : insufficient engagement of institutional investors and asset managers; insufficient link between pay and performance of directors; lack of shareholder oversight on related party transactions; inadequate transparency of proxy advisors; difficult and costly exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors. Stakeholders were consulted on two Green Papers (""Corporate governance in financial institution"" and ""The EU corporate governance framework""). Based on these consultations and further analysis, the Commission's Action Plan: European company law and corporate governance - a modern legal framework for more engaged shareholders and sustainable companies provides the Commission’s roadmap in the area, based the two objectives of enhancing transparency and engaging shareholders. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a range of options, including no policy change, have been considered to address each of the presented problems. The preferred option is the following: 1) mandatory transparency of institutional investors and asset managers on their voting and engagement and certain aspects of asset management arrangements; 2) disclosure of the remuneration policy and individual remunerations, combined with a shareholder vote; 3) additional transparency and an independent opinion on more important related party transactions and submission of the most substantial transactions to shareholder approval; 4) binding disclosure requirements on the methodology and conflicts of interests of proxy advisors; 5) creating a framework to allow listed companies to identify their shareholders and requiring intermediaries to rapidly transmit information related to shareholders and to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights. CONTENT: the main objectives of the proposal are as follows: Improving engagement of institutional investors and asset managers : the proposal should increase the transparency of institutional investors and asset managers. They will be required to develop a policy on shareholder engagement, which should contribute to managing actual or potential conflicts of interests with regard to shareholder engagement. They should in principle disclose to the public their engagement policy, how it has been implemented and the results thereof. Where institutional investors or asset managers decide not to develop an engagement policy and/or decide not to disclose the implementation and results thereof, they shall give a clear and reasoned explanation as to why this is the case. Strengthening the link between pay and performance of directors : the proposal aims at creating more transparency on remuneration policy and the actual remuneration awarded to directors and creating a better link between pay and performance of directors by improving shareholder oversight of directors’ remuneration. Shareholders should have the right to approve the remuneration policy and to vote on the remuneration report. All benefits of directors in whatever form will be included in the remuneration policy and report. The proposal does not regulate the level of remuneration and leaves decisions on this to companies and their shareholders. Improving shareholder oversight on related party transactions : the proposal requires listed companies that related party transactions representing more than 5% of the companies’ assets or transactions which can have a significant impact on profits or turnover to submit these transactions to the approval of shareholders and may not unconditionally conclude it without their approval. For smaller related party transactions that represent more than 1% of their assets, listed companies shall publicly announce such transactions at the time of the conclusion of the transaction, and accompany the announcement by a report from an independent third party. In order to target only transactions that could be most disadvantageous for minority shareholders and to keep administrative burden limited Member States should be allowed to exclude transactions entered into between the company and members of its group that are fully owned by the listed company. Enhancing transparency of proxy advisors : the proposal will require proxy advisors to adopt and implement adequate measures to guarantee that their voting recommendations are accurate and reliable, based on a thorough analysis of all the information that is available to them and are not affected by any existing or potential conflict of interest or business relationship. Proxy advisors are required to publicly disclose certain key information related to the preparation of their voting recommendations. Facilitating the exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors : it is estimated that non-national shareholders hold some 44% of the shares in EU listed companies. The proposal requires Member States to ensure that intermediaries offer to listed companies the possibility to have their shareholders identified. Intermediaries should, on the request of such a company communicate without undue delay the name and contact details of the shareholders. The proposal also requires that intermediaries facilitate the exercise of the rights by the shareholder, including the right to participate and vote in general meetings and requires companies to confirm the votes cast in general meetings by or on behalf of shareholders."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 43 of the TFEU. CONTENT: this proposal aims to identify the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 and establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts. Pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty , the proposal allows the Commission to adopt delegated acts in order to: adopt exceptions to the rule that no rural development support should be granted to schemes eligible for support under common market organisations; adopt detailed conditions concerning all the measures and technical assistance in order to ensure their coherent application in line with the requirements of EU policy, priorities and law; make detailed rules for reductions and exclusions; define a flexibility threshold for each axis; define detailed rules for forms of support other than non-repayable direct assistance; The Commission shall fix detailed control rules and adopt specific transitional measures. In accordance with Article 291 of the Treaty Member States are responsible for implementing the regime established by the Legislator. However, it seems necessary to ensure uniform implementation of the scheme in Member States in order to avoid distortions of competition or discrimination between operators. Therefore, the Legislator gives the Commission powers of enforcement as regards: the uniform conditions for the presentation of rural development programmes; programme approval; approval of revision of programmes; determination of changes requiring approval by Commission decision; longer commitment periods; specific provisions on designation of areas; the establishment and operation of the national rural network; presentation of specific annual reports; a general framework of controls and a common monitoring and evaluation framework that Member states Shall implement. Additionally, some elements of simplification are introduced: Reduction of the number of summary reports and simplification of their content under strategic monitoring: a s part of the simplification exercise of the CAP Member States wanted a reduction in the number of reports to the Commission. In addition to annual progress reports, Member States are required to submit to the Commission summary reports setting out the progress made in implementing their national strategy plans and objectives and their contribution to the achievement of the Community strategic guidelines. Under the current rules, these summary reports are to be submitted each second year, starting from 2010 and ending in 2014, i.e. altogether three reports. The proposal will limit the number of reports to two, the first one to be submitted in 2010 and the second one in 2015, the former in the context of mid-term evaluation and the latter of ex post evaluation. In addition, the report is required to summarise the previous year's annual progress reports. This requirement should be dropped, as it duplicates work. The number of Commission reports summarising the main developments, trends and challenges relating to the implementation of the national strategy plans and the Community strategic guidelines will bw reduced to two, one in 2011 and the second one in 2016. Extension of the coverage of the measure for producer groups: the current provision on support for producer groups, which is already available for all sectors in the new Member States, should be extended to also cover EU-15. However, there will be support for producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector as their activities may be supported under the single CMO. Facilitating more tailor-made use of the advisory services: Mem ber States had proposed changing the rules for use of advisory services. Currently the rules require that, as a minimum, the advisory service to farmers should cover the statutory management requirements and the good agricultural and environmental conditions under cross-compliance as well as the occupational safety standards based on Union legislation. In order to facilitate more tailor-made use of the advisory services and to reflect the individual needs of the beneficiary, the advisory service provided will not need to cover all the aspects listed, but one or more of them. Continuous linear features and stepping stones: a ccording to Article 10 of the Habitats Directive, Member States shall endeavour, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora. Such features are those which, by virtue of their linear and continuous structure (such as rivers with their banks or the traditional systems for marking field boundaries) or their function as stepping stones (such as ponds or small woods), are essential for the migration, dispersal and genetic exchange of wild species. These areas can play an important role for the coherence of Natura 2000 areas and relevant provisions should be included in order to allow Natura 2000 payments for these nationally delimited nature protection areas if sufficient justification is provided linking them to Article 10 of the Habitats Directive. In order to ensure that payments continue to be primarily used for the designated Natura 2000 sites, it is proposed to limit their proportion compared to the Natura 2000 areas. However, this provision is without prejudice to the endeavours of Member States under the Habitats Directive related to encouraging the management of landscape features which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora and does not prejudice the question of what constitutes an adequate implementation of Article 10 of the Habitats Directive. Follow up of non-compliances of the cross-compliance: Member State can decide to consider a case of non-compliance as minor or not to apply a reduction or exclusion where the amount concerned is less than EUR 100. Currently, the competent control authority should ensure that the farmer remedies the findings of the non-compliance concerned. However, with a view to simplification and in order to ease the administrative burden, consideration should be given to simplifying the follow-up checks system. Introducing incentive element for measures falling under Article 43 of the Treaty: i n order to be compatible with the common market, any aid measure must contain some incentive element or require some counterpart on the part of the beneficiary. Aid which is granted retroactively in respect of activities which have already been undertaken by the beneficiary cannot be considered to contain the necessary incentive element. However, for co-financed Rural Development measures approved under Article 43 of the Treaty, there is currently no requirement for an incentive effect laid down in the Union legislation, except in the case of top-ups to which agricultural state aid rules apply. Therefore, retroactive granting of aid should also be prohibited for co-financed agricultural measures and a starting date of eligibility should be provided. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the negative economic consequences of the current COVID-19 outbreak could endanger the financial health of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers and have serious negative effects on the transport system and the economy as a whole. Unusually, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union and Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety, Member States had a choice of two transposition deadlines – 16 June 2019, or, upon notification to the Commission and the European Union Agency for Railways, 16 June 2020. Only eight Member States have transposed both Directives in 2019 (BG, FI, FR, GR, IT, NL, RO, SI). In the light of COVID-19 outbreak, most of the remaining 17 Member States have requested a delay to transposition, claiming they will be unable to complete the necessary legislation before 16 June 2020. Since the COVID-19 outbreak struck in the final stage of adoption of the national transposition measures, it is proposed that Member States should be allowed an additional period of three months to complete the transposition process. Given the extraordinary circumstances, it is entirely understandable that final transposition may be impossible before 16 June 2020. CONTENT: therefore, the Commission proposes that Member States should be able to complete the process in an additional period of three months (16 September 2020). A number of implementing acts and delegated acts have been adopted in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798. Given the dual transposition deadline, according transitional provisions and dates for entry into force have been introduced therein. The Commission shall propose a set of amendments to the implementing acts to align them with the extension of the transposition deadlines following the adoption of the proposed Directive. For the relevant delegated acts, the existing procedure set out in Directive (EU) 2016/798 would not allow an alignment with the extension of the transposition deadlines on time. Thus, a legal basis and simplified procedure for the further alignment is provided in the proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between Mauritania and the European Community entered into force on 8 August 2008 for a period of six years. The agreement is renewable by tacit agreement and is therefore still in force. A previous four-year protocol for the implementation of the FPA (2015-2019) was extended twice, each time for a period of one year. It expires on 15 November 2021. In 2018, the Commission carried out an ex-post evaluation of the 2015-2019 FPA Protocol, as well as an ex-ante evaluation of a possible renewal of the FPA Protocol. The evaluation concluded that the EU fishing sector has a strong interest in operating in Gabon and that a renewal of the protocol would be in the interest of both parties. In addition, the renewal of the protocol would contribute to strengthening monitoring, control and surveillance, as well as improving the governance of fisheries activities in the region. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Mauritania with a view to concluding, on behalf of the European Union, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Implementing Protocol. Following these negotiations, an agreement and a protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 28 July 2021. The new Agreement covers a period of six years from the date of provisional application, that being the date on which it is signed by both parties. The new Implementing Protocol covers a period of five years from the date of provisional application and contains a clause providing for a review during its second year of application. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to authorise the conclusion of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania and the Protocol implementing that Agreement. Objectives The conclusion of the Agreement and its implementing Protocol will make it possible to continue and strengthen the strategic partnership in the fisheries sector between the European Union and Mauritania. The Agreement and the Protocol will also contribute to: - better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial (sectoral) support for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the fisheries comprehensive plan, the monitoring and combating of illegal fishing and support for the small-scale fisheries sector; - the sustainable exploitation by Mauritania of its marine resources, as well as Mauritania's fisheries economy, by promoting the growth of fisheries-related economic activities and the establishment of decent working conditions. Fishing opportunities The new Protocol provides for the same fishing opportunities as the current Protocol during the first 2 years of application, except for a marginal adjustment of the reference tonnage for the two types of tuna vessel. Specifically, it covers the following categories: - vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 15 vessels; - black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 4 vessels; - pelagic freezer trawlers targeting black hake: 3 500 tonnes of hake, 1 450 tonnes of squid, 600 tonnes of cuttlefish for 6 vessels; - vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - tuna seiners: 14 000 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 29 vessels; - pole-and-line tuna vessels and tuna longliners: 7 000 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels; - pelagic freezer trawlers: 247 500 tonnes and 19 vessels; - non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from the volume under category 6, if used) and 2 vessels. Financial contribution For the first 2 years of application of the Protocol, the annual financial contribution for access to Mauritanian waters and fishery resources in those waters is a maximum of EUR 57 500 000. This amount will be reviewed before the third year of application of the Protocol. The financial contribution to support the development of Mauritania’s sectoral fisheries policy is maintained at the overall level of the current Protocol, i.e. EUR 16 500 000 for the entire duration of the Protocol, but is spread over a period of 5 years, taking into account the rate of uptake of the funds and amounts that remain available under the current Protocol."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the context of the ongoing economic and financial crisis, the smooth implementation of the European Fisheries Fund programmes is of particular importance for investment in the fisheries sector. This is particularly the case for those Member States which have been most affected by the crisis and have received financial assistance under an adjustment programme. In order to facilitate the management of Union funding, to help accelerate investments and to improve the availability of funding to the economy, Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 was amended in 2012 to allow the increase of interim and final payments from the European Fisheries Fund by an amount corresponding to ten percentage points above the actual co-financing rate for each priority axis for Member States which are facing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and request to benefit from that measure. Article 77a of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 allows for the application of that increased co-financing rate up to 31 December 2013. However, since Member States still face serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, the application of the increased co-financing rate should not be limited to the end of 2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal would allow the Commission to top up payments to programme countries until the end of the 2007-2013 period. The increase will be an amount calculated by applying ten percentage points top-up to the co-financing rates applicable to the priority axes of the programmes to the newly certified expenditure submitted during the period in question until the ceiling for payments is reached. The total financial allocation for the period from the Fund to the countries and the programmes in question will not change. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed to modify article 77a of the Regulation to allow the Commission to continue, until the end of the eligibility period of the 2007-2013 operational programmes, to reimburse the newly declared expenditure by an increased amount calculated by applying a 10 percentage points top-up of the applicable co-financing rates for the priority axis. The contribution from the fund to the priority axis concerned cannot be higher than the amount mentioned in the Commission decision approving the operational programme. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: There is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of the Fund financing provided for in the operational programmes for the 2007-2013 programming period. For payment appropriations, the proposal relating to the top-up is budget neutral."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: rapid technological developments continue to transform the way works and other subject-matter are created, produced, distributed and exploited. New business models and new actors continue to emerge. The objectives and the principles laid down by the Union copyright framework remain sound. However, legal uncertainty remains, for both rightholders and users, as regards certain uses, including cross-border uses, of works and other subject matter in the digital environment. As set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards a modern, more European copyright framework’, in some areas it is necessary to adapt and supplement the current Union copyright framework to ensure that the internal market does not fragment. In this context, the Commission has identified three areas of intervention with the aim of modernising the exceptions and limitations on copyright: (i) digital and cross-border uses in the field of education, (ii) text and data mining in the field of scientific research, and (iii) preservation of cultural heritage. The objective is to guarantee the legality of certain types of uses in these fields, including across borders. Evolution of digital technologies has reinforced the role of the Internet as the main marketplace for the distribution and access to copyright-protected content. In this new framework, rightholders face difficulties when seeking to license their rights and be remunerated for the online distribution of their works. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide for measures aiming at improving the position of rightholders to negotiate and be remunerated for the exploitation of their content by online services giving access to user-uploaded content. A fair sharing of value is also necessary to ensure the sustainability of the press publications sector. This proposal is presented in parallel with : a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes; a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examines the baseline scenarios, policy options and their impacts for eight topics regrouped under three chapters, namely (i) ensuring wider access to content, (ii) adapting exceptions to digital and cross-border environment and (iii) achieving a well-functioning marketplace for copyright. The assessment concluded that, bearing in mind the predominance of SMEs in the creative sectors, the introduction of a special regime would not be appropriate, as it would defeat the purpose of the intervention. CONTENT: complementing Directive 2010/13/EU and the proposal amending it, this draft directive lays down rules which aim at further harmonising the Union law applicable to copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, taking into account in particular digital and cross-border uses of protected content. It also lays down rules on exceptions and limitations, on the facilitation of licences as well as rules aiming at ensuring a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject matter. Measures to adapt exceptions and limitations to the digital and cross-border environment : Member States are obliged to provide for mandatory exceptions or a limitation allowing: text and data mining carried out by research organisations for the purposes of scientific research; digital uses of works and other subject-matter for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching, enabling teachers and students will be able to take full advantage of digital technologies; and cultural heritage institutions ((i.e. publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives or film or audio heritage institutions) to make copies of works and other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections to the extent necessary for their preservation. Measures to improve licensing practices and ensure wider access to content: the proposal requires Member States to: put in place a legal mechanism to facilitate licensing agreements of out-of-commerce works and other subject-matter; the cross-border effects will be ensured; put in place a stakeholder dialogue on issues relating to foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms and ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders; put in place a negotiation mechanism to facilitate negotiations on the online exploitation of audiovisual works. Measures to achieve a well-functioning marketplace for copyright : the proposal provides for: a new right for press publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recoupment of their investment and the enforcement of their rights; the rights granted to the publishers of press publications under this Directive should have the same scope as the rights of reproduction and making available to the public provided for in Directive 2001/29/EC, insofar as digital uses are concerned; the possibility for all publishers to receive a share in the compensation for uses of works under an exception; measures to improve transparency and better balanced contractual relationships between authors and performers and those to whom they assign their rights; the obligation for Member States to implement negotiation and dispute resolution mechanisms."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: high quality, comparable, up-to-date, reliable and harmonised information on natural gas and electricity prices charged to final customers are needed in order to draft Energy Union policy and monitor the Member States’ energy markets. Up to the present date, Directive 2008/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has provided a common framework for producing, transmitting and disseminating comparable statistics on the natural gas and electricity retail prices charged to industrial customers in the Union. National authorities collect price data for household customers on the basis of a voluntary agreement. The growing complexity of the internal energy market make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable and up-to-date price data for natural gas and electricity in the absence of legally binding obligations to provide such data, in particular for the household sector. In order to guarantee the reporting of high quality price data for the household sector and for the non-household sector, the Commission considered that the collection of both types of data should be covered by a legal act. The European Commission adopted on 25 February 2015 the Energy Union Package. One of the actions of the Energy Union Package under the chapter of the internal energy market defines an analysis of energy prices and costs to be carried out in 2016 and every 2 years thereafter. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to establish a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of comparable European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices for household and final non-household customers in the EU. It repeals Directive 2008/92/EC. While applying the principle of maintaining a reduced burden on respondents and of administrative simplification, Member States shall compile data on natural gas and electricity prices and their sub-components on network costs and taxes, levies, fees and charges as referred to in Annexes I and II and on consumption volumes. The system of consumption bands used by the Commission (Eurostat) in its price publications should ensure the transparency of the market and the broad dissemination of non-confidential price data and should enable the calculation of European aggregates. Detailed data on the breakdown of consumption bands and their respective market shares are an essential part of natural gas and electricity price statistics. Members States should regularly prepare quality reports and assessments of the quality of the price data. Member States shall not be obliged to transmit data on natural gas prices for household customers to the Commission (Eurostat) if the consumption of natural gas in the household sector is below a threshold of 1 % of national total energy consumption in the household sector. Based on a justified request from a Member State, the Commission may grant derogations to Member States in relation to those specific obligations for which the application of this Regulation to the national statistical system of a Member State requires major adaptations and is likely to lead to a significant additional burden on respondents. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) are designed to measure inflation in a harmonised manner across Member States. The Commission and the European Central Bank use the HICP in their assessment of price stability in Member States under Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Harmonised consumer price indices are essential for assessing and measuring: (i) convergence in terms of price stability within the EU; and (ii) the results of euro area monetary policy, in terms of achieving the objective of price stability. In October 1995, a Council Regulation on harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) was drafted and adopted, followed by 20 implementing regulations in the following 17 years. Certain parameters have changed since the adoption of the original framework: (i) the development of the European Statistical System (ESS); (ii) the technical aspects of data collection and index compilation have changed dramatically due to the rapid rate of technological progress in recent years; (iii) the Lisbon Treaty established a new comitology set-up. These various changes all necessitate redrafting of the legislation on HICP so as to modernise and rationalise the legal basis and adapt it to today’s needs, both actual and potential. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish a common legal framework for the production of harmonised indices by Member States, which involves collecting, compiling, processing and submitting harmonised consumer price indices. The proposal for a revised HICP Regulation seeks to create a single legal measure covering all uniform conditions. It would combine the different implementing regulations into a single one, which would give stakeholders and Member States greater clarity and make administration easier and more effective. This proposal simplifies and clarifies the requirements for the compilation of these indices. It enshrines the principles of the European Statistics Code of Practice relating to commitment to quality, sound methodology, cost-effectiveness, relevance, accuracy, reliability, coherence and comparability. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission was amended by Council Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a new regulatory procedure with scrutiny (PRAC) for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the codecision procedure, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements. In a joint statement, the Parliament, the Council and the Commission listed a number of basic instruments that should be adapted to the amended Decision as a matter of urgency in order to incorporate the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (priority alignment). The Commission presented all the proposals regarding priority alignment in December 2006. These were examined and adopted by the Parliament and the Council. For the PRAC to be applicable to the other instruments adopted under the codecision procedure that were already in force at the time Decision 2006/512/EC came into effect, the joint statement also called for these instruments to be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures (general alignment). The Commission decided to carry out the alignment by means of proposals for 'omnibus' Regulations. The Commission adopted the first three proposals on 23 November (see COD/2007/0262 ) and 19 December 2007 (see COD/2007/0282 and COD/2007/0293 ). It adopted the last of the proposals on 11 February 2008 (see COD/2008/0032 ). On 23 September 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution with recommendations to the Commission on the alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision. In the resolution, the Parliament called on the Commission to present it with new legislative proposals to complete the general alignment. To this end, it provided the Commission with a list of 14 instruments which it deemed to require adaptation to the new Comitology Procedure but which were not covered by the Commission Communication of 23 November 2007. The Commission looked particularly closely at the 14 instruments to which its attention was drawn in the Parliament's resolution. All provisions in these basic instruments that delegate implementing powers to the Commission were carefully examined. On the basis of this examination, the Commission does not deem it necessary to present proposals for all these basic instruments. In the Commission's view, 12 of the instruments do not require adaptation to the new Comitology Procedure. However, the Commission acknowledges, with the European Parliament, that two basic instruments contain a number of provisions which do have to be adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny: · Directive 2000/15/EC amending Council Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine. · Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97. The purpose of the present proposal is to adapt these two basic instruments to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny."

BACKGROUND: Decision No 280/2004/EC concerning a mechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the Kyoto Protocol and its implementing provisions are the main monitoring, reporting, and verification instruments on GHG emissions. They set out the details for reporting anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks, for providing information on national programmes to reduce emissions, on GHG emission projections, and on climate change policies and measures in accordance with the UNFCCC. Six years of experience in implementing these two decisions and experience gained during international negotiations and in implementing various UNFCCC requirements have shown that there are areas where significant improvements could be made. In addition, the need to step up mitigation action at EU and Member State level and to fulfil new and upcoming international and domestic commitments, including the Europe 2020 strategy, requires an improved monitoring and reporting system. The Commission proposes replacing Decision No 280/2004/EC by a Regulation on account of the broader scope of the legislation, the increased number of addressees, the highly technical and harmonised nature of the monitoring mechanism, and to facilitate its implementation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a number of issues were dealt with in the impact assessment. These include: i) EU review and compliance cycle under the Effort Sharing Decision; ii) reporting requirements for emissions from international maritime transport; iii) reporting requirements related to the non-CO2 impacts of aviation on the global climate; iv) reporting requirements on adaptation; v) additional reporting requirements on LULUCF; v) reporting requirements on financial and technology support provided to developing countries; and vi) consistency with other EU legal instruments targeting air pollutants and improvements based on past experience with implementation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main objective of this Regulation is to help the Union and its Member States meet their national, Union, and international commitments and goals and to further develop policy through transparent, accurate, consistent, comparable and complete reporting. It seeks to improve the availability of information for Union policy and decision-making and the coordination and consistency of Union and Member State reporting under the UNFCCC. the enhancement of the monitoring, reporting and review framework within the EU thus enabling implementation of domestic and international commitments and enabling implementation of current policies and effective further policy development; setting up a Union level review process of the GHG data submitted by the Member States hence ensuring that compliance with the ESD targets is assessed in a comprehensive, transparent, credible and timely manner, as stipulated in the Climate and Energy package; a prudent approach to reporting on emissions from international maritime transport and the LULUCF sector where policy discussions, both within the Union and internationally, are ongoing. It ensures that the monitoring mechanism provides an adequate framework for setting detailed reporting requirements at a later stage when a concrete policy outcome is reached, be it at international or Union level; ensuring coherence with existing Union policy on the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, as it requires for the Commission to assess biennially those impacts on the basis of the latest available emission data and scientific advancements; annual reporting so as to enable the annual assessment of the commitments made by the EU at the national and international level but also so as to enable early and effective corrective action; enhances, with regard to finance and technology, reporting on the basis of common methods, in line with the Union's obligation to provide transparent and complete information on the financial and technology support it provides to developing countries; the improvement of existing national systems in the Member States to address reporting on projections, policies and measures and provides consistency with other legal instruments targeting air pollutants; better quality assurance / quality control to increase the quality and completeness of the data provided and to simplify existing reporting requirements without imposing an undue administrative burden.

In general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the EU's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the EU to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. A major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. The Commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next MFF period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: Financing instrument for development cooperation Partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) European Neighbourhood Instrument Instrument for nuclear safety cooperation Instrument for Stability Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide In parallel and for the first time, the Commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union’s instruments for external action. This is the purpose of the present proposal. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a priority for the Commission within the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate the availability of Union assistance to partner countries and regions, civil society organisations, SMEs, etc. to the extent that they contribute to the objectives of the Regulation. In the implementation of the new Instruments, simplified and flexible decision-making procedures would allow a swifter adoption of implementing measures and thus of delivery of EU assistance, in particular for countries in crisis, post-crisis and fragility. Furthermore, the revision of the Financial Regulation, which is particularly substantial with regard to the special provision on external actions, will facilitate the participation of civil society organisations and small businesses in funding programmes, for example by simplifying rules, reducing the costs of participation and accelerating award procedures. The Commission intends to implement this Regulation using the new flexible procedures provided for in the new Financial Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission performed an internal review of different reports (evaluations, audits, studies, mid-term reviews). The review looked at what worked and what did not work, and drew lessons for the drafting of the financial instruments. The review showed that the current Instruments contributed to progress towards the MDGs in developing countries. The implementation modalities, such as budget support and the ""sectorwide approach"", have allowed deeper cooperation with partner countries and a more efficient division of labour through co-financing between donors. Nevertheless, the review identified a number of shortcomings. The current implementation process was assessed as too complex and does not allow swift adjustments if required. These shortcomings have been directly addressed in the present Regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209(1) and 212 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes set of simplified rules and conditions for providing the Union's financial assistance to actions, including action programmes and other measures, under the following Instruments: the Development Cooperation Instrument (‘DCI’), the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (‘EIDHR’), the European Neighbourhood Instrument (‘ENI’), the Instrument for Stability (‘IfS’), the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (‘INSC’), the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (‘IPA’) and the Partnership Instrument (‘PI’). The proposal sets out the objectives of the Regulation which are to provide a harmonised set of implementing rules for Relex Instruments, to protect the financial interests of the Union, and to promote simplification and flexibility in implementing these Instruments. Adoption of Action Programmes, Individual Measures and Special Measures : the proposal provides that financing decisions taken by the Commission are to be in the form of action programmes, based on the multiannual programming documents. Exceptionally , individual measures can be adopted outside the action-programme framework. In the event of unforeseen and duly justified cases, the Commission may adopt special measures not provided for in the multiannual programming documents. Support measures : the proposal defines the types of expenditure that represent support to the implementation of this Regulation and which may be covered by Union financing (e.g. preparation, follow up, monitoring, audit and evaluation activities, provision of information and communication efforts). These measures can be financed outside the scope of the programming documents. Provisions on the financing methods : The Union's financial assistance may be provided, inter alia, through the following types of financing envisaged by the Financial Regulation: grants; procurement contracts for services, supplies or works; budget support; contributions to trust funds set up by the Commission; financial instruments such as loans, guarantees, equity or quasi-equity, investments or participations, and risk-sharing instruments, possibly combined with grants; shareholdings or equity participations in international financial institutions, including regional development banks. The Union's financial assistance may also be provided, in accordance with the Financial Regulation, through contributions to international, regional or national funds, such as those established or managed by the European Investment Bank, international organisations, Member States or by partner countries and regions, for attracting joint financing from a number of donors, or to funds set up by one or more donors for the purpose of the joint implementation of projects. Implementing tasks : the Union's financial assistance shall be implemented by the Commission as provided for by the Financial Regulation, directly by Commission departments, Union delegations and by executive agencies, or indirectly by entrusting budget implementation tasks to the entities listed in the Financial Regulation, including under shared management with Member states. Technical measures : the proposal also provides for innovative instruments, such as loans, guarantees, equity and risk-sharing instruments, and describes possible arrangements with respect to taxes, duties and charges. It describes that the measures under this Regulations may be implemented directly by the Commission or indirectly by entrusting budget implementation tasks to any entity or person listed in the Financial Regulation. This provision also defines the type of co-financing (parallel or joint). It also lays down measures to protect the Union's financial interests, and in particular to enable it (notably the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF) to carry out all the necessary checks on the measures implemented as well as conditions governing access to public procurement and grant awards for the purposes of implementing the Regulation. The proposed provisions are significantly simplified and indicate the objective to work towards untied aid delivery. Nevertheless, the articles introduce in detail the conditions for eligibility of third countries (reciprocity requirement, participation in the implemented programme, non-eligibility of certain countries, etc.) and exceptions thereto (unavailability of products or services provided, extreme urgency, triangular cooperation, etc.). Evaluation and implementation report : the Commission should regularly evaluate the results of the implemented policies and programmes, sectoral policies and the effectiveness of programming itself. All relevant stakeholders will be associated to the evaluation and the report will be shared with the Council and the European Parliament. No later than 31 December 2017, a report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of each of the Instruments by means of result and impact indicators measuring the efficiency of the use of resources and the European added value of the Instruments, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the types of actions implemented under the Instruments. The Commission shall examine the progress made in implementing the measures of financial assistance taken in external action and shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report every two years starting in 2016 on the implementation and results and, as far as possible, on the main outcomes and impacts of the Union's financial assistance. Specific tracking system based on the OECD methodology (‘Rio markers’) is proposed. By mid 2018, the Commission shall prepare and submit a report evaluating the implementation of this Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council, and, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal introducing the necessary modifications. Likewise, this report will assess the impact of the measures adopted on the basis of this Regulation. Comitology : the proposal describes the involvement of the relevant committees in the implementation of this Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the report on the ‘European Environment - State and Outlook 2020’, presented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on 4 December 2019, identified the unprecedented scale and urgency of the environmental, climate and sustainability challenges facing Europe today. These challenges require immediate and concerted action and urgent systemic solutions. The European Commission has responded to these challenges by adopting the ‘European Green Deal’, which aims to make the EU the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Following the debate on the communication ‘A clean planet for all’, in March 2020 the EU presented its long-term strategy under the Paris agreement on climate change, committing the EU to becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050. The Commission has proposed enshrining this target in EU climate law. In response to the coronavirus crisis, the ‘Next Generation EU recovery plan’ proposed by the European Commission on 27 May 2020 and endorsed by the Extraordinary European Council of July 2020 underlines the importance of the European Green Deal. As a follow-up to the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) which shall expire on 31 December 2020, the Commission is presenting a proposal for an 8th EAP, with a long-term vision and priority environmental objectives to support the EU's common commitment to achieve a green recovery. CONTENT: the proposal for a decision establishes a general action programme in the field of the environment for the period up to 31 December 2030 to accelerate the Union's transition towards a climate-neutral, clean, resource-efficient and circular economy in a fair and inclusive manner. The 8th EAP shall support the environment and climate action objectives of the European Green Deal in line with the long-term objective to ‘live well, within the planetary boundaries’ by 2050, which is already established in the 7th EAP. It shall contribute to achieving the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. Priority objectives The proposed 8th EAP sets thematic priority objectives in the areas of climate neutrality, adaptation to climate change, protection and restoration of biodiversity, aiming at zero pollution and reducing the pressures of production and consumption on the environment. It also sets out the conditions for achieving the long-term objectives and priority thematic objectives for all actors involved. Monitoring framework One of the key actions of the 8th EAP, announced by the European Green Deal, is a new monitoring framework to measure the progress made by the EU and its Member States in implementing the programme's priority objectives. The 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide the environment and climate input to the EU’s overall efforts to measure progress towards sustainability and shall inform policy makers and stakeholders if the Union and the Member States are on track to achieving a systemic transformation. The process to develop an 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide an opportunity to explore the potential of the ongoing workstream on the planetary boundaries (e.g. freshwater use, land use change, ocean acidification) and on the Union consumption footprint, including deforestation and forest degradation in third countries. Key indicators The 8th EAP monitoring framework should comprise a limited number of key indicators for high-level communication, which tell a coherent story about the state of the environment, the main pressures and the effectiveness of our response. On the basis of a consultation process with the other EU institutions, Member States and stakeholders, the Commission intends to present a set of key indicators for the 8th EAP by the end of 2021. Budgetary implications This proposal has been developed in line with the Commission proposal for the EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. It introduces the need for additional resources in the European Environment Agency (EEA) and in the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in supporting the new monitoring, measuring and reporting framework of this Programme. The estimated impact on operational expenditure for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 23.379 million for the EEA and EUR 2.369 million for ECHA. It is expected that Heading 3 of the MFF ‘Natural Resources and Environment’ shall maintain neutrality and shall not be impacted by this proposal. The resources needed for the EEA and ECHA shall be deducted from the LIFE budget according to a split of 2/3 of the costs for DG Environment and 1/3 of the costs of DG Climate Action for the EEA, while the resources needed for ECHA shall be fully covered by DG Environment."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event of serious emergencies whose scale and scope affect the whole of the European Union, a collective, coordinated and urgent response is needed to avoid a fragmented approach that would limit the effectiveness of the Union's response. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the need for better European Union preparedness for future large-scale emergencies, while highlighting the limitations of the current framework. In this context, it is proposed to make further amendments to the existing legal framework in order to strengthen the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The Union Mechanism has showed encouraging results in terms of performance in each of the three pillars (prevention/preparedness/response) so far. The Mechanism has proven to be a useful tool to mobilise and coordinate the assistance provided by the Participating States responding to crises inside and outside the Union, constituting a tangible proof of European solidarity. The Mechanism is generally well perceived by the participating States and key stakeholders. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to make certain targeted amendments to Council Decision No 1313/2013/EU on the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism. Building on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility, the overall objective of this proposal is to ensure that the Union can provide a better crisis and emergency support to its citizens in Europe and beyond. The decision is to be considered in parallel with the proposal also amending this mechanism. In line with the proposal for the new MFF 2021-2027, funding related to civil protection has been integrated into a single heading: Heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’. Objectives Specifically, the proposed amendments have the following objectives: - reinforce a cross-sectoral and societal preparedness approach to trans-boundary disaster risk management, including establishing a baseline and planning elements at a European level; - ensure that the Commission is able to directly procure an adequate safety net of rescEU capacities; - provide the Commission with the logistical capacity to provide multi-purpose air services in case of emergencies and to ensure timely transport and delivery of assistance; d) design a more flexible system for response to large-scale emergencies; - enhance the Emergency Response Coordination Centre’s operational coordination and monitoring role in support of the EU’s swift and effective response to a broad range of crises inside and outside the Union. The ERCC would be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and would be at the service of the Member States and the Commission in achieving the objectives of the Union's mechanism; - enable stronger investment in preparedness at Union level and further simplification of budget implementation; - enable the financing of operations of efficient and scalable sustainable recovery and resilience measures under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism by external assigned revenues through financing made available under the draft Regulation establishing a European Union Recovery Instrument to support the recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proposal envisages the deletion of Annex I, which currently establishes the relative percentages that each pillar of the Union Mechanism (prevention, preparedness and response) should receive in terms of funding from the overall financial envelope. As the COVID-19 outbreak has shown, the percentages outlined in Annex I do not appear to ensure sufficient flexibility so that the Union can achieve the objectives it has set. The proposal stresses the need for close coordination with actions under other EU policies and instruments, in particular with the new EU programme EU4Health. Proposed budget The total budget allocated for the Union Civil Protection Mechanism amounts to EUR 3 455 902 000 (in current prices) for the 2021-2027 period: - EUR 1 268 282 000 shall derive from heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’ of the MFF 2021-2027; - EUR 2 187 620 000 shall be made available through the European Recovery Instrument based on empowerment provided in the new Own Resources Decision."
1235EP7,"""""Extension of the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC to beneficiaries of international protection""""",0.035,0.872,0.825,0.161,0.242,0.819,0.841,0.829,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to extend the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC by including “beneficiaries of international protection”. PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/109/EC (see CNS/2001/0074) provides for the integration of third-country nationals who are long-term residents in the Member States. In 2001, the Commission had proposed that refugees should be able to qualify for long-term resident status after 5 years of legal and continuous residence in a Member States. However, it was finally decided to exclude refugees from the scope of the Directive. Thus, refugees as well as beneficiaries of international protection, are currently not entitled to long-term resident status. In the Joint Statement from the Council and the Commission, made at the JHA Council of 8 May 2003, it was agreed that the Commission would table a proposal for a Directive on the extension of long-term resident status to refugees and persons under subsidiary protection, taking into account the study on transfer of protection status. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal, therefore, is to amend Council Directive 2003/109/EC “concerning the status of third-country national who are long-term residents”, by extending its scope to include “beneficiaries of international protection”. “Beneficiaries of international protection” or beneficiaries of subsidiary protection are defined by Council Directive 2004/83/EC as “third country nationals or stateless persons who have been granted refugee or subsidiary protection status”. By extending the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC, beneficiaries of international protection will be entitled to he same legal certainty and rights as those enjoyed by EU nationals after five years of legal residence. In summary, the Commission is proposing the following amendments to the Directive: Long term resident status in a first Member State: Beneficiaries of international protection will be able to acquire long-term resident status in the Member State which has granted them protection subject to the same conditions as other third country nationals. In addition, beneficiaries of international protection who obtain long-term resident status should be able to enjoy the rights and benefits attached to this status and should be subject to the same restrictions and limitations of these rights. The initial grant of protection will require respect for the principle of non-refoulement, in the event of withdrawal or loss of the long-term resident status in the first Member State. Residence, and long-term resident status, in a second Member State : to recall, Chapter III of Directive 2003/109/EC sets out the conditions under which long-term residents may exercise their right of residence in another EU Member States. The Commission proposes that these conditions apply, in full, to beneficiaries of international protection who have been granted long-term residence. Beneficiaries of international protection applying under Article 23 of Directive 2003/109/EC for long-term resident status in a different Member State from that which granted them international protection should also be obliged to comply with all relevant conditions required by Directive 2003/109/EC. No Community mechanism on “transfer of responsibility” for protection under the amended Directive : Directive 2003/109/EC only grants, under certain conditions, the right to take up residence in a second Member States to those who have been granted long-term residency. It does not extend to beneficiaries of international protection. The Commission proposes that this issue remain outside the scope of the amended Directive. As a result, requests for transfer of protection remain governed by the 1951 Geneva Convention and by the European Agreement on transfer of responsibility for refugees concluded in the framework of the Council of Europe. Respecting the principle of non-refoulement by the second Member State: Since the proposal does not deal with the transfer of responsibility for international protection, the Commission points out that it is important to safeguard respect for the principle of non-refoulement in the second Member States. It is important, therefore, that the authorities of the second Member State are fully aware that a long-term resident applying for residence in the territory of that Member State was granted international protection in another Member States. To this end, the Commission proposes that this information be mentioned on the long-term residence permit. Readmission of a third country national with long-term resident status : for the cases where a long-term resident status has not yet been granted in the second Member State, Article 22 of Directive 2003/109/EC should also be amended so that the removal from the second Member State of long-term residents whose permits contain the remark stating that they are beneficiaries of international protection in another Member State - and who therefore may still have protection needs - is possible only to the first Member State; for the case where a long-term resident status was granted in the second Member State, Article 12 should be amended so as to provide that where the authorities of the second Member State consider the adoption of an expulsion measure, they are obliged to consult the authorities of the Member State which granted the protection to the person concerned. If this Member State confirms that the person is still a beneficiary of international protection, expulsion from the second Member State will only be possible to the Member State which originally granted the protection to the person concerned. However, both cases of readmission should be without prejudice to the provisions of Article 21(2) of Directive 2004/83/EC, regarding the exceptions to the protection from refoulement. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the necessary information exchange between Member States, Article 25 should be amended accordingly so as to allow the use of the network of national contact points also for that purpose. On a final point, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark are not bound by Directive 2003/109/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: on 16 September 2008, the Commission presented a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Second Council Directive 77/91/EEC on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent. In its opinion of 16 October 2008 the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services stated that the proposal does indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it. On 26 August 2010 the Commission presented an amended proposal for the codification of Directive 77/91/EEC, following subsequent amendments to it. In its further opinion of 12 October 2010 the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services stated that that amended proposal does indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it. In that opinion the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services also acknowledged that Article 6(3) of Directive 77/91/EEC, which corresponds to Article 6(2) in the proposed codified text, established a secondary legal basis. In the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of 6 May 2008 in Case C-133/06, it was considered necessary to redraft Article 6(2) of the proposed codified text. Since such a redrafting would imply a substantive change, and would therefore go beyond straightforward codification, it is therefore appropriate to transform the codification of Directive 77/91/EEC into a recast in order to incorporate the necessary amendment. The amendment to be made to Article 6(2) of the proposed codified text concerns the insertion of the words ""the European Parliament and"" before the words ""the Council"", in order to confer on both institutions the competence to examine and, if need be, revise the minimum amount of EUR 25 000 required for a company to be incorporated or obtain authorisation to commence business. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: the evaluation of Directive 91/533/EEC on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship (""Written Statement Directive"") has highlighted weaknesses in the scope of the Directive and indicated how its effectiveness could be improved. This Directive no longer corresponds to the evolution of the labour market, in particular as regards the new ""non-standard"" forms of employment which have appeared in the last ten years. Since 2014, more than five million jobs have been created, of which almost 20% in new forms of employment. The adaptability of new forms of employment to changes in the economic context has enabled new business models to develop, including in the collaborative economy, and has offered entry into the labour market to people who previously would have been excluded. In response some Member States have put in place new regulations and national social partners have developed new collective agreements, leading to an increasingly diverse regulatory system across the EU. This initiative is one of Commission's key actions to follow up on the European Pillar of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017. It also responds to the resolution of the European Parliament of 19 January 2017 requesting a framework Directive on decent working conditions in all forms of employment, and of 4 July 2017 on working conditions and precarious employment, calling for a revision of the 1991 Directive to take account of new forms of employment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred combination of measures shows that a substantial improvement of working and living conditions is expected. Most notably, at least 2-3 million non-standard workers will enter into the scope of the Directive. Enhanced predictability for some 4-7 million workers should have a positive impact on work-life balance and health. Some 14 million workers might request a new form of work. Lack of exclusivity clauses will allow some 90 000-360 000 on-demand workers to seek additional work and earn EUR 355-1 424 million per year extra. Non-quantified benefits for employers include higher retention and loyalty, improved worker relations, fewer complaints and court cases, better resource planning, contributing to an overall increase in productivity. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to replace the 1991 Written Statement Directive with a new instrument that ensures transparency about working conditions for all workers and defines new substantive rights to improve predictability and security of working conditions, particularly for those in precarious employment. The proposal: extends the scope of the Directive to forms of employment which are today often excluded , such as domestic work, casual workers (for instance those carrying out on-demand or intermittent work), short-term employees, domestic workers, platform workers or voucher-based workers. Member States could decide to exclude very short-term assignments of less than 8 hours per month from the scope of the Directive; provides that workers will receive up-to-date and detailed information (paper or electronic) from their first day of work. This information will cover: (i) probation (if any); (ii) training provided by employer; (iii) arrangements and remuneration for overtime; (iv) information on working time for workers on very variable schedules; (v) social security institution where contributions are paid; establishes minimum rights that apply to all workers in the Union : (i) limit the length of probationary periods to 6 months, unless longer is objectively justified; (ii) right to work for other employers, with a ban on exclusivity clauses and restrictions on incompatibility clauses; (iii) right to predictability of work: workers with variable working schedules determined by the employer (i.e. on-demand work) should know in advance when they can be requested to work; (iv) possibility to request a more stable form of employment and to receive a justified written reply (within 1 month; for SME's within 3 months and orally for repeated requests); (v) right to cost-free mandatory training; introduces two alternative procedures for addressing missing information : positive presumptions (if no relevant information supplied, no probation, permanent and/or full time employment relationship); administrative procedure to issue injunction to employer to supply missing information. The proposal also introduces provisions based on existing social acquis on compliance, right to redress, prevention of adverse treatment, burden of proof on dismissal, and penalties are introduced."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on comitology sets out the mechanism for the control of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers by Member States. Under the most frequently used procedure, the so-called “examination procedure”, the Commission representatives submit draft implementing acts to a committee composed of representatives from the Member States, which gives its opinion, generally by vote. The appeal committee was introduced in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 in order to elevate the debate, in particular in case the examination committee did not deliver an opinion, to a more political level. The Commission has found itself in the past years in a situation where it is legally obliged to take an authorisation decision in the absence of a qualified majority of the Member States taking position (either in favour or against) in the committee. This 'no opinion' situation is in the Commission's view particularly problematic when it concerns politically sensitive matters of direct impact on citizens and businesses, for instance in the field of health and safety of humans, animals or plants (e.g. GMOs or glyphosate). The Commission considered that Member States should, in these specific situations, also assume their responsibilities in the decision-making process to a greater extent. It is for this reason that it has proposed amendments to improve the functioning of the comitology procedures at the level of the appeal committee in order to ensure wider political accountability and ownership of politically sensitive implementing acts. CONTENT: this proposal provides for targeted and limited amendments to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 and thus relates to implementing acts only. The Commission proposes to: amend the voting rules for the appeal committee in order to reduce the risk of a no opinion scenario and to clarify the positions of the Member States. To this end, the proposal stipulates that only Member States which are present or represented, and which do not abstain, should be considered as participating Member States for the calculation of the qualified majority. In order to ensure that the voting outcome is representative a vote should only be considered valid if a simple majority of the Member States are participating members of the appeal committee; provide the possibility of a further referral to the appeal committee at ministerial level where no opinion is delivered. The changes proposed aim at reducing the risk of no opinion outcomes at the appeal committee level and at facilitating the decision-making and to ensure the political ownership of Member States of certain sensitive decisions; increase the transparency of the comitology procedure by proposing that the votes of the Member States' representatives taken in the appeal committee be made public (they are currently confidential); enable the Commission to formally refer specific cases after a no opinion outcome in the appeal committee for a non-binding opinion to the Council, with a view to obtaining its political orientation on the implications of the no opinion outcome."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). BACKGROUND : The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the Treaty (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the Treaty (implementing acts). In the case of delegated acts, the legislator delegates to the Commission the power to adopt quasi-legislative acts. In the case of implementing acts, the context is very different. Indeed, Member States are primarily responsible for the implementation of legally binding acts of the EU. However, if the application of the legislative act requires uniform conditions for its implementation the Commission is authorised to adopt these acts. Furthermore, Council Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred under Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. The alignment of Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 to the new rules of the Treaty is based on a classification on the basis of the new philosophy of the current Commission implementing powers. The classification has shown that all powers conferred to the Commission by this regulation are to adopt implementing acts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. CONTENT : the main provisions of this proposal are as follows: in order to ensure the efficient implementation of voluntary modulation the Commission is empowered , by means of implementing acts, to fix the net amounts resulting from the application of voluntary modulation. Given the nature of the implementing acts envisaged, the Commission should adopt those acts without the assistance of a committee; for the same reason the Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts with the assistance of the Rural Development Committee established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to ensure the integration of voluntary modulation in the rural development programming; furthermore, the Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts with the assistance of the Committee on the Agricultural funds established by Council Regulation (EC) 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, to ensure the financial management of voluntary modulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

The new Decision was to supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Meanwhile, it was necessary to amend Annex I to Decision No 1692/96/EC of to take account of the enlargement of the European Community to 27 Member States. It is therefore appropriate to transform the codification of Decision No 1692/96/EC into a recast in order to incorporate the amendments necessary for the adjustment to the enlargement. The necessary amendments consist of adding the maps relating to the 10 Member States listed in the 2003 Act of Accession in Annex I to the Decision to the existing maps relating to the 15 countries that were Members of the European Union before the enlargement of 1 May 2004. This amendment was provided for in Article 1(15) of Decision No 884/2004/EC and it must be made. In accordance with Decision No 884/2004/EC, the target date for the trans-European network outline plan for the 10 Member States in the 2003 Act of Accession is 2020 rather than 2010.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of the powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with Madagascar with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and this country. At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 19 June 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal calls on the Council to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar. Objectives: the primary objective of the Protocol to the Agreement is to grant fishing opportunities to EU vessels in the fishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar, in line with the management measures adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation, namely the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and where relevant, in keeping within the limits of the available surplus. The general objective is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Madagascar, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of Madagascar, in the interests of both parties. Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution, which is EUR 1 566 250 for each of the first two years of the Protocol and EUR 1 487 500 for each of the following two years, is based on: In the event of the annual amount of catches of the species referred to the Protocol exceeds the reference tonnage of 15 750 tonnes, the amount of the annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 55 during the first two years of the Protocol, and EUR 50 during the last two years for each additional tonne caught. However, the annual amount paid by the European Union in respect of access to Madagascar’s fishing zone shall not be more than twice the amount of the tonnage reference for the corresponding year. If the amounts caught by European Union vessels in Madagascar’s fishing zone exceed a quantity corresponding to twice that total annual amount, the amount due in respect of the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: New fishing opportunities: the new fishing opportunities and technical measures may be reviewed by mutual agreement within the Joint Committee. They may be adjusted by the Joint Committee insofar as the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the IOTC confirm that such adjustments guarantee the sustainable management of the fish species covered by this Protocol. In this case, the financial contribution shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis. Exploratory fishing surveys may be authorised in the Malagasy fishing zone to test the technical feasibility and economic viability of new fisheries. Duration of the Agreement: the new Protocol covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application – i.e. from the date of its signature and 1 January 2015 at the earliest. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total financial envelope allocated to this Protocol amounts to EUR 6.602 million from 2015 to 2018, including administrative management costs and human resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) ensures the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular the respect for private life, confidentiality of communications and the protection of personal data in the electronic communications sector. It also guarantees the free movement of electronic communications data, equipment and services in the Union. The Commission carried out an ex post evaluation of the ePrivacy Directive. It follows from the evaluation that the objectives and principles of the current framework remain sound. However, important technological and economic developments took place in the market since the last revision of the ePrivacy Directive in 2009. The Directive has not kept pace with technological developments, resulting in a void of protection of communications conveyed through new services. A Eurobarometer survey on ePrivacy was conducted throughout the EU. The key findings are the following: 78% say it is very important that personal information on their computer, smartphone or tablet can only be accessed with their permission; 72% state that it is very important that the confidentiality of their e-mails and online instant messaging is guaranteed; 89% agree with the suggested option that the default settings of their browser should stop the sharing of their information. This proposal seeks to update the legal framework. It aims at reinforcing trust and security in the Digital Single Market – a key objective of the Digital Single Market strategy. The draft Regulation also aligns the rules for electronic communications services with the new world-class standards of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option offers a measured reinforcement of privacy/confidentiality by extending the scope of the legal instrument to include new functionally equivalent electronic communications services and which protects against unsolicited communications and simplifies and clarifies the regulatory environment. CONTENT: this proposed new Regulation seeks to enhance protection of confidentiality of electronic communications by extending the scope of the legal instrument to include new functionally equivalent electronic communications services. Like the European Electronic Communications Code, this proposal also brings the Over-the-Top (OTT) providers in its scope to reflect the market reality. Confidentiality of electronic communications : the proposal: contains the key provisions ensuring the limited permitted purposes and conditions of processing such communications data: privacy will be guaranteed for both content and metadata derived from electronic communications (e.g. time of a call and location). Both have a high privacy component and, under the proposed rules, will need to be anonymised or deleted if users have not given their consent, unless the data is required for instance for billing purposes; addresses the protection of terminal equipment, by (i) guaranteeing the integrity of the information stored in it and (ii) protecting information emitted from terminal equipment, as it may enable the identification of its end-user; details the consent of end-users, where technically possible and feasible, consent may be expressed by using the appropriate technical settings of a software application enabling access to the internet. End-users who have consented to the processing of electronic communications data shall be given the possibility to withdraw their consent at any time and be reminded of this possibility at periodic intervals of 6 months, as long as the processing continue; imposes an obligation on providers of software permitting electronic communications to help end-users in making effective choices about privacy settings. Rights of end-users to control the sending and reception of electronic communications : with a view to protecting their privacy, the new Regulation proposed: the right of end-users to prevent the presentation of the calling line identification to guarantee anonymity; the obligation for providers of publicly available number-based interpersonal communication to provide for the possibility to limit the reception of unwanted calls; the regulation of the conditions under which end-users may be included in publicly available directories and the conditions under which unsolicited communications for direct marketing may be conducted. Supervision and enforcement of this Regulation : this shall be entrusted to the supervisory authorities in charge of the GDPR. The powers of the European Data Protection Board are extended and the cooperation and consistency mechanism foreseen under the GDPR will apply in case of cross-border matters related to this Regulation."

BACKGROUND: on the basis of a mandate granted to it by the Council, the European Commission on behalf of the Union negotiated with the Government of Denmark and Government of Greenland in view of renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and these two territorial entities. Following these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 20 March 2015. The new Protocol is in line with the objectives of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, strengthens the cooperation between the Union and Greenland and promotes a partnership framework in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the Greenlandic fishing zone in the interest of both Parties. CONTENT: with this proposal for a Decision, the Commission proposes the conclusion of a protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other. Period of application: the Fishing Protocol would cover a period of five years from the date of provisional application – i.e. from the date of its signature and from 1 January 2016 at the earliest. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol grants fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the fishing zone of Greenland, in line with relevant conservation and management measures and within the limits of the available surplus. To this effect, the protocol sets an indicative annual level of fishing opportunities granted by Greenland (in tonnes) to Union vessels by species: Following results to be assessed by the ICES Advisory Committee on the ongoing investigations and surveys at sea carried out on the different components of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Greenland waters and more particularly on spawners located West Greenland inshore, West Greenland offshore and East Greenland offshore, the Joint Committee may revise or adjust the indicative fishing opportunities for cod. Financial contribution: the Protocol provides for a total annual financial contribution of EUR 17.799.978 per year for its duration. This amount corresponds to: The two Parties have agreed to cooperate to implement Greenlandic sectorial fisheries policy and to that end shall continue the policy dialogue on the relevant programming. Specific provisions: provision is made for the setting of principles for responsible fisheries management. Provision is also made for an experimental fisheries programme for species not included in the protocol, as well as scientific cooperation on sustainable fishery exploitation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: type-approval requirements applying to 'L-category vehicles' as of 1 January 2016 are set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and its four delegated and implementing acts. The term ‘L-category vehicles’ covers a wide range of light vehicle types with two, three or four wheels, e.g. powered cycles, two- and three-wheel mopeds, two- and three-wheel motorcycles, motorcycles with side-cars and four-wheel vehicles (quadricycles) such as onroad quads, all-terrain vehicles and quadrimobiles. On the basis of the Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council on the comprehensive effect study of the environmental step Euro 5 for L-category vehicles and taking into account issues encountered by approval authorities and stakeholders in applying that Regulation, certain changes and clarifications should be made in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 in order to ensure its smooth application. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 168/2013 regarding the requirement to install an on-board diagnostic system (OBD I) which monitors for any electric circuit and electronics failure of the emission control system and which is triggered when the emission thresholds are being exceeded. OBD stage I systems for those vehicle (sub-) categories shall also report the triggering of any operating mode which significantly reduces engine torque. It is necessary to clarify the exemption for mopeds (L1e and L2e categories) from the OBD system of stage II requirement and to extend that exemption to light quadricycles (L6e category) and to the enduro (L3e-AxE) and trial (L3e-AxT) motorcycle subcategories. Regarding the requirement to install an on-board diagnostic system (OBD) of stage II, the Commission concluded on the basis of the comprehensive environmental effect study that there are technical limitations with respect to catalyst monitoring for certain vehicles and that further development is required to ensure its correct implementation. Catalyst monitoring is not expected to be ready for the first round of the Euro 5 emission step, but should be envisaged for 2025. The amending Regulation therefore provides for the time necessary to ensure the correct implementation of OBD system of stage II requirement. In addition, the European Commission would have additional powers to adopt delegated acts to implement Regulation (EC) No 168/2013: the powers initially granted expired on 21 March 2018. The proposal provides for an extension of the delegation for a further five years, with the possibility of tacit extension."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while investment conditions in Europe have improved since the launch of the Juncker plan in 2014, thanks to a more favourable economic situation and government interventions such as the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI), there is still a significant investment gap in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major shock to the world and EU economies. The contraction of EU GDP in 2020 - forecast at around 7.5% - is expected to be much deeper than during the 2009 financial crisis. For the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission therefore considers it necessary to propose a reinforced EU investment programme to provide crucial support to businesses and to ensure a strong focus of private investors on the Union's medium and long-term priorities, including the Green Deal for Europe and digital transitions, as well as increased resilience. This is why the Commission is withdrawing its May 2018 proposal for the InvestEU programme and submitting a new proposal that takes full account of the partial agreement reached in April 2019 between the Parliament and the Council. This new proposal (i) increases the amount of the initially proposed financial envelope (ii) amends the scope of the proposal to reflect on the post-pandemic needs of the European economy. It builds on the lessons learned from the EFSI evaluations and previous financial instruments (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020, COSME, Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme etc.). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to create the InvestEU programme for the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027 in order to bring together under a single structure all financing from the EU budget in the form of loans and guarantees. The InvestEU programme shall be based on the following elements: The InvestEU Fund The InvestEU Fund shall mobilise public and private investment through a EU budget guarantee of EUR 75 153 850 000 (in current prices) which aims to support the investment projects of implementing partners. The Commission proposes that the guarantee be provisioned at 45%, which means that EUR 33 800 000 000 from the EU budget shall be set aside in case calls are made on the guarantee. The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group shall remain a privileged implementing partner for the Invest EU. It shall implement 75% of the EU guarantee. National development banks or institutions may also become implementing partners. Five policy windows The InvestEU Fund shall operate through 5 policy windows, each of which is aimed at addressing market failures or investment shortfalls within their specific scope: 1. sustainable infrastructure; 2. research, innovation and digitisation; 3. SMEs; 4. social investment and skills; 5. strategic European investments. In addition to increasing the resources of the sustainable infrastructure window, the Commission proposes to broaden the scope of the programme by adding a fifth strand - strategic European investment - with a view to meeting the future needs of the European economy and promoting and ensuring the strategic autonomy of the Union in key sectors. This window shall be endowed with an amount of up to EUR 31 153 850 000. This new window shall support final recipients established in a Member State and carrying out an activity of strategic importance to the Union, in particular with a view to green and digital transitions and increased resilience in areas such as: - provision of critical health care, manufacturing and stockpiling of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and medical supplies, strengthening the capacity to respond to health crises; - critical infrastructure (e.g. energy, transport, environment, health, 5G, Internet of Things); - key enabling, transformative, green and digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, block chains, renewable energy technologies, biomedicine). The InvestEU Advisory Hub The advisory hub would provide technical support and assistance in the preparation, development, structuring and implementation of projects, including capacity-building. The EIB Group would play a central role in the implementation of advisory support under the Hub. A financial envelope of EUR 724 733 000 (in current prices) is foreseen for the InvestEU Advisory Hub. The InvestEU Portal The InvestEU Portal shall be established to provide for an easily accessible and user-friendly project database to promote visibility of investment projects searching for financing with enhanced focus on the provision of a possible pipeline of investment projects, compatible with Union law and policies. Governance An investment committee of independent experts shall remain responsible for approving individual requests. The Commission performs a policy check on proposed financing or investment operations to verify that they are compliant with EU law before a proposal is submitted to the Investment Committee. Budgetary implications For the period 2021-2027, the budgetary framework (commitments at current prices) foreseen for the InvestEU programme amounts to EUR 33 524 733 000. The overall provisioning will amount to EUR 33 800 million, of which EUR 1 billion will be covered by revenues, repayments and recoveries generated by existing financial instruments and the EFSI."

The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. The EU published its Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan in 2003. The plan aims to combat illegal logging around the world. By entering Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with timber producing third countries, the EU opens for imports of legally sourced timber and timber products to enter the Single Market. These agreements are binding trade agreements. They also contribute to better regulation and governance of the forest sector in the exporting country. Honduras was the first Latin American country to initiate and successfully conclude negotiations for a VPA with the EU. These negotiations started in 2013 and were completed in 2018. Honduras is also the first VPA partner that has included indigenous peoples as a separate interest group at the negotiating table. For the EU, this agreement is in line with its objectives under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, the Aichi Targets of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030. Within these frameworks, it is committed to, inter alia, encouraging sustainable forest management, combating deforestation and forest degradation and promoting sustainable development. The Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the EU and Honduras: - establishes the framework, institutions and systems for the timber legality assurance system for the FLEGT licensing scheme; - sets out the framework for monitoring compliance and for independent evaluation of the system; - includes a clear commitment by Honduras to develop legislation to ensure that timber imported in Honduras has been legally harvested in compliance with the applicable legislation in the country of harvest; - establishes a mechanism for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Honduras on the FLEGT licensing scheme, via a Joint Implementation Committee; - establishes principles of stakeholder participation, social safeguards, accountability and transparency, and mechanisms for complaints on, monitoring of and reporting on implementation of the Agreement.

1298EP7,"""""Control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers""""",0.614,0.788,0.86,0.613,0.485,0.855,0.738,0.514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty of Lisbon substantially modifies the framework for implementing powers that are conferred upon the Commission by the legislator. Contrary to the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community (""the EC Treaty""), the new Treaty makes a clear distinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), on the one hand, and the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts, on the other hand. They are subject to entirely different legal frameworks: the provisions of the new Treaty on delegated acts, which are set out in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (""the Treaty""), provide for the legislator to control the exercise of the Commission's powers by means of a right of revocation and/or a right of objection. These provisions are sufficient in themselves and do not require any legally binding framework to make them operational. the provisions of the new Treaty on implementing acts, which are set out in Article 291, do not provide any role for the European Parliament and the Council to control the Commission's exercise of implementing powers. Such control can only be exercised by the Member States. A legal framework is required to establish the mechanisms of such control. The provisions of the new Treaty also put the co-legislators on an equal footing in relation to the conferral of delegated and implementing powers. Under the EC Treaty it was the Council that could confer implementing powers on the Commission. The Council could also reserve implementing powers to itself in specific cases. Under the new Treaty provisions it is a direct obligation deriving from the Treaty that acts must confer implementing powers on the Commission where this is needed in view of ensuring uniform implementation of these acts. Those acts can also, in duly justified specific cases and in the cases provided for in Articles 24 and 26 of the Treaty on European Union, confer implementing powers on the Council instead of the Commission. This does not imply, however, that the Council has any role in controlling the exercise of implementing powers when these are conferred on the Commission. The new Treaty clearly entails that it is the Member States, and they alone, that control the implementation by the Commission where such control is required by a legally binding Union act. As regards the implementation of Article 290 of the Treaty, the Commission has set out its views on the scope of delegated acts in a Communication. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 291(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal is guided by the new provisions of the Treaty and the new institutional context described above. However, the proposal also draws on Council Decision 1999/468/EC (""the Comitology Decision"") and experience gained in implementing that Decision, whilst simplifying its provisions taking into account in particular the following general principles: (i) it is the Member States that are responsible for controlling the Commission's exercise of implementing powers; and (ii) procedural requirements should be proportionate to the nature of implementing acts. The key elements of the proposal that include similarities and innovations in comparison with the ‘Comitology’ Decision are as follows: - the proposal maintains the Committee structure provided for in the Comitology Decision (Article 3), but rationalises it ; there are only two procedures: the advisory procedure, which mirrors the existing advisory procedure, and a new examination procedure, which will replace - the existing management and regulatory procedures (Articles 4 and 5); the advisory procedure is the general rule and can be applied to all policy domains and for all types of binding implementing measures (Article 2(3)); - the criteria for the choice of the examination procedure mirror those provided for in the Comitology Decision. Nevertheless, these criteria are binding in the sense that only when the criteria are met can the examination procedure in question be used (Article 2(2)); - the examination procedure (Article 5): the main provisions are as follows: where the Committee delivers a negative opinion on the draft measures, the Commission may not adopt them. The Commission may re-submit the draft to the committee for a second deliberation, or table an amended draft. In very exceptional circumstances, the Commission would be able to adopt the draft measures despite a negative opinion but in such a case the committee would have the last word within a time-period which will not exceed one month; where no opinion is reached, the Commission may ultimately decide whether to adopt the measures or not, taking into account inter alia the positions expressed within the committee; in the case of a positive opinion of the committee, the Commission will adopt the measures unless exceptional circumstances or new elements justify them not being adopted. - there are specific procedures for measures to apply immediately on imperative grounds of urgency and where this is provided for in a basic act (Article 6); - the proposal maintains provisions relating to the rules of procedures of committees (Article 7) and regarding public access to information on committee proceedings (Article 8(3)); - building on experience gained with the implementation of the Comitology Decision, the proposal also includes a number of important provisions that are common practice but were not covered by the Decision. These include the provisions for the use of written procedures (Article 3 (5)) in order to obtain the committee's opinion and the possibility for amending draft measures in order to take into account discussions in the committee prior to it delivering its formal opinion (Article 3 (4)); - both legislators should be properly and continuously informed of committee proceedings through the continued use of the existing Comitology Register, which would be adapted to the new procedures; - lastly, for reasons of clarity, consistency and efficiency, the proposal provides for an automatic alignment of the existing acquis to the new procedures (Article 10). The adaptation to the new system will not affect pending procedures in which an opinion has already been delivered. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: The proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while Member States are responsible for their health policies, the experience gained during the COVID-19 crisis has shown the need to significantly strengthen the EU's capacity to respond effectively to major health threats. Europe needs to give higher priority to health, to have health systems ready to provide state-of-the-art care and to be prepared to deal with epidemics and other unpredictable health threats, in line with the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Commission proposes that an ambitious stand-alone programme, called the EU4Health Programme, is the key instrument to implement this strategy. The new programme will be essential to ensure that the EU remains the healthiest region in the world, that it has all possible tools to address health challenges at national and European level and that it is ready to respond to any new and emerging health threats that may endanger the population of the EU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to establish a new programme for EU action in the field of health, entitled ‘EU4Health Programme’ (EU4Health) for the period 2021-2027. General objectives The Programme shall pursue the following general objectives: (1) protect people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health; (2) improve the availability in the Union of medicines, medical devices and other crisis relevant products, contribute to their affordability, and support innovation; (3) strengthen health systems and the healthcare workforce, including by digital transformation and by increased integrated and coordinated work among the Member States, sustained implementation of best practice and data sharing, to increase the general level of public health. From the point of view of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, the Programme should help to ensure that the EU is better prepared to deal with future health threats that would affect all or a large part of its territory. The Programme shall: - support Member States in the transition to better preparedness and the reinforcement of their health systems and support them in achieving the health-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); - set out key action areas such as improvement of national health systems, measures against communicable and non-communicable diseases, availability and affordability of medicines and other crisis relevant products; - address inequalities by benchmarking, providing support and closing identified gaps between countries, regions, population groups and citizens; - provide tools for enhanced solidarity in preparedness and crisis response, as well as in finding common ground to improve prevention and in addressing non-communicable diseases, and in particular cancer, and for better coordinating between different policies, tools and financial instruments; - contribute to tackling the negative impact of climate change and environmental degradation on human health; - support actions to enable the Commission to complement the necessary regulatory framework and contribute to addressing the significant structural needs identified in the COVID-19 crisis. Implementation The Programme shall be implemented through direct or indirect management and shall make use of the most commonly used spending mechanisms of the Union budget, including public procurement, prizes and grants. Funding for health under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027 includes several instruments such as the European Social Fund plus (ESF+), the European Regional Development Fund, the Horizon Europe Programme, the Digital Europe Programme and the Interconnection in Europe 2 mechanism. Working across programmes and sharing objectives between strategies will be key to channelling health funds between strategies and supporting the achievement of their objectives more effectively than before. Proposed budget The total budget allocated to the programme shall amount to EUR 10 397 614 000 (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027: - EUR 1 946 614 000 shall derive from heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’ of the MFF for the period 2021-2027; - EUR 8 451 000 000 shall derive from proceeds of the EU Recovery Instrument, constituting external assigned revenues."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the western Mediterranean is one of the most developed sub-regions in terms of fisheries in the Mediterranean. It accounts for around 31 % of its total landing (EUR 1.35 billion out of a total of EUR 4.76 billion) and around 19 % of the officially reported Mediterranean fishing fleet. Demersal fisheries are highly sought after by fishermen due to their high commercial value. Demersal fisheries in the Mediterranean are highly complex and involve many species of fish and crustaceans. The main demersal species caught in the western Mediterranean are hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp and Norway lobster. The main gear used for demersal species are trawl nets, which have the largest catch and fleet power, but passive gears such as trammel nets, gillnets, traps and longlines are also important. Demersal fisheries in the western Mediterranean are currently managed through national management plans adopted under Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 (the ‘MedReg’). Spain, France and Italy have adopted plans in accordance with this Regulation. These plans have proved ineffective in achieving the objectives set by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (""STECF"") has shown that the exploitation of most demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean far exceeds the levels required to reach maximum sustainable yield (MSY): more than 80% assessed stocks are overfished in this sub-region. In addition, the biomass of some of these stocks is close to the limit reference point, indicating that there is a high probability of collapse. The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to establish a multiannual plan for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: taking into account all the evidence collected and analysed through the impact assessment process, the preferred option is a multi-annual plan at EU level. The reasons for this are as follows: the multi-annual plan would have more positive environmental impacts. In particular, the probability of achieving fishing mortality targets for all stocks would be around 36 %; around 70 % of the assessed stocks would recover to spawning stock biomass (SSB) levels above the precautionary reference point; socio-economic performance is expected to improve across all fleets by 2025; a multi-annual plan would be streamlined (a single regulatory framework), stable (it considers the long-term perspective) and transparent (the three Member States concerned would jointly bring fishing mortalities to sustainable levels). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation aims to address the high levels of overfishing and the ineffective regulatory framework by introducing for the first time a multi-annual plan at EU level. Its aim is to achieve the objectives of the CFP Regulation in western Mediterranean demersal fisheries, namely with regards to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and managed in a way that secure economic, social and employment benefits. The plan will also facilitate implementation of the landing obligation and enable a regionalised approach, whereby the Member States concerned would be involved in the design of management measures. The proposal applies to the stocks driving demersal fisheries (i.e. hake, red mullet, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp, giant red shrimp and Norway lobster), by-catch stocks and other demersal stocks for which sufficient data are not available. It also applies to commercial and recreational fisheries exploiting those stocks in the western Mediterranean. The proposal: lays down quantifiable targets for fishing mortality which should be achieved by 2020 at the latest. The ranges would allow for MSY-based management of the stocks concerned, while providing some flexibility in the context of mixed fisheries; introduces, for each stock, a limit reference point (or biomass limit, BLIM) at which the stock would be in serious danger of collapse and a precautionary reference point (or biomass precautionary, BPA) as a safety margin; introduces safeguard measures to allow a stock to recover in the event of the precautionary or limit reference points being exceeded; introduces a fishing effort regime at EU level for all trawls in the areas and vessels length categories in Annex I; sets a spatio-temporal closure prohibiting trawls from operating within the 100 m isobath from 1 May to 31 July each year. This would reserve the coastal zone for more selective gears in order to protect nursery areas and sensitive habitats, and enhance the social sustainability of small-scale fisheries; introduces regionalisation provisions as required to extend and/or amend exemptions for species with demonstrated high survival rates and de minimis exemptions; establishes regional cooperation among Member States with a view to adopting provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures, including technical measures, for certain stocks; introduces scientific monitoring to assess progress towards maximum sustainable yield for the stocks driving demersal fisheries and, where possible, by-catch stocks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no impact on the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
6918EP7,"""""Infringements of competition law""""",0.737,0.744,0.807,0.548,0.333,0.735,0.733,0.514,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to facilitate the introduction of damage and interest claims by victims of antitrust violations. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: damages claims for breaches of Articles 101 or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) constitute an important area of private enforcement of EU competition law. The Court of Justice of the European Union has clarified that the full effectiveness of the EU competition rules and, in particular, the practical effect of the prohibitions they contain would be put at risk if it were not open to any person to claim damages for loss caused to him/her by a contract or conduct liable to restrict or distort competition. It considered that damages actions strengthen the working of the EU competition rules and can thus make a significant contribution to maintaining effective competition in the EU. While the right to full compensation is guaranteed by the Treaty itself, the practical exercise of this right is often rendered difficult or almost impossible because of the applicable rules and procedures. Despite some recent signs of improvement in a few Member States, to date most victims of infringements of the EU competition rules in practice do not obtain compensation for the harm suffered. Besides these specific substantive obstacles to effective compensation (already identified in the Commission’s 2005 Green Paper), there is a wide diversity as regards the national legal rules governing antitrust damages actions. To remedy this situation, the Commission put forward concrete policy proposals in its 2008 White Paper. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment report focused on four options which ranged from no action at the EU level, through a soft-law approach, to two options for legally binding EU action. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 103 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to ensure the effective enforcement of the EU competition rules in particular by ensuring that victims of infringements of the EU competition rules can obtain full compensation for the harm they suffered. Scope: the proposed Directive would set out rules ensuring equivalent protection throughout the Union for all natural or legal persons for harm they they have suffered as a result of infringements of the EU competition rules and ensure that their right under EU law to full compensation can be effectively exercised in the national courts. Disclosure of evidence: provision is made to ensure that, under certain conditions, the national courts can order the defendant or a third party to disclose the evidence a claimant will need to prove his his antitrust damages claim and/or a related defence. National courts should have at their disposal effective measures to protect any business secrets or otherwise confidential information disclosed during the proceedings. Furthermore, disclosure should not be allowed where it would be contrary to certain rights and obligations such as the obligation of professional secrecy. Probative effect of national decisions: pursuant to Council Regulation No 1/2003, a Commission decision relating to proceedings under Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty has a probative effect in subsequent actions for damages. It is proposed to give final infringement decisions by national competition authorities (or by a national review court) similar effect. Limitation periods: the Commission proposes that the national rules on limitation periods for a damages action: (i) allow victims sufficient time (at least five years) to bring an action after they became aware of the infringement, the harm it caused and the identity of the infringer; (ii) prevent a limitation period from starting to run before the day on which a continuous or repeated infringement ceases. Joint and several liability: where several undertakings infringe the competition rules jointly (typically in the case of a cartel), it is appropriate that they be jointly and severally liable for the entire harm caused by the infringement. The new proposal, however, introduces certain modifications with regard to the liability regime of immunity recipients. Passing-on of overcharges: i njured parties are entitled to compensation for actual loss (overcharge harm) and for loss of profit. To ensure that only the direct and indirect purchasers that actually suffered overcharge harm can effectively claim compensation, the proposed Directive explicitly recognises the possibility for the infringing undertaking to invoke the passing-on defence. However, in situations where the overcharge was passed on to natural or legal persons at the next level of the supply chain for whom it is legally impossible to claim compensation, the passing-on defence cannot be invoked. Quantification of harm: to assist victims of a cartel in quantifying the harm caused by the competition law infringement, the proposed Directive provides for a rebuttable presumption with regard to the existence of harm resulting from a cartel. The infringing undertaking could rebut this presumption and use the evidence at its disposal to prove that the cartel did not cause harm. Consensual Dispute Resolution: to provide an incentive to parties to settle their dispute consensually, the proposed Directive aims at optimising the balance between out-of-court settlements and actions for damages. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed Directive would have no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 77(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the positive list). The determination of those third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating inter alia to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the EU’s external relations with third countries. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. In view of the criteria of public order and illegal immigration, particular attention should be paid also to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed when appropriate. Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 has been amended most recently with regard to the outcome of the visa liberalisation dialogues by transferring the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia to the positive list. In a joint Declaration adopted in November 2009, the European Parliament and the Council underlined their political support for a quick abolition of the visa regime for the citizens of these two countries and urged the authorities of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina to intensify efforts to comply with all the benchmarks set out in the Commission's roadmaps. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council invited the Commission to present a legislative proposal for amending the Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as soon as it had assessed that each country meets the benchmarks of the roadmaps, and took the commitment to examine the Commission proposal as a matter of urgency. In April 2010, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council its assessment of the progress made by these two countries in the implementation of the remaining open benchmarks of the roadmaps towards visa liberalisation. The assessment reports concluded that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina made important progress and only a very limited number of benchmarks remain open. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: none CONTENT: in proposing this amendment to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1244/2009, the Commission is pursuing the objective of adjusting the annexes to the Regulation, taking into consideration the progress made in the visa liberalisation dialogues with Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the last seven months and transferring these two countries from Annex I (the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States) to the Annex II (the list of those third countries whose nationals are exempt from that requirement) of the Regulation. This transfer is in line with the political commitment taken by the EU on the liberalisation of the short-stay visa requirement for all Western Balkan citizens as part of the Thessaloniki agenda. Considering the introduction of biometric passports by the Western Balkan countries as an element of fundamental importance for the successful completion of the regional visa liberalisation process and as in Regulation (EC) No 1244/2009, the proposal, for reasons relating to security and prevention of illegal migration, limits the visa waiver for the citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina to those persons holding the new biometric passports issued by these countries. In parallel with the examination of its proposal in the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission will continue to assess the implementation of the open benchmarks for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina and it will share its assessment in a timely manner with the European Parliament and the Council. For Albania, the remaining open benchmarks relate to: the development of a strategy and policy to support the reintegration of Albanian returnees; the strengthening of capacities of law enforcement and the effective implementation of the legal framework for the fight against organised crime and corruption, including through the allocation of adequate human and financial resources; the effective implementation of the legal framework in the area of the confiscation of organised crime assets. For Bosnia and Herzegovina, the remaining open benchmarks relate to: the strengthening of capacities of law enforcement and the effective implementation of the legal framework for the fight against organised crime and corruption, including through the allocation of adequate human and financial resources; the progressive implementation of the action plan from March 2010 on establishment of electronic data exchange between police and prosecution bodies ; the harmonisation of the criminal codes of the entity level and Brcko district with the state-level criminal code. As in Regulation (EC) No 1244/2009, there is no reason to make the implementation of the visa waiver for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina contingent on the conclusion of visa waiver agreements with the EU, taking into account the European vocation of these two countries and the fact that they have already exempted all EU citizens from the visa requirement. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment has no implication on the European Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is faced with potential threats to the security of gas supply, mainly linked to its dependence for primary energy from third countries. The escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine since February 2022 has led to unprecedented price increases. These price increases are likely to fundamentally change the incentives to fill storage facilities in the Union. In the current geopolitical context, further supply disruptions of gas can no longer be excluded. This could severely harm citizens and the economy of the Union, as the Union is still to a significant extent dependent on external gas supplies which can be affected by the conflict. It is therefore crucial that the EU acts in a coordinated manner to avoid potential risks resulting from a possible gas supply interruption. CONTENT: this proposal amends two existing regulations, Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and Regulation (EU) 715/2009 on conditions for access to natural gas transmission networks. It builds on the existing framework for gas security of supply and internal gas market rules, adding further measures needed to ensure security of supply of natural gas in the Union in the context of the severe energy crisis caused by recent changes of the geopolitical situation. The proposal aims notably at ensuring that storage capacities in the Union, which are crucial to ensure security of supply, do not remain unused, to ensure that storages can be shared across the Union, in a spirit of solidarity. Mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities The proposal seeks to ensure that a mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities will reinforce the security of supply ahead of the winter 2022/2023 and for the following winter periods. A new provision will require the Member States to ensure that the storage infrastructures in its territory are, in principle, filled up to at least 90% of their capacity at Member State level by 1 November each year, with intermediary targets for each Member State in February, May, July, and September. For 2022, the filling target is set at 80% of the capacity of all storage facilities located on the territory of the respective Member States. The Commission is mandated to ensure that the filling targets are met in case intermediate targets are missed. Certification of storage system operators A new mandatory certification of all storage system operators will avoid potential risks resulting from outside influence over critical storage infrastructure, meaning that non-certified operators will have to give up ownership or control of EU gas storage facilities. In addition, for a gas storage facility to close down its operations it would need to have an authorisation from the national regulator. Burden sharing mechanism The proposal introduced a burden sharing mechanism, as although not all Member States have storage facilities in their territories, all will benefit from having a guaranteed high filling level, in terms of the insurance value against security of supply risks and price dampening effects in winter. New filling obligations Competent authorities will continuously monitor the filling of the underground storage facilities in order to ensure that their national filling trajectories are met. This new provision also reinforces the role of the Gas Coordination Group, giving it an explicit mandate to monitor Member States' performance in the area of gas security of supply, and to develop best practices on that basis. Tariff rebate In order to incentivise the refilling of EU gas storage facilities, the Commission is proposing a 100% discount on capacity-based transmission tariffs at entry and exit points of storage facilities."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is having a very negative impact on the economic and financial stability of the regions affected by enlargement and the neighbourhood policy. Most, if not all, enlargement and neighbourhood partners are set for a recession this year. Depending on the spread of the virus, as well as of its economic consequences, there is also a clear and imminent risk related to social stability and security, with possible spill-overs within the region and beyond. In these circumstances, the European Commission proposes to use Macro Financial Assistance (MFA) to support ten Neighbourhood countries in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. MFA is one of the instruments available to the EU to respond to external crises. It is used to address balance of payments crisis situations, in tandem with a disbursing International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangement that is subject to an agreed programme of economic reforms. The proposal is part of the ‘Team Europe’ strategy, which is the targeted response by which the EU intends to support its partners in their fight against the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to make available to partners a total of up to EUR 3 billion in medium and long-term loans to help cover their external financing needs in 2020 and 2021. Breakdown of the AMF Based on a preliminary assessment of financing needs, the amounts of MFA to be made available shall be distributed to the beneficiaries as follows:  Republic of Albania (EUR 180 million); Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUR 250 million); Georgia (EUR 150 million); Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (EUR 200 million); Kosovo (EUR 100 million); Republic of Moldova (EUR 100 million); Montenegro (EUR 60 million); Republic of Northern Macedonia (EUR 160 million); Republic of Tunisia (EUR 600 million); Ukraine (EUR 1.2 billion). The proposed MFA amounts would be made available to the beneficiary countries for 12 months in the form of loans granted on very favourable terms to help them meet their immediate and urgent financing needs. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2020. The second instalment could be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first half of 2021 provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. Objectives and conditions Combined with IMF support, this financing shall:  contribute to covering the external financing needs of the partner in the context of a significant deterioration of their external accounts brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis; alleviate the partner’s budgetary financing needs; support the fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of the foreseen IMF programme; support structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management, strengthening economic governance and transparency, and improving conditions for sustainable growth. The granting of the EU MFA shall be subject to:  the pre-condition that the partner respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights; satisfactory progress with the IMF programme and the continued drawing by the partner on IMF funds. The Commission shall report yearly to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year. Furthermore, the fulfilment of the objectives of the assistance shall be assessed not later than two years after the expiry of the availability period of the assistance. Budgetary implications The planned assistance shall be provided in the form of loans and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission shall conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance shall correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the Guarantee Fund for External Actions of the EU. The Commission considers that the budgetary impact of the proposed MFA operations can be accommodated within the Commission’s proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of Korea with a view to conclude an EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement. The agreement was then initialled on 15 October 2009. The agreement incorporates a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility of re-imposing the MFN (Most Favoured Nation) rate when as a result of a trade liberalisation imports take place in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. In order for these measures to be operational, such safeguard clause must be incorporated in EU law not least because the procedural aspects of the imposition of safeguard measures as well as the rights of interested parties, such as the right of defence, need to be specified. CONTENT: this proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause of the EU-Korea FTA. The main points are as follows: Principles: a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the provisions set out in the Regulation where a product originating in Korea is, as a result of the reduction or the elimination of the customs duties on that product, being imported in the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: suspensions of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the good concerned provided for under the Agreement; or increases of the rate of customs duty on the good to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the good in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the base rate of customs duty specified in the Schedules in the Annex of the Agreement. The terms ""serious injury"", ""threat of serious injury"" and ""transition period"" are defined in the text. Initiation of proceedings : the proposal lays down detailed provisions on the initiation of proceedings. The Commission should receive information including available evidence from Member States of any trends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures. If there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding the Commission will publish a notice as provided for in the Agreement in the Official Journal of the European Union. The investigation : the proposal lays down detailed provisions on the opening of investigations, access and inspections by interested parties to the information gathered, hearings for the parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views as provided for in the Agreement. The Commission shall notify the Republic of Korea in writing of the initiation of an investigation and consult with the Republic of Korea as far in advance of applying a bilateral safeguard measure as practicable, with a view to reviewing the information arising from the investigation and exchanging views on the measure. Pursuant to the Agreement, the proposal sets time limits for the initiation of investigations and for determinations as to whether or not measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : an investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure. However, there is the reservation that the Commission be allowed to apply provisional measures in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports of an originating good from Korea have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under the Agreement, and such imports cause serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. Provisional measures shall not apply for more than 200 days. Termination of investigation and proceeding without measures : where bilateral safeguard measures are deemed unnecessary the investigation and proceeding shall be terminated. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that the circumstances set out in the text are met, a decision to impose definitive bilateral safeguard measures shall be taken in accordance with the Comitology procedure referred to in the proposal. Duration and review of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, unless it is extended. The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. A safeguard measure shall not be applied beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the consent of the Republic of Korea. Lastly, the proposal lays down rules on confidentiality, committee and decision making process. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: not applicable."
1769EP7,"""""Transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries""""",0.667,0.799,0.0,0.548,0.121,0.795,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE : to establish the terms, conditions and the procedure under which Member States are authorised to maintain in force, amend or conclude bilateral agreements with third countries relating to investment. PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the TFEU) establishes the EU's exclusive competence on foreign direct investment, as part of the common commercial policy . Prior to the entry into force of the TFEU, Member States concluded more than 1000 bilateral agreements relating to investment with third countries, which relate in part or in full to foreign direct investment. Such agreements include Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) which provide guarantees on the conditions of investment in Member States and in third countries, in the form of specific commitments that are binding under international law. Although agreements remain binding on the Member States as a matter of public international law, in the light of the entry into force of the TFEU the existence of Member States' agreements relating to investment should be addressed from the perspective of the EU's exclusive competence on foreign direct investment. In the absence of an explicit transitional regime in the TFEU clarifying the status of Member States' agreements, this proposal will authorise the continued existence of all investment agreements currently in force between Member States and third countries. LEGAL BASE : Article 207(2) TFEU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission evaluated a number of options without carrying out a formal impact assessment. The proposal stresses the importance of legal certainty and notes that soft-law instruments, such as a declaration or statement by the Commission services or by the College on the validity of bilateral investment agreements, would not establish the legal certainty that is required to guarantee the agreements concerned. CONTENT : the draft Regulation provides for an explicit guarantee of legal certainty as regards the conditions under which investors operate. In recognition of the fact that Member States may be required to amend investment agreements, in particular to bring them in compliance with Treaty obligations, the proposal also establishes a framework to empower Member States to enter into negotiations with a third country with a view to modifying an existing bilateral agreement relating to investment. This framework is also available to Member States to negotiate, under certain conditions, a new bilateral agreement with third countries relating to investment. Given that the EU is exclusively competent for foreign direct investment, and that an EU investment policy will be gradually developed, the procedure established by this proposal must be regarded as an exceptional transitional measure. Objective : this is to authorise the continuation in force of international agreements relating to investment concluded between Member States and third countries and to establish conditions and a procedural framework for the negotiation and conclusion by Member States of such agreements. Chapter I sets out the subject matter and scope of the Regulation. Chapter II provides for authorisation for existing bilateral agreements that Member States have concluded with third countries to remain in force. The provisions: require Member States to notify to the Commission of all agreements that they wish to maintain, including agreements which have been concluded but not entered into force; authorise the maintenance in force of all existing agreements between Member States and third countries relating to investment that have been notified by Member States, starting upon the entry into force of this Regulation; provide for the annual publication of all notified agreements in the Official Journal, to ensure that the exact scope of the legal coverage provided by the Regulation is known by all stakeholders; provides for the review of agreements which have been notified. The Commission will assess whether the agreements conflict with the law of the Union, undermine negotiations or agreements relating to investment between the Union and third countries, or undermine the Union's policies relating to investment, including in particular the common commercial policy. No later than five years after the entry into force of the Regulation, the Commission will present a report based on the review of the agreements and any possible recommendations to discontinue the application of the provisions of Chapter II or to modify these provisions; detail the possible withdrawal of the authorisation granted under this Chapter. A withdrawal of authorisation may be necessary for agreements with a given third country when (i) these agreements conflict with the law of the Union, or (ii) overlap with an agreement of the Union with that third country; or (iii) undermine the Union's policies relating to investment, including the common commercial policy (e.g. where the existence of agreements undermines the willingness of a third country to negotiate with the Union), or (iv) where the Council has not taken a decision on the authorisation to open negotiations concerning investment within one year of the submission of a recommendation by the Commission. Chapter III provides for the modification of existing agreements and the conclusion of new agreements. This Chapter: provides for the general framework under which Member States may conclude or modify bilateral agreements relating to investment; requires the notification to the Commission of a Member States' intent to modify an existing or to conclude a new bilateral agreement with a third country. Member States are requested to provide all relevant documentation relating to the re-negotiation or negotiation of an agreement, which can be made available to other Member States and the European Parliament subject to the requirements of confidentiality; details the substantive grounds on the basis of which the Commission would not authorise the opening of formal negotiations by Member States, which include notably the ground that a Member State initiative could undermine the objectives of EU negotiations or EU policy. The Commission may require a Member State to include in a negotiation appropriate clauses, for example with respect to (a) the termination of the agreement in the event of the conclusion of a subsequent agreement between the Union with the same third country (see for example the denunciation or replacement clauses in Regulation 662/2009); (b) transfer provisions or (c) most-favoured nation treatment with to ensure equal treatment of all EU investors in the relevant third country; requires that Member States keep the Commission informed of negotiations that have been authorised. In addition, the Commission may request to participate as an observer in the negotiations concerning investment between the Member State and the third country; provides for the procedure under which Member States can be authorised to sign and conclude an agreement; provides for the review of authorisations that would be made pursuant to Chapter III of the Regulation. Chapter IV sets out certain requirements regarding the conduct of Member States with regard to agreements covered by this Regulation. The Chapter: requests Member States provide information with respect to meetings which take place under the auspices of covered agreements, and to inform the Commission of any request for dispute settlement and to cooperate with the Commission as regards the activation of dispute; provides that Member States may indicate whether any of the information they provide is to be considered confidential and whether it can be shared with other Member States; creates a new committee which shall assist the Commission in the management of the Regulation and stipulates the procedures under which this committee shall operate. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : The proposal has no implication for the EU Budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the Union and the UK notified the other Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that their current market access level will be maintained but apportioned respectively between the Union and the United Kingdom. The methodology for this apportionment, as well as the new EU-27 volumes, are laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Paraguay has a tariff rate quota of 1 000 tonnes for high quality bovine meat (order number 094455), which is not included in the EU’s WTO schedule. This tariff rate quotas was erroneously included in the apportionment exercise and thus reduced to 711 tonnes on the EU-27 side without any corresponding volume being opened on the UK side. This means Paraguay’s market access has been reduced from 1 000 tonnes to 711 tonnes with application as of 1 January 2021. It is therefore appropriate to restore this tariff quota to its original volume. This initiative is in line with the EU’s ongoing actions to ensure that the consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU are dealt with in an orderly manner. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/216 in order to restore the correct volume (1000 tonnes) of tariff quota No 094455 for EU-27. The row relating to order number 094455 (High quality meat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen from Paraguay) would thus be deleted from the Annex, Part A of Regulation (EU) 2019/216."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the global economic and financial crisis revealed gaps and weaknesses in the existing instruments and methods of co-ordination and surveillance of economic policies in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). There is broad agreement that the framework for EMU should be urgently strengthened in order to anchor macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances. The key instrument for fiscal policy co-ordination and surveillance is the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which implements the Treaty provisions on budgetary discipline. Strengthening the Pact is important for both increasing the credibility of the agreed co-ordinated fiscal exit strategy and avoiding a repetition of past mistakes. This proposal is part of legislative package comprising six texts which seeks to strengthen the pact by improving its provisions in the light of experience, not least of the crisis: 1) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1466/97); 2) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1467/97); 3) A Regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area; 4) A new Council Directive on requirements for the budgetary framework of the Member States; 5) A new Regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; 6) A Regulation on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. The outlines of these proposals were announced by the Commission in two communications on economic governance: “Reinforcing economic policy coordination” (12 May 2010) and “Enhancing economic policy coordination for stability, growth and jobs – Tools for stronger EU economic governance” (30 June 2010). In June 2010, the European Council agreed on the urgent need to reinforce the coordination of economic policies. strengthening both the preventive and corrective parts of the SGP, including with sanctions and taking due account of the particular situation of euro-area Member States; giving, in budgetary surveillance, a much more prominent role to levels and evolutions of debt and overall sustainability; ensuring that all Member States have national budgetary rules and medium term budgetary frameworks in line with the SGP; ensuring the quality of statistical data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the changes that the Commission is proposing in regard to the preventive and corrective parts of the SGP need to be complemented by a new set of graduated financial sanctions for euro-area Member States to make the enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area more effective. 1) As regards the preventive part, the implementation mechanism would take the form of an interest-bearing deposit, amounting to 0.2% of GDP. A procedure of ‘reverse voting’ mechanism is introduced for imposing the interest-bearing deposit: on the issue of a recommendation, the deposit would become due on proposal by the Commission, unless the Council decides to the contrary by qualified majority within ten days. The Council could reduce the amount of the deposit only unanimously or based on a Commission proposal and a reasoned request from the Member State concerned. The deposit will be returned with the accrued interest once the Council is satisfied that the situation giving rise to it has come to an end. 2) As far as the corrective part is concerned, a non-interest-bearing deposit amounting to 0.2% of GDP would apply upon a decision to place a country in excessive deficit. This would be converted into a fine in the event of non-compliance with the initial recommendation to correct the deficit. Further non-compliance would result in the sanction being stepped up, in line with the already existing provisions in the SGP. To reduce discretion in enforcement, the ‘reverse voting’ mechanism is envisaged for imposing the new sanctions in connection with the successive steps of the EDP. Specifically, at each step of the EDP, the Commission will make a proposal for the relevant sanction, and this will be considered adopted, unless the Council decides to the contrary by qualified majority within ten days. The size of the non-interest-bearing deposit or the fine could only be reduced or cancelled by the Council unanimously or based on a specific proposal from the Commission on grounds of exceptional economic circumstances or following a reasoned request by the Member State concerned. The non-interest-bearing deposit should be released upon correction of the excessive deficit while the interest on such deposits and the fines collected should be distributed among Member States whose currency is the euro which do not have an excessive deficit and which are not the subject of an excessive imbalance procedure either.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) lays down rules for investment firms operating in EU financial markets. These rules determine how investment firms should interact with investors and how they should organise the trading venues. The rules on investment services have an important role to play in promoting the recapitalisation of European firms in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, formal burdens that are not strictly necessary should be removed. The Commission therefore strives to recalibrate investor protection requirements to strike the right balance between a sufficient level of transparency for the client, the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for firms. This legislative proposal amending MiFID II is part of a set of measures to facilitate the economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, which includes also legislative proposals amending the Prospectus Regulation the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, for a streamlined application of the regulatory requirements, keeping high safeguards for retail clients while allowing for more flexibility for wholesale clients and ensures that fully functioning commodity markets can play their important role in the recovery of EU economies. This legislative proposal also aims to complement the objectives of the Capital Markets Union to diversify market-based sources of financing for European companies and facilitate cross-border investments. Amendments to information requirements The changes to the current regime provide a precise calibration of the rules applicable to retail clients, professional customers and eligible counterparties. The majority of the proposed changes shall consist of relief for professional clients and eligible counterparties, namely: - the phasing out of paper-based default method: documents shall be provided in electronic format. However, retail clients may opt-in to paper based information; - as regards the indication of costs and charges, the introduction of an exemption for eligible counterparties and professional clients for services other than investment advice and portfolio management. In addition, in case of distance communication all clients using all services shall be able, under certain conditions, to receive costs and charges information just after the transaction; - lighter ex-post reporting obligations: these reports shall no longer apply in respect of eligible counterparties; professional clients shall be able to choose whether or not to receive them; - the temporary suspension of best execution reporting; - the waiver by professional investors of cost-benefit analysis in the event of a change of product during the course of the relationship; - the lifting of the product governance requirements for simple corporate bonds with make-whole clauses (which are investor-protective features). The aim of this exemption is to make more plain vanilla corporate bonds available to retail investors. Measures affecting energy derivatives markets The proposal introduces changes to the regime applicable to commodities with a view to enabling businesses in the real economy to cope with market volatility, while at the same time allowing the emergence of new commodity contracts, which is also important for promoting the international role of the euro. The proposed amendments recalibrate precisely the position limit regime and the scope of the hedging exemption. They shall not concern agricultural commodities, in particular products for human consumption."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: building trust in the online environment is key to economic development. The existing EU legislation, namely Directive 1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures, essentially covers electronic signatures only. There is no comprehensive EU cross-border and cross-sector framework for secure, trustworthy and easy-to-use electronic transactions that encompasses electronic identification, authentication and signatures. The Digital Agenda for Europe identifies existing barriers to Europe’s digital development and proposes legislation on e-signatures and the mutual recognition of eIdentification and authentication, establishing a clear legal framework so as to eliminate fragmentation and the lack of interoperability, enhance digital citizenship and prevent cybercrime. Legislation ensuring the mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication across the EU is also a key action in the Single Market Act, as well as the Roadmap for Stability and Growth. The European Parliament stressed the importance of the security of electronic services, especially of electronic signatures, and of the need to create a public key infrastructure at pan-European level, and called on the Commission to set up a European validation authorities gateway to ensure the cross-border interoperability of electronic signatures and to increase the security of transactions carried out using the internet. The aim of this proposal is to enhance existing legislation and to expand it to cover the mutual recognition and acceptance at EU level of notified electronic identification schemes and other essential related electronic trust services. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three sets of policy options were assessed, dealing respectively with (1) the scope of the new framework, (2) the legal instrument and (3) the level of supervision required. The preferred policy option proved to be enhancing legal certainty, boosting coordination of national supervision, ensuring mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification schemes and incorporating essential related trust services. The impact assessment concluded that doing this would lead to considerable improvements to legal certainty, security and trust in terms of cross-border electronic transactions, resulting in less fragmentation of the market. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed regulation seeks to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of public and private online services, e-business and electronic commerce in the EU. The main points of the proposal are as follows: 1) Electronic identification : the proposal provides for the mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification means falling under a scheme, which will be notified, to the Commission on the conditions laid down in the Regulation. It does not oblige Member States to introduce or notify electronic identification schemes, but to recognise and accept notified electronic identifications for those online services where electronic identification is required to get access at national level. Electronic identification schemes shall be eligible for notification if all five of the following conditions are met: ·  the electronic identification means are issued by, on behalf of or under the responsibility of the notifying Member State; ·  the electronic identification means can be used to access at least public services requiring electronic identification in the notifying Member State; ·  Member States must ensure an unambiguous link between the electronic identification data and the person concerned; ·  the notifying Member State ensures the availability of an authentication possibility online, at any time and free of charge. No specific technical requirements, such as hardware or software can be imposed on the parties relying on such authentication; ·  Member States must accept liability for the unambiguity of the link (i.e. that the identification data attributed to the person are not linked to any other person) and the authentication possibility (i.e. the possibility to check the validity of the electronic identification data). The proposal also aims to ensure the technical interoperability of the notified identification schemes through a coordination approach, including delegated acts. 2) Trust services : the proposal sets out the principles relating to the liability of both non-qualified and qualified trust service providers. It builds on Directive 1999/93/EC and extends entitlement to compensation of damage caused by any negligent trust service provider for failure to comply with security good practices which result in a security breach which has a significant impact on the service. It also describes the mechanism for the recognition and acceptance of qualified trust services provided by a provider established in a third country. 3) Supervision : the proposal (i) requires Member States to establish supervisory bodies, clarifying and enlarging the remit of the latter with regard to both trust service providers and qualified trust service providers; (ii) introduces an explicit mechanism of mutual assistance between supervisory bodies in Member States to facilitate the cross-border supervision of trust service providers; (iii) introduces an obligation for both qualified and non-qualified trust service providers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for the security of their activities ; (iv) sets out the conditions for the supervision of qualified trust service providers and qualified trust services provided by them ; (v) provides for the establishment of trusted lists containing information on qualified trust service providers who are subject to supervision and to the qualified services they offer. 4) Electronic signature : the proposal enshrines the rules related to the legal effect of natural persons’ electronic signatures, introducing an explicit obligation to give to qualified electronic signatures the same legal effect as handwritten signatures. Furthermore, Member States must ensure the cross-border acceptance of qualified electronic signatures, in the context of the provision of public services. The proposal also sets out: the requirements for qualified signature certificates and the requirements for qualified electronic signature creation devices; the conditions for qualified validation services, and the condition for the long-term preservation of qualified electronic signatures. 5) Electronic seals : the provisions concern the legal effect of electronic seals of legal persons. A specific legal presumption is bestowed on a qualified electronic seal which guarantees the origin and integrity of electronic documents to which it is linked. 6) Electronic time stamp : a specific legal presumption is bestowed on qualified electronic time stamps with regard to the certainty of the time. 7) Electronic documents : there is a specific legal presumption of the authenticity and integrity of any electronic document signed with a qualified electronic signature or bearing a qualified electronic seal. With regard to the acceptance of electronic documents, when an original document or a certified copy is required for the provision of a public service, at the least electronic documents issued by the persons who are competent to issue the relevant documents and that are considered to be originals or certified copies in accordance with national law of the Member State of origin, shall be accepted in other Member States without additional requirements. 8) Website authentication: the proposal ensures that the authenticity of a website with respect to the owner of the site will be guaranteed. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: EUR 9 408 million for the period 2014-2020 (human resources). The specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Commission. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the common and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Fund). This Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/2305 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the resources allocated for economic, social and territorial cohesion. The general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2018 amended the financial programming for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices and bringing the overall amount of commitment appropriations for the YEI for 2018 up to EUR 350 million in current prices. The amount of commitment appropriations for 2020 needs to be adjusted downwards accordingly to reflect the frontloading to 2018. CONTENT: this proposal is the result of the 2018 budgetary decision. It aims to adapt the amounts of resources available for the investment for growth and jobs goal and for the European territorial cooperation goal set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations reflected in Annex VI in order to reflect changes in the financial programming for the YEI. Under this amending proposal, the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for the budgetary commitments for the period 2014-2020 (expressed in 2011 prices), shall amount to EUR 329 982 345 366, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in Annex VI, of which: EUR 325 938 694 233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; EUR 4 043 651 133 represents a specific allocation for the YEI . It is also proposed to correct some errors with regard to the amounts and percentages concerning the resources for the investment for growth and jobs goal set out in Regulation (EU) 2017/2305, amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. Under the corrective measure, the resources earmarked for the investment for growth and employment goal would amount to 96.09 % of total resources (i.e. a total of EUR 317 073 545 392) and shall be distributed as follows: 51.52 % (a total of EUR 163 359 380 738) for less developed regions; 10.82 % (a total of EUR 34 319 221 039) for transition regions; 16.33 % (a total of EUR 51 773 321 432) for more developed regions; 20.89 % (a total of EUR 66 236 030 665) for Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund; 0.44 % (a total of EUR 1 385 591 518) as additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: through Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies, which entered into full application on 7 December 2010, credit rating agencies (CRAs) are required to comply with rigorous rules of conduct in order to mitigate possible conflicts of interest, ensure high quality and sufficient transparency of ratings and the rating process. An amendment to Regulation (EU) No 513/2011 entrusted the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with exclusive supervisory powers over the registration and supervision of CRAs. Whilst providing a good basis, a number of issues related to credit rating activities and the use of ratings have not been sufficiently addressed in the existing CRA Regulation. These relate notably to: (i) the risk of overreliance on credit ratings by financial market participants, (ii) the high degree of concentration in the rating market, (iii) civil liability of credit rating agencies vis-à-vis investors, (iv) conflicts of interests with regard to the issuer-pays model and CRAs' shareholder structure. The specifics of sovereign ratings which became evident during the current sovereign debt crisis are also not specifically addressed in the current CRA Regulation. The Commission pointed to these open issues in its Communication of 2 June 2010 entitled ""Regulating financial services for sustainable growth"". On 8 June 2011, the European Parliament adopted a non-legislative resolution supporting the need to enhance the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies. The European Council of 23 October 2011 concluded that progress is needed on reducing overreliance on credit ratings. At the international level , in October 2010 the Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued principles to reduce authorities’ and financial institutions’ reliance on CRA ratings. Those principles were endorsed by the G20 Seoul Summit in November 2010. Lastly, the Commission recently addressed the question of overreliance on ratings by financial institutions in the context of the reform of the banking legislation. It proposed a similar provision in the draft amendment to the Directives on UCITS and on managers of alternative investment funds, which are presented in parallel to this proposal for a Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : different policy options were considered in order to address the problems identified and thus reach the corresponding specific objectives: · to diminish the impact of ""cliff"" effects on financial institutions and markets by reducing reliance on external ratings; · to mitigate the risks of contagion effects linked to sovereign ratings changes; · to improve credit rating market conditions with a view to improving the quality of ratings; · to ensure a right of redress for investors who have suffered losses due to a credit rating issued by a CRA that has infringed the CRA Regulation; and · to improve the quality of ratings by reinforcing the independence of CRAs and promoting sound credit rating processes and methodologies. Amongst the preferred policy options are the following: (i) reduction of overreliance by financial institutions on external ratings by reducing the importance of external ratings in financial services legislation; (ii) issuers' disclosure regarding the underlying asset pools of structured finance products to help investors to make their own credit risk assessment; (iii) quality of sovereign ratings to be improved through verification of underlying information and publication of the full research report accompanying the rating; (iv) comparison of ratings from distinct rating agencies, facilitated by promoting common standards for rating scales and a European Rating Index (EURIX), to improve choice; (v) mandatory rotation of CRAs; (vi) setting up a right of redress for investors against CRAs; (vii) strengthening the rules on the disclosure of rating methodologies. Lastly, there would be additional costs for financial firms resulting from the requirements to enhance internal risk management and the use of internal rating models for regulatory purposes and for issuers due to enhanced disclosure requirements. CRAs will also incur additional recurring compliance costs to mitigate risks of contagion effects linked to sovereign ratings. Neither the measures to improve competition nor the preferred options dealing with CRA independence would entail any significant costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation No 1060/2009 on credit ratings agencies. 1) Use of credit ratings: the proposal requires certain financial institutions to make their own credit risk assessment. They should therefore avoid relying solely or mechanistically on external credit ratings for assessing the creditworthiness of assets. Furthermore, ESMA, EBA and EIOPA should not refer to credit ratings in their guidelines, recommendations and draft technical standards where such references have the potential to trigger mechanistic reliance on credit ratings by competent authorities or financial market participants. · Issuers are obliged to disclose specific information on structured finance products on a continuing basis, in particular on the main elements of underlying asset pools for structured finance products necessary for investors to make their own credit assessment and thus avoid the need to rely on external ratings. This information is to be disclosed through a centralised website operated by ESMA. · Issuers (or their related third parties) who solicit a rating must engage two credit rating agencies, independent from each other, to issue two independent credit ratings in parallel on the same structured finance instruments. 2) Independence of credit ratings agencies : this group of amendments establishes stricter rules on independence which aim to address conflicts of interests with regard to the issuer-pays model and CRAs' shareholder structure: · The proposal prevents any member or shareholder of a CRA that holds a participation of at least 5% to hold 5% or more in any other CRA, unless the CRAs in question are members of the same group; · A new article introduces a rotation rule for the CRAs engaged by the issuer to either rate the issuer itself or its debt instruments. The CRA engaged should not be in place for more than 3 years or for more than 1 year if it rates more than ten consecutively rated debt instruments of the issuer. This rotation rule is expected significantly to mitigate the potential conflicts of interest issues relating to the issuer-pays model. Moreover, the Commission will continue to monitor the appropriateness of credit rating agencies' remuneration models and will submit a report thereon to the European Parliament and the Council by 7 December 2012. 3) Disclosure of information on methodologies of CRAs, credit ratings and rating outlooks: this group of amendments strengthens the rules on the disclosure of rating methodologies, with a view to promoting sound credit rating processes and, in fine, improve rating quality. · New provisions lay down procedures for the preparation of new rating methodologies or the modification of existing ones. They require the consultation of stakeholders on the new methodologies or the proposed changes and on their justification. Furthermore CRAs should submit the proposed methodologies to ESMA for the assessment of their compliance with existing requirements. · Each CRA will be obliged to correct errors in its methodologies or in their application, as well as to inform ESMA, the rated entities and generally the public of such errors. 4) Sovereign ratings: rules applying specifically to sovereign ratings (the rating of a State, a regional or local authority of a State or of an instrument for which the issuer of the debt or financial obligation is a State or a regional or local authority of a State) are particularly reinforced: · CRAs are required to assess sovereign ratings more frequently (every six months instead of every twelve months); · CRAs must publish a full research report when issuing and amending sovereign ratings, in order to improve transparency and enhance users’ understanding. Sovereign ratings should only be published after the close of business and at least one hour before the opening of trading venues in the EU; · CRAs must be transparent as to the allocation of staff to the ratings of different asset classes (i.e. corporate, structured finance, sovereign ratings). 5) Comparability of credit ratings: these amendments promote the comparability of credit ratings and provide for more transparency on fees charged for credit ratings. · CRAs must communicate their ratings to ESMA, which would ensure that all available ratings for a debt instrument are published in the form of a European Rating Index (EURIX), freely available to investors; · ESMA is empowered to develop draft technical standards, for endorsement by the Commission, on a harmonised rating scale to be used by CRAs. All ratings would need to follow the same scale standards, ensuring that investors can compare ratings more easily. · fees charged by CRAs to their clients for the provision of ratings (and ancillary services) should be non-discriminatory (i.e. based on actual cost and the transparency pricing criteria) and not based on any form of contingency (i.e. not depend on the result or outcome of the work performed). · CRAs must annually disclose to ESMA a list of fees charged to each client, for individual ratings and any ancillary service. · ESMA must undertake some monitoring activities regarding market concentration and the Commission will prepare a report on this issue. 6) Civil liability of credit rating agencies vis-à-vis investors: CRAs will bear such liability where they infringe, intentionally or with gross negligence, the CRA Regulation, thereby causing damage to an investor having relied on a credit rating of such CRA, provided the infringement in question affected the credit rating. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission's proposal has no impact on the European Union budget. In particular, tasks that would be entrusted to ESMA would not entail additional EU funding. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition . With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with Brazil were successfully finalised on 31 October 2017 by the initialling of the agreements amending the two Agreements between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports, and for holders of ordinary passports. Both parties have agreed to adopt the new definition of 'short-stay', among other technical details, but all amendments are insignificant from the traveller's point of view. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports . The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay : the Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Brazil when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). An amendment has been made clarifying that a suspension of the visa waiver shall actually be lifted if the reasons that led to the suspension disappear. On this point, the amendment aligns the wording of the agreement with Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports with that of all other visa waiver agreements signed by the Union in 2015 and 2016. Entry into force : the Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the 6th month following the date on which the last Contracting Party notifies the other that the ratification procedures have been completed. To ensure legal certainty and enable travellers to comprehend the law and to comply with it, a sufficiently long transitional period is necessary. Once ratification of the Agreement has been completed, the six-month period will allow travellers to complete short stays that are still entirely calculated under the old definition, before entry into force of the new short-stay definition and its 180-day backward-looking reference period. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports remain unaffected by the Agreement, including the territorial scope. Territorial application : the provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. The Union has no power to amend visa waiver agreements that would bind the four countries that are associated with the implementation of the Schengen acquis, including the common visa policy. In order to ensure a harmonised approach and implementation of the provisions on the duration of authorised stay in the Schengen area, a joint declaration is included in the Agreement, stating the desirability for Brazil, on the one hand, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, on the other, to accordingly modify their existing bilateral visa waiver agreements."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in Southeast Asia was signed on 24 February 1976 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Since this date, a number of Southeast Asian countries have been contracted to this Treaty in addition to the United States of America, Turkey and Canada. The Treaty aims to promote peace, stability and co-operation in the region. To this end, it calls for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of security in Southeast Asia. Hence, the rules and principles set out in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation correspond to the objectives of the Union’s common foreign and security polity. The Council, at its meeting on 4-5 December 2006, authorised the Presidency and the Commission to negotiate the European Union’s and the European Community’s accessions to the TAC. By letter of 7 December 2006, the European Union and the European Community have informed Cambodia, in its capacity of ASEAN Co-ordinator for relations with the EU, of its decision to apply for accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia subject to the understandings expressed in the letter. On 28 May 2009, Thailand, then Chair of ASEAN, declared the consent of all the States in Southeast Asia to the accession to the Treaty by the European Union and the European Community, subject to the entry into force of the Third Protocol to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. On 23 July 2010, this Third Protocol to the Treaty was signed which allows for the accession of regional organisations to the said Treaty. The European Union should therefore accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 37 TEU and Articles 209 and 211 TFEU in conjunction with Article 31(1) TEU and Article 218(6)(a) and (8), the second subparagraph of the TFEU. CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, it is proposed that the European Union accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. The purpose of this Treaty is to promote perpetual peace, everlasting amity and cooperation in Southeast Asia. Principles : in their relations with one another, the High Contracting Parties shall be guided by the following fundamental principles: (i) mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and national identity of all nations; (ii) the right of every State to lead its national existence free from external interference, subversion or coersion; (iii) non-interference in the internal affairs of one another; (iv) settlement of differences or disputes by peaceful means; (v) renunciation of the threat or use of force; (vi) effective cooperation among themselves. Cooperation : Parties shall promote active cooperation in the economic, social, technical, scientific and administrative fields as well as in matters of common ideals and aspirations of international peace and stability in the region and all other matters of common interest. Parties shall collaborate for the acceleration of the economic growth in the region in order to strengthen the foundation for a prosperous and peaceful community of nations in Southeast Asia. To this end, they shall promote the greater utilization of their agriculture and industries, the expansion of their trade and the improvement of their economic infrastructure for the mutual benefit of their peoples. In this regard, they shall continue to explore all avenues for close and beneficial cooperation with other States as well as international and regional organisations outside the region. Parties, in order to achieve social justice and to raise the standards of living of the peoples of the region, shall intensify economic cooperation. Other provisions : the Treaty also provides provisions are regards: the settlement of disputes; the procedure as regards the entry into force, the implementation and the application of the Treaty.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is a global leader in environmental protection and climate action. The Commission considers the shift towards a clean, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy to be a priority. The programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE), established by Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 for the period 2014 to 2020, is the latest in a series of Union programmes over 25 years which support the implementation of environmental and climate legislation and policy priorities. Through its catalytic role, the programme supports small scale actions intended to initiate, expand or promote sustainable production, distribution and consumption practices, as well as to protect natural heritage. The Commission considers that this approach should be continued in the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. An enhanced LIFE programme would play an important role in developing climate action and clean energy investments across Europe. It would also help the EU meet its climate objectives and commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN’s sustainable development goals. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the environment and climate action programme (LIFE). It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, as well as the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Programme objectives : the proposed programme aims to achieve the Union’s objectives as set out in international environmental, climate and clean energy legislation, policy, plans and commitments. Its overall objective is to contribute to the shift towards: a clean, circular, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, including a transition to clean energy; protecting and improving the quality of the environment; halting and reversing biodiversity loss, including in marine ecosystems, so as to contribute to sustainable development. In particular, the new LIFE programme shall: mobilise investment and support energy efficiency activities, particularly in European regions lagging behind in the shift towards clean energy; support projects promoting best practice in relation to nature protection and biodiversity, as well as ‘strategic nature protection projects’ for all Member States, including measures to protect the marine environment; contribute to the transition to a circular economy model through financial support targeting a variety of actors (businesses, public authorities and consumers), in particular by applying, developing, and replicating best technology, practices and solutions tailored to specific local, regional or national contexts, including through integrated approaches for the implementation of waste management and prevention plans; support the other aspects of the Union's environment policy, such as the protection and improvement of air and water quality in the EU, implementing the 2030 climate and energy policy framework and meeting the Union’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. Actions taken under the programme are expected to contribute 61 % of the overall financial envelope of the programme to climate objectives. The Commission proposes to simplify the programme management procedures and allow for a wider geographical access. Synergies would be developed with the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, Horizon Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility and InvestEU. Proposed budget : EUR 5.45 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027. The indicative breakdown of this amount is as follows: Environment : EUR 3.5 billion of which: (i) EUR 2.15 billion for the Nature and Biodiversity sub-programme; (ii) EUR 1.35 billion for the Circular Economy and Quality of Life sub-programme; Climate action : EUR 1.95 billion of which: (i) EUR 950 million for the sub-programme Climate change mitigation and adaptation; (ii) EUR 1 billion for the sub-programme clean energy transition."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement of 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on statistics of goods transport by inland waterways and repealing Council Directive 80/1119/EEC. The proposed new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The main elements of the proposed codified text are as follows: Subject matter : the proposal establishes common rules for the production of European statistics concerning inland waterways transport. It shall enable the Commission to have statistics concerning the transport of goods by inland waterways in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy, as well as the transport elements of policies on the regions and on trans-European networks. Scope : Member States in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1 000 000 tonnes shall supply the data in accordance with the tables in Annexes I to IV to the Regulation. The effect of this Regulation is limited to those Member States where inland waterway transport exists. Pilot studies : the Commission shall ensure that pilot studies are carried out on the availability of statistical data on passenger transport by inland waterways, including cross-border transport services. The Union shall contribute to the cost of implementing these pilot studies. Implementation : the Commission may adopt: implementing acts on data transmission procedures and developing and publishing criteria and methodological requirements to ensure the quality of the data produced; delegated acts to amend the Regulation on increasing the threshold of 1 million tonnes of statistical coverage of inland waterway transport, to adapt the definitions and to adapt the Annexes in order to take account of economic and technical changes affecting definitions adopted at international level."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Article 19 of the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA Agreement) contains provisions on trade in agricultural products. The 2007 EU-Iceland bilateral Agreement on trade preferences includes, among others, a commitment by the Parties to promote trade in products with geographical indications (GIs). The EU-Iceland GIs negotiations were conducted from 4 July 2012 to 17 September 2015. The negotiations were carried out in conjunction with the EU-Iceland negotiations on further liberalisation of trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products. The conclusion of the GIs Agreement with Iceland fits into the overall EU strategy of promoting the production and the consumption of EU products with GIs. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council adopt a decision, approving on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs. Under this Agreement, 1 150 EU foodstuff GIs will obtain a high level of direct protection in Iceland. The GIs will be protected against: Iceland has not yet registered any protected GI names. The Agreement provides, however, a mechanism for updating the GIs list and for including new GI names at a later stage through a Joint Committee process The EEA Agreement already provides for the mutual recognition and protection of geographical indications for wines, aromatised wine products and spirit drinks. Therefore the scope of this Agreement covers only agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines, aromatised wine products and spirit drinks. The GIs Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties have notified each other that their respective internal adoption procedures have been completed."
2406EP7,"""""Right to information in criminal proceedings""""",0.895,0.945,0.93,0.419,0.303,0.916,0.897,0.771,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to set common minimum standards as regards the right to information in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is the second step in a series of measures in the Procedural Rights Roadmap, adopted in Council on 30 November 2009 inviting the Commission to put forward proposals on a step by step basis. It should therefore be considered as part of a comprehensive package of legislation to be presented over the next few years which will provide a minimum set of procedural rights in criminal proceedings in the European Union. The first step, on the right to interpretation and translation, is a Directive adopted on 8 October 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to improve the rights of suspects. Having common minimum standards in relation to these rights should facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition, thereby improving the functioning of judicial cooperation between Member States of the EU. The main points are as follows: Objective: the Directive lays down rules concerning the right of suspected and accused persons to information about their rights and about the charge in criminal proceedings against them. Scope: the Directive applies from the time that a person is made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State, by official notification or otherwise, that he is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings (including any appeal). It does not, however, apply in proceedings conducted by administrative authorities in relation to the breach of competition legislation, whether national or European, unless the case is brought before a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters. European Arrest Warrant proceedings are explicitly covered. In this respect, the Directive makes applicable the procedural guarantees contained in Articles 47 and 48 of the Charter and Articles 5 and 6 ECHR to surrender proceedings based on a European Arrest Warrant. Right to information about rights : the proposal lays down the general principle that all suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings should be informed about relevant procedural rights at the earliest possible moment in the proceedings. Such information should be given in simple and accessible language, orally or in writing. The proposal also sets out those minimum rights and Member States' obligations arising from the Charter, the ECHR, the ICCPR and applicable EU legislation, which are considered key to safeguarding the fairness of criminal proceedings at their outset. Right to written information about rights on arrest : the draft directive specifies Member States' general duty to inform suspected or accused persons about their procedural rights in cases where such persons are deprived of their liberty by Member States' competent authorities in the course of the criminal proceedings on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence (e.g. through arrest by the police and being placed in pre-trial detention on the order of a judge). Member States are required to inform these persons of their relevant rights in writing. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), has repeatedly stressed in its reports that, in its experience, the period immediately following deprivation of liberty is when the arrested person is considered to be most vulnerable in relation to risks of intimidation and physical ill-treatment. According to the CPT it is essential that a suspected or accused person is informed of his rights promptly, i.e. without delay after his arrest and in the most effective way which is by means of a form explaining the rights in a straightforward manner (Letter of Rights). In the light of recent European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence, Member States' competent authorities are required to ensure that the arrested person has a broad understanding of the information contained in the Letter of Rights. The arrested person must be allowed to keep the Letter of Rights throughout the time of his detention. The Letter of Rights should be drafted in language which is easily understood by a lay person without any knowledge of criminal procedure and should contain the information referred to in the draft directive. To promote consistency in the written information throughout the EU, Annex I to the Directive contains a model of the Letter of Rights which Member States may use. This model is indicative and may be subject to review in the context of the report on implementation to be presented by the Commission and also once all the Roadmap measures have come into force. The content of the model does not prejudice rights that currently apply in Member States. The Letter of Rights has to be provided to the suspected or accused person in a language he understands. Police authorities are expected to keep language versions for all commonly spoken languages in their locality available in electronic form that can be printed as the need arises. When a given language version is not available, the suspected or accused person should be informed of their rights orally in a language they understand and the Letter of Rights should be given to them without undue delay (i.e. as soon as it becomes available after translation into the relevant language). For persons who are partially sighted or blind, or who cannot read, Member States must have a method of transmitting the information. The right to written information about rights in European Arrest Warrant proceedings : different rights apply to persons subject to a European Arrest Warrant (e.g. the right to a hearing). Member States should ensure that a specific version of the Letter of Rights exists for persons subject to those proceedings. Annex II to the Directive contains a model of the Letter of Rights which Member States may use. This model is indicative and may be subject to review. The content of the model does not prejudice rights that currently apply in Member States. The right to information about the charge : once a person has been charged with a criminal offence, he should be given sufficient information promptly, in detail and in a language he understands, to enable him to prepare his defence, and to challenge pre-trial decisions if necessary. This is a requirement under the Charter and the ECHR. The text sets out exactly what information must be given as a minimum requirement. The right to access to the case-file : the most effective way to provide a suspected or accused person with detailed information about the charge in order to allow him adequately to prepare his defence at trial is to give him or his lawyer access to the case-file. Recent research shows that in the large majority of Member States access to the case-file is already granted at some point in the criminal proceedings. The ECtHR has consistently ruled that, depending on the stage of criminal proceedings, Member States are required to disclose to the defence all material evidence for or against the accused and to provide the accused person's lawyer with access to relevant documents contained in the case-file. The draft directive provides that where a suspected or accused person is arrested in the course of criminal proceedings, access to those documents contained in the case-file which are relevant to the determination of the lawfulness of the detention by the competent judicial authority should be granted. This limited access to the case-file ensures the fairness of pre-trial proceedings concerning the lawfulness of arrest and detention. In considering what documents and information access is being granted to, Member States should pay particular attention to the protection of the effectiveness of Leniency Programmes that are used in investigations under criminal law into cartel behaviour. The text requires Member States to grant access to the case-file to all accused persons whether or not they are in custody, where the criminal investigation is concluded. Access to certain documents in the case-file may be excluded by a competent judicial authority where access to those documents may lead to serious risk to the life of another person or may seriously harm the internal security of the Member State in which the proceedings are taking place. Such limitation of access to the file is only to be used in exceptional circumstances. Access to the case-file should not be limited to a one-off inspection. If the accused person or his lawyer deems it necessary, further access should be granted. If a file is particularly voluminous or where the interests of justice so require it, the accused person should be provided with an index of the documents contained in the case-file to enable him to decide to which documents he wishes to be given access. Verification and remedies : in order to ensure that a suspected or accused person receives all the information to which he is entitled, Member States should establish a procedure to ascertain whether the person has received the information. This can be a form for the person to sign confirming that he has received the information or a note in the custody record. Training: Member States' police officers, prosecutors and judges should receive the necessary training to discharge adequately their duties arising from the directive. In particular, it is imperative that these officials have the requisite detailed knowledge of the procedural rights of suspected and accused persons in order to provide relevant and practically effective information on these rights. Non-regression clause : the aim is to ensure that setting common minimum standards in accordance with the Directive does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the standards set in the ECHR are maintained. Member States remain entirely free to set standards higher than those agreed in the Directive. Report: this must be submitted by the Commission 36 months after publication of the Directive. Annex I: this Annex contains an indicative model of the Letter of Rights to be provided to a suspected or accused person on arrest. The model Letter of Rights sets out an explanation in simple language of the immediately relevant minimum rights as listed in the Directive. Whilst there is no obligation on Member States to use the model, those that do will be presumed to have implemented the relevant article 4 of the Directive. Annex II: this Annex contains an indicative model of the Letter of Rights to be provided to a person arrested on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant. Whilst there is no obligation on Member States to use the model, those that do will be presumed to have implemented the relevant article of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."
3297EP7,"""""Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items""""",0.754,0.846,0.0,0.613,0.182,0.843,0.046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items by introducing delegated acts in order to update Annex I of the Regulation. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 requires dual-use items to be subject to effective control when they are exported from or transit through the EU, or are delivered to a third country as a result of brokering services provided by a broker resident or established in the EU. Annex I to the Regulation : this establishes the common list of dual-use items that are subject to controls in the EU. Decisions on the items subject to controls are taken within the framework of the Australia Group (AG), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The Regulation provides for Annex I to be updated in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any modification thereof, that Member States have accepted as members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties. The international export control regimes take control list decisions approximately 4 times per year. These updates need to be integrated into EU legislation on a regular and timely basis due to their security and trade implications. Currently, any update of Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 including of Annex I requires the use of the ordinary legislative procedure. At the same time, given the technical nature of these amendments and the fact that these changes need to be in conformity with decisions taken in the international export control regimes, there is little margin for manoeuvre for introducing modifications to the amendments agreed in the regimes. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce delegated acts in order to update Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 on a regular basis. This approach would allow the Commission to make the necessary updates as and when required. Annex II : Annex II sets out the EU General Export Authorisations currently in force in the EU. The Commission proposed in December 2008 to introduce six new EU General Export Authorisations. An agreement concerning these new Authorisations was reached in mid-2011. The contents of existing and future EU General Export Authorisations need to be continuously monitored in order to ensure that only low-risk transactions are covered by the Authorisations. Given the fast pace of developments around the world, there is a need to ensure that existing EU General Export Authorisations can be modified rapidly as regards their destination and item scopes, so that changing global circumstances can be properly reflected in the EU export control system. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce delegated acts in order to allow the Commission to rapidly remove destinations and/or items from the scope of existing EU General Export Authorisations. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 TFEU. CONTENT : the proposal introduces the following provisions : ·  it empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts concerning the removal of destinations and items from the scope of EU General Export Authorisations included in Annex II. It also makes provision for an urgent procedure where, in the case of a significant change of circumstances as regards the assessment of the sensitivity of exports under an EU General Export Authorisation included in Annex II, imperative grounds of urgency require a removal of particular destinations and/or items from the scope of an EU General Export Authorisation; ·  it empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts concerning updating the list of dual-use items set out in Annex, within the scope set out in the text. The delegation of power shall be conferred for an indeterminate period of time and may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A delegated act adopted shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of 2 months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by 2 months at the initiative of the European Parliament or the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not entail any additional cost for the EU budget."
5698EP7,"""""Explosives for civil uses""""",0.895,0.886,0.912,0.645,0.424,0.892,0.872,0.8,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to align Directive 93/15/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses with the new legislative framework, in particular to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (Goods Package). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Council Directive 93/15/EEC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The proposal does not change the scope of Council Directive 93/15/EEC and the essential safety requirements. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the pyrotechnic articles are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the article bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 93/15/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 93/15/EC on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their pyrotechnic articles comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant article is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Republic of Korea is a country with capabilities in the space technology and applications. It is an active user of satellite navigation services in various sectors including transport, fleet management, science and geodesy. The European Commission negotiated a Cooperation agreement on a Civil Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Korea, of the other part. The Agreement was then signed on 9 September 2006. The signatory Member States of the European Union and Korea have completed their procedures related to the entry into force of the Agreement.

The text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision. This Agreement seeks to encourage, facilitate and enhance cooperation between the Parties in civil global satellite navigation. The sectors for cooperation activities in satellite navigation and timing are: The Parties may adapt this list by decision of the GNSS Steering Committee established under the Agreement. The present Agreement does not include, inter alia: (i) Galileo sensitive technologies and items under export control and non-proliferation regulatory measures applicable in the European Community or its Member States; (ii) Galileo System Security Architecture (space, ground and user segments); (iii) exchange of classified information concerning satellite navigation and Galileo. This Agreement shall not affect: (i) the institutional structure established by the European Community law for the purpose of the operations of the Galileo programme; (ii) the applicable regulatory measures implementing non-proliferation and export control commitments, including control of intangible transfers of technology, nor does it affect national security measures. The Agreement also includes measures concerning the exchange of classified information concerning satellite navigation and Galileo, consultation and dispute resolution."
1962EP7,"""""Tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme""""",0.825,0.832,0.018,0.645,0.303,0.795,0.159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market for tractors while protecting human health and the environment. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/25/EC on action to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by engines intended to power agricultural and forestry tractors. The current stage of emission limits applicable for type approval of the majority of compression ignition engines is referred to as Stage III A. The directive provides that those limits will be replaced by the more stringent Stage III B limits, entering into force progressively as of 1 January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market and from 1 January 2010 as regards the type approval for those engines. T he transition to Stage III B involves a step change in technology requiring significant implementation costs for re-designing the engines and for developing advanced technical solutions. This transition stipulated by the legislator in 2005 coincides with the economic recession in the sector concerned which makes it difficult for the industry to bear the implementation costs necessary in order to adapt to the new legal requirements. Directive 2000/25/EC provides for a flexibility scheme to allow tractor manufacturers to purchase, in the period between two emission stages, a limited quantity of engines that do not comply with the current emission limit values, but are approved to the nearest previous stage of emission limits. In order to provide a temporary relief to industry when moving to the next stage, it is necessary to adapt the conditions for applying the flexibility scheme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal takes into account a Technical Review of the Directive 97/68/EC by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) which includes, inter alia, an evaluation of the need to amend the provisions of the flexibility scheme; an Impact Assessment study by an external consultant to assess the impacts of the proposed policy options as laid down in the draft Technical Review of JRC, and a complementary study on the impacts of the options of the Technical Review of JRC, including consequences of an amendment of the flexibility scheme for SMEs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal addresses the situation that manufacturers face difficulties to get Stage III B compliant engines approved and place them on the market due to delays in the design of new engines and the unexpected financial crisis. It is proposed to modify the provisions of the flexibility scheme to mitigate the effects from the transition of emission Stages III A to III B by extending its application while maintaining the entry into force of the exhaust emission limit Stage III B to preserve the objective of the Directive to reduce emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants in the European Union. More specifically, the aim of this Directive is to amend Directive 2000/25/EC as follows: an increase of the percentage of the number of engines placed on the market under the flexibility scheme in each engine category from 20% to 50% of the tractor manufacturer’s annual sales of equipment and an adaptation of the maximum number of engines that may be placed on the market under the flexibility scheme as an optional alternative, in the period between emission Stage III A to emission Stage III B. This measure will expire on 31 December 2013. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: This proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 allows Member States to compensate 36 enumerated railway undertakings for the payment of obligations which undertakings of other transport modes do not have to support, such as special family allowances and pensions. When the rules for normalisation are correctly applied, such State support is considered compatible with the internal market and Member States are exempted from State aid notification obligations, Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 was adopted before the rail market was liberalised and when rail transport in Europe was developing primarily within national borders, with integrated companies both operating rail services and managing rail infrastructure. Today, this Regulation is inconsistent and incompatible with legislative measures currently in force, as well as with the fundamental principles laid down in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a single European railway area which include that: (i) railway undertakings shall be managed according to principles that apply to commercial companies; (ii) entities responsible for the allocation of capacity and charging for rail infrastructure shall be separate from entities which operate rail services; (iii) there shall be a separation of accounts; (iv) any railway undertaking licensed in accordance with EU criteria should have access to railway infrastructure on fair, non-discriminatory terms; and (v) that infrastructure managers may benefit from State financing. Regulation (EEC) In the context of a liberalised market where railway undertakings compete directly with the traditional monopolies listed in the Regulation, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to discriminate between these two groups of undertakings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. However, it requested information from Member States about application of the Regulation in May 2010 and in June 2011. Responses revealed that, between 2007 and 2010, a majority of Member States had not received applications from railway undertakings and had not made payments of compensation under the Regulation. A majority of Member States indicated they saw no ongoing need for the Regulation and some explicitly expressed their support for repeal or their opinion that the Regulation is obsolete or out of date. On the basis of the data provided by Member States, it was concluded that the impact of a repeal of the Regulation would be very minimal. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91 and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 to eliminate inconsistencies in the EU legal order and will contribute to simplification by eliminating a legal act which is now obsolete.

1315EP8,"""""Cloning of animals kept and reproduced for farming purposes""""",0.371,0.833,1.0,0.583,0.135,0.224,0.89,0.942,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to suspend the use of the technique and the marketing of animal clones for farming purposes ensures that all Union farmers and breeders are subject to the same conditions while adequately protecting animal welfare. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 98/58/EC on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes sets very general minimum animal welfare standards for animals used in agriculture. It does not refer explicitly to cloning, but calls on Member States to avoid unnecessary pain, suffering or injury in farm animals. If cloning causes unnecessary pain, suffering or injury Member States have to act at national level to avoid it. In 2008, the Commission presented a proposal to streamline the approval process in Regulation (EC) N° 258/97 on novel foods. In the legislative procedure, lawmakers aimed to amend the proposal to introduce specific rules on cloning. Yet no agreement was reached on the scope and features of these insertions so that the proposal was abandoned after a failed Conciliation in March 2011. As a result, the Commission was asked to prepare a legislative proposal on cloning in food production based on an impact assessment outside the Novel Food Regulation. The European Parliament resolution of 6 July 2011 on the Commission Work Programme 2012 requested a legislative proposal to prohibit food from clones, offspring and descendants. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) views cloning primarily as an animal welfare hazard related to the low efficiency of the technique. It up-dated its opinion on cloning of animals in 2012 concluding that scientific knowledge available on cloning has increased but that nevertheless its efficiency remains low compared to other reproduction techniques. Union citizens , on the other hand, held a broadly negative perception of the use of the cloning technique for the production of animals for farming purposes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option calling for a temporary suspension of the technique and of imports of live clones was retained as the basis of the present proposal. CONTENT: the proposal envisages a suspension on Union territory of: the use of the technique for food production purposes; the marketing of live clones (animal clones). These provisional prohibitions will confine a production technique causing distress to animals to areas where it appears to have particular benefit. The provisional prohibitions are kept under review given the development of knowledge on the technique and progress in the application of the technique in areas outside farming. This proposal excludes cloning carried out in research, for the preservation of rare breeds or endangered species and for the production of medicinal products and medical devices."
3331EP7,"""""Marketing and use of explosives precursors""""",0.649,0.861,0.737,0.484,0.515,0.831,0.81,0.629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to reduce access by the general public to high-risk chemicals suitable for easy misuse in producing home-made explosives. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: home-made explosives, fabricated from certain easily accessible chemical precursors, are a preferred tool for perpetrators of terrorist attacks. Currently, the general public has relatively easy access to these chemicals even when in concentrations sufficient to produce a powerful explosive device. The scale of the problem is amplified by the fact that the chemical market in the EU is large and diversified, with multiple end-users. Some Member States have already adopted either voluntary or legislative measures to reduce the availability of the chemical precursors to explosives, or a combination of both. Some Member States are considering such measures but are waiting for the EU to provide leadership. While several legislative and non-legislative measures exist at international, EU and national level, these either do not specifically focus on the security risks associated with certain chemicals or do not cover the entire EU. This implies that precursors that may be restricted or controlled in one country can be easily obtained in another. The current differences among the regimes applied to chemical precursors to explosives not only have a negative effect on security but also distort the functioning of the internal market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the options considered included: (i) voluntary measures by the private sector (industry and retail); (ii) regulatory action carried out by the Member States individually; (iii) legislative measures at the EU level; (iv) a combination of these. Several policy options for legislative action at EU level have undergone a thorough impact assessment and consultation process. The preferred policy option has positive impacts in terms of security, but also some negative economic impacts in particular on the retail sector and on public authorities of the Member States in terms of costs of implementation. However, these economic impacts and negative impacts on consumers are relatively minor as non-professional consumption of the precursors only accounts for about 1.5% of total EU consumption of the chemicals concerned, and substitutes are in most cases available. It should be noted that the proposal was subject to an in-depth scrutiny to ensure that its provisions are fully compatible with fundamental rights and principles enshrined in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and notably the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property and the principle of non-discrimination. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. A regulation is the appropriate instrument to achieve maximum harmonisation for the chemicals covered by the legal instrument, and also, where applicable, concentrations of these chemicals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes harmonised rules concerning the making available on the market of substances or mixtures that could be misused for the illicit manufacture of explosives, with a view to limiting their availability to the general public. This will be done by prohibiting the sales of certain chemicals above concentration thresholds to members of the general public. Sales of higher concentrations would only be allowed to users who can document a legitimate need to use the chemical — these users can obtain a licence to purchase the chemical. The sales of these chemicals and their mixtures as well as the sales of products containing chemicals of concern for which concentration thresholds cannot be set will also be subject to reporting of suspicious transactions. The substances and concentration thresholds are clearly set out in the Annex to the Regulation. Each Member State shall ensure that the processing of personal data carried out in application of this Regulation shall be in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC. In particular, each Member State shall ensure that the processing of personal data required by the granting of license, and the reporting of suspicious transactions shall comply with Directive 95/46/EC. Reasonably long transitional periods are foreseen so as to allow members of the general public and economic operators to adapt to the new requirements. The proposed legislative action will be accompanied by voluntary measures by industry and the retail sector to enhance security and raise awareness in the entire supply chain. The proposal is in line with the policy objectives set out in the EU Counter terrorism Strategy, the Action Plan on Enhancing the Security of Explosives and the Stockholm Programme — An open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the European Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the European Union and the United States concluded a Memorandum of Understanding, revised in 2014, which provided an interim solution to a long-standing dispute in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over imports of US beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. Under the agreement, a 45 000 tonnes quota of non-hormone treated beef was open by the EU to qualifying suppliers. Under WTO rules the quota also had to be made available to non-US suppliers. On 19 October 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations between the EU and the United States on the functioning of the tariff quota. Negotiations with the United States were concluded on 27 February 2019. The signed agreement, subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the EU and the United States on the allocation to the United States of a share in the tariff quota for high-quality beef referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding on the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by the United States to certain EU products, which was concluded in 2009 and revised in 2014. Under the new agreement, the existing quota will remain unchanged but 35 000 out of the total 45 000-tonne TRQ will be ring-fenced for the United States and phased in over a period of 7 years. The autonomous tariff quotas will continue to cover only products complying with EU's high food safety and health standards. This step is key to resolving a long-standing dispute between the EU and the United States on measures imposed by the EU in 1989 on US exports of beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. It also underlines the EU's commitment to a positive transatlantic trade agenda."
6560EP8,"""""Establishing a centralised system for the identification of Member States holding conviction information on third country nationals and stateless persons (TCN) to supplement and support the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS-TCN system) """"",0.871,0.792,0.88,0.521,0.154,0.925,0.822,0.692,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to allow the rapid and efficient exchange of information on the criminal records of third-country nationals. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of providing EU citizens with an area of ​​freedom, security and justice without internal borders presupposes exchanging information extracted from criminal records between the competent authorities of the Member States. These exchanges of information are organised and facilitated by the rules laid down in Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record between Member States, a new criminal procedure and the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) established by Council Decision 2009/316/JHA. Although it is possible to exchange information on convictions concerning third-country nationals (TCNs) through ECRIS, there is no procedure or mechanism to do so in an efficient manner. Information on third country nationals is not gathered within the Union in the Member State of nationality as it is for nationals of Member States, but only stored in the Member States where the convictions have been handed down. A complete overview of the criminal history of a third country national can therefore be ascertained only if such information is requested from all Member States. Such 'blanket requests' impose an administrative burden on all Member States, including those not holding information on that third country national. In practice, this burden deters Member States from requesting information on third country nationals, and leads to Member States limiting the criminal record information to information stored in their national register. To improve the situation, it is proposed to establish a system by which the central authority of a Member State can find out quickly and efficiently in which other Member State(s) criminal record information on a third country national is stored. As a result of the terrorist attacks in many European cities, exchange of information on criminal records is crucial to combat cross-border crime. The initiative follows the requests of the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council to improve the existing ECRIS. It also reflects the Commission's new approach to the management of data for borders and security. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the creation of a centralised ECRIS-TCN system containing both alphanumeric data and fingerprints is the preferred solution. It would be the most cost efficient, and technically less complex and easier to maintain compared to the others. This option also offers the additional advantages of making the ECRIS-TCN system suitable for participating in a future shared biometric matching service and a common identity repository, facilitating direct access for Eurojust, Europol, [and the European Public Prosecutor's Office] and creating a central contact point at Eurojust for third States requiring information on convicted TCN. If Member States were to systematically send ‘blanket’ requests, the administrative burden in responding to them has been identified as the most costly element (estimated up to EUR 78 million) of the ECRIS-workflow; the proposed solution saves such costs. CONTENT: this proposal supplements the Commission's 2016 proposal for a Directive to amend the ECRIS Framework Decision and to repeal the ECRIS Council Decision: creating a centralised system to efficiently identify which Member State(s) hold conviction information on TCN; establishing rules under which the ECRIS-TCN system is used by competent authorities to obtain information on such previous convictions through the European Criminal Records Information System. The proposed hit/no hit search system, based on alphanumeric data and fingerprints of TCN convicted in the Member States, will allow Member States to quickly identify other Member State(s) having convicted a particular TCN. The requesting Member State should then request those identified Member States to provide the actual conviction information through the existing ECRIS system as improved by January 2016 proposal. As soon as this becomes technically possible, facial images may also be used to identify a third country national on the basis of this biometric identifier The proposal sets an obligation for the convicting Member State: to create a data record in the Central ECRIS-TCN System for each convicted TCN as soon as possible after the conviction was entered into the national criminal records register; to create records in the ECRIS-TCN system of 'historical' convictions of third country nationals, i.e. convictions handed down prior to the entry into force of the Regulation. Member States would be required to use the ECRIS-TCN system in all cases where they receive a request for information on previous convictions of third country nationals in accordance with national law, and to follow up on any hits with the Member States identified through the ECRIS system. They would also be required to verify the accuracy of the data sent to the Central System and to correct them, as well as to amend the data sent to the Central System in case of any subsequent amendment in national criminal records. The proposal entrusts eu-LISA with the task of developing and operationally managing the ECRIS-TCN system. It nominates Eurojust as the contact point for third countries and international organisations which wish to request conviction information on a TCN. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on the EU and national budgets would be as follows: (i) one-off costs for the EU of around EUR 13 002 000; (ii) for the Member States approximately EUR 13 344 000 (a total of approximately EUR 26 346 000). Total on-going costs are expected to increase gradually over the years, starting at EUR 8 220 000 and increasing up to a maximum of EUR 17 520 000."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: by Decision of 30 November 2009, the Council concluded the agreement between the European Community and St Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver. Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and St Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition. With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with St Kitts and Nevis were successfully finalised by the initialling of the amending agreement on 28 July 2016. CONTENT: this proposal is presented to the Council to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement between the European Community and St Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver. The amendments introduced by the final agreement cover the following points: Duration of stay: the final agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of St Kitts and Nevis when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). A joint statement on the interpretation of the 90-day period over any 180-day period is attached to the amending agreement. Suspension of the agreement: the agreement provides that suspension of the waiver shall be lifted if the suspension is no longer required. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Community and St Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver remain unaffected by the amending agreement, including the territorial scope. The provisions of the agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2004/39/EC and 2009/…/EC. BACKGROUND: around €2 trillion in assets are currently managed by AIFM employing a variety of investment techniques, investing in different asset markets and catering to different investor populations. The sector includes hedge funds and private equity, as well as real estate funds, commodity funds, infrastructure funds and other types of institutional fund. The financial crisis has exposed a series of vulnerabilities in the global financial system. It has highlighted how risks crystallising in one sector can be transmitted rapidly around the financial system, with serious repercussions for all financial market participants and for the stability of the underlying markets. This proposal forms part of an ambitious Commission programme to extend appropriate regulation and oversight to all actors and activities that embed significant risks. The proposed legislation will introduce harmonised requirements for entities engaged in the management and administration of alternative investment funds (AIFM). The need for closer regulatory engagement with this sector has been highlighted by the European Parliament and by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision chaired by Jacques de Larosière. It is also the subject of ongoing discussion at international level, for example through the work of the G20. It is in recognition of these weaknesses and inefficiencies in the existing regulatory framework that the European Commission has committed to bring forward a proposal for a comprehensive legislative instrument establishing regulatory and supervisory standards for hedge funds, private equity and other systemically important market players. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment covers five policy options: Option 1 : Do nothing; Option 2 : Self-regulation by AIFM industry; Option 3 : Member State action; Option 4 : EU-level action; Option 5 : International-level action. The Commission concludes that, in comparison with industry and national action, EU‑level action has clear advantages, both in terms of effective risk monitoring and control and in providing a secure framework for pan-European AIF distribution. There is a risk that such an approach would not take adequate account of the international dimension. However, international-level agreements would take considerable time to conclude and would likely be limited to broad principles. EU-level action is therefore the preferred option. CONTENT: this proposal focuses on those activities that are specific or inherent to the AIFM sector and hence need to be addressed by targeted requirements. A number of the concerns that are commonly expressed about the activities of AIFM are linked to behaviours (e.g., short-selling, use of stock borrowing or other instruments to build a stake in company) which are not unique to this category of financial market participant. To be fully effective and coherent, these concerns must be addressed by comprehensive measures which apply to all market participants who engage in the relevant activities. This proposal is therefore designed to address matters that call for provisions specific to AIFM and their business. Scope and definitions : in order to ensure that all AIFM operating in the European Union are subject to effective supervision and oversight, the proposed Directive introduces a legally binding authorisation and supervisory regime for all AIFM managing AIF in the European Union. The regime will apply irrespective of the legal domicile of the AIF managed. Operating conditions and initial authorisation : to operate in the European Union, all AIFM will be required to obtain authorisation from the competent authority of their home Member State. All AIFM operating on European soil will be required to demonstrate that they are suitably qualified to provide AIF management services and will be required to provide detailed information on the planned activity of the AIFM, the identity and characteristics of the AIF managed, the governance of the AIFM, arrangements for the valuation and safe-keeping of assets and the systems of regulatory reporting, where required. The AIFM will also be required to hold and retain a minimum level of capital. Treatment of investors : the proposed Directive requires AIFM to provide to their investors a clear description of the investment policy, including descriptions of the type of assets and the use of leverage; redemption policy in normal and exceptional circumstances; valuation, custody, administration and risk management procedures; and fees, charges and expenses associated with the investment. Disclosure to regulators : to support the effective macro-prudential oversight of AIFM activities, the AIFM will also be required to report to the competent authority on a regular basis on the principal markets and instruments in which it trades, its principal exposures, performance data and concentrations of risk. Specific requirements for AIFM managing leveraged AIF : the proposal: (i) empowers the Commission to set leverage limits through comitology procedures where this is required to ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system; (ii) grants additional emergency powers to the national authorities to restrict the use of leverage in respect of individual managers and funds in exceptional circumstances; (iii) foresees that AIFM employing leverage on a systematic basis above a defined threshold will be required to disclose aggregate leverage in all forms, and the main sources of leverage to the home authority of the AIFM. Specific requirements for AIFM acquiring controlling stakes in companies : the proposal: (i) provides for disclosures of information to other shareholders and the representatives of employees of the portfolio company in which the AIFM acquired a controlling interest; (ii) foresees that the AIFM issues annual disclosure on the investment strategy and objectives of its fund when acquiring control of companies, and general disclosures about the performance of the portfolio company following acquisition of control. Rights of AIFM under the Directive : in order to facilitate the development of the single market, an AIFM authorised in its home Member State will be entitled to market its funds to professional investors on the territory of any Member State. Member States will not be permitted to impose additional requirements on AIFM domiciled in another Member State insofar as marketing to professional investors is concerned. Third country aspects : the proposed Directive permits AIFM to market AIF located in third country domiciles subject to strict controls on the performance of key functions by service providers in those jurisdictions. The rights granted under the Directive to market such AIF to professional investors will only become effective three years after the transposition period. Supervisory cooperation information sharing and mediation : In order to ensure the secure functioning of the AIFM sector, competent authorities of the Member States will be required to cooperate whenever necessary so as to achieve the aims of the Directive. Given the cross-border nature of risks arising in the AIFM sector, a prerequisite for effective macro-prudential oversight will be the timely sharing of relevant macroprudential data at the European, or even global, level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission The negotiations with Kiribati were opened on 17 December 2014 and conducted by exchange of letters. During further exchanges agreement was reached on all aspects. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 6 May 2015 (Kiribati) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Kiribati when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Kiribati may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Kiribati to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Kiribati remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Kiribati to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Council authorised the European Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the European Union, the renewal of the Agreement between the Government of Senegal and the European Economic Community on fishing off the coast of Senegal, which entered into force on 1 June 1981, and a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution. At the end of the negotiations, a new draft Agreement and Protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 25 April 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the draft Agreement and the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement lays down the following: Main objectives of the Agreement: the main aim of the new Agreement is to provide an updated framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and Senegal in the field of fisheries. The aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Senegalese waters taking into account available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with the best available scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the EU and Senegal to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Senegalese fishing zones, in the interests of both parties. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution has been set at: based on: This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of Senegal in terms of support for scientific research, for monitoring and fighting against illegal fishing, and for small-scale fishing, including the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems to allow the recovery of juvenile stocks.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is a continuation of the ‘ European Green Deal ’ which reaffirms the Commission’s ambition to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. In its Communication of 28 November 2018 ‘A clean planet for all’, the Commission already set out its strategic long-term vision of a Union with zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 through a socially fair and cost efficient transition. The European Parliament endorsed the EU's long-term objective of climate neutrality. It called for the necessary transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050 at the latest, expressing the wish that this transition should become a true European success story and declared the climate and environmental urgency in its resolution of 28 November 2019. The European Council has set building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe as one of the main four priorities in its Strategic Agenda for 2019-2024. It also endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, while recognising the need to put in place an enabling framework and that the transition will require significant public and private investments. The EU has put in place a comprehensive framework of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has already started to modernise and transform the economy with the aim of climate neutrality. Between 1990 and 2018, it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 23%, while the economy grew by 61%. Despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Commission considers it imperative to take further action, involving all sectors, as current policies are expected to only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2050. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to complement the existing policy framework by setting the long-term direction of travel and enshrining the 2050 climate-neutrality objective in EU law, enhancing adaptation efforts, establishing a process to set out and review a trajectory until 2050, regular assessment and a process in case of insufficient progress or inconsistencies. Its aim is to: - provide a direction by setting a pathway to climate neutrality, and enhance certainty and confidence on the EU’s commitment for businesses, workers, investors and consumers, as well as transparency and accountability, thus sustaining prosperity and job creation; - contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, including its long-term goal to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to below 1.5°C as well as to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Climate neutrality target for 2050 The proposal sets out the EU's climate neutrality objective for 2050, which covers all sectors and all greenhouse gases (not just CO2) and applies to the whole Union. It also obliges the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Member States to take, at their respective levels, the necessary measures to achieve this objective. The proposal also sets out the way forward to achieve the 2050 target: - by September 2020, the Commission shall present a plan with an impact assessment to increase the EU's 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target to at least 50% and move towards 55% below 1990 levels in a responsible manner. If necessary, it shall propose amending EU climate law accordingly; - by 30 June 2021 at the latest, the Commission shall assess and propose to revise, if appropriate, all relevant policy instruments in order to achieve the additional greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030. Trajectory towards climate neutrality For the period 2030 to 2050, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by setting out a trajectory at Union level to achieve over time the 2050 objective. The Commission shall review the EU trajectory every 5 years. Under the Paris Agreement, the Parties periodically take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assess the collective progress made in achieving its purpose and long-term goals (the so-called ‘global stocktaking’ exercise). At the latest within six months of each global stocktake, the Commission shall review the trajectory. Adaptation to climate change The proposal obliges the relevant EU institutions and Member States to ensure that steady progress is made in improving adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. To this end, Member States shall adopt comprehensive national adaptation strategies and plans. Regular assessment By 30 September 2023 at the latest, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall assess the progress made, in line with the deadlines set out in the Paris Agreement. If the assessment shows that EU measures are inconsistent or inadequate in relation to the objective pursued, or that progress is insufficient, the Commission shall take appropriate action. The Commission shall also regularly assess relevant national measures and issue recommendations where it finds inconsistencies or that measures are inadequate. Public participation The Commission shall engage in dialogue with all parts of society to empower them to take action for a climate-neutral society. Each Member State shall establish a multilevel climate and energy dialogue pursuant to national rules, in which all relevant stakeholders and the general public are able actively to engage and discuss the achievement of the Union’s climate-neutrality objective."
4798EP7,"""""European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR)""""",0.649,0.758,0.018,0.355,0.333,0.687,0.785,0.057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) with the aim of increasing coordination within and between Member States to prevent and tackle serious crime. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal shall provide for the necessary legal framework to respond to the request of the European Council of 23-24 June 2011 to further develop the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) as a matter of priority in order to become operational by 2013, allowing Member States' authorities carrying out border surveillance activities and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), to share operational information and improve cooperation. The aim of EUROSUR is to reinforce the control of the Schengen external borders . EUROSUR will establish a mechanism for Member States' authorities carrying out border surveillance activities to share operational information and to cooperate with each other and with the Agency in order to reduce the loss of lives at sea and the number of irregular immigrants entering the EU undetected, and to increase internal security by preventing cross-border crimes, such as trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of drugs. The works currently carried out for the testing and the gradual establishment of EUROSUR are based on a roadmap presented in a Commission Communication in 2008. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has identified four policy options comprising of sub-options: Option 1 : fully decentralised - with the support of the National Coordination Centres (NCC) ; Option 2 : partly centralised – for the EUROSUR network ; Option 3 : fully centralised approach and including a sub-option ‘Cooperation with third countries”; Option 4 : common applications of surveillance tools at EU level. In line with the impact assessment, the following options would be the preferred ones: with regard to the establishment of NCCs, Option 1.1 is the preferred option, because it does not require Member States to restructure their national administrations and thus could be easily implemented; following the decentralised approach for setting up EUROSUR, the preferred policy option for the EUROSUR network is Option 2.2; taking into account the urgent need for enhancing border control in the Mediterranean region, Option 3.2 provides the best answer on how to promote the cooperation with neighbouring third countries. However, the willingness of northern African countries to cooperate is a precondition for the implementation of Option 3.2. for the common application of surveillance tools, Option 4.2 is the option providing most added value. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77(2)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) according to which the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall adopt measures concerning any measure necessary for the gradual establishment of an integrated management system for external borders. CONTENT: this proposal establishes a common framework for the exchange of information and cooperation between Member States and the Agency in order to improve the situational awareness and reaction capability at the external borders of the Member States and of the European Union, the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR). The purpose of the legislative proposal is to improve the situational awareness and reaction capability of Member States and the Agency when preventing irregular migration and cross-border crime at the external land and maritime borders. Common framework : a common framework shall be established with clear responsibilities and competencies for the national coordination centres (NCC) for border surveillance in the Member States and the Agency, which form the backbone of EUROSUR. These centres, which shall ensure an effective and efficient management of resources and personnel at national level, and the Agency shall communicate with each other via the communication network, which would allow to exchange both non-classified sensitive as well as classified information. For the exchange of information and cooperation in the field of border surveillance, Member States and the Agency shall use the framework of EUROSUR, consisting of the following components: (i) national coordination centres for border surveillance; (ii) national situational pictures; (iii) communication network; (iv) European situational picture; (v) common pre-frontier intelligence picture; (vi) common application of surveillance tools. The proposal also outlines the objectives of: Situational pictures : the cooperation and information exchange between the national coordination centres and the Agency is done via 'situational pictures', which shall be established at national and European level as well as for the pre-frontier area. These three pictures, of which the two latter shall be managed by the Agency, are structured in a similar way to facilitate the flow of information among them. The situational pictures will as a general rule not involve personal data but rather the exchange of information on incidents and depersonalised objects, such as the detection and tracking of vessels. In exceptional cases personal data may form part of the data shared by Member States with the Agency provided that the conditions of Frontex Regulation are met. To the extent personal data forms part of the national situational picture of neighbouring external border sections, it may be exchanged between neighbouring Member States only, under the conditions set by the horizontal EU legal framework on data protection; Surveillance tools : the Agency shall provide a service for the common application of surveillance tools, taking into account that such a service can be provided more cost-efficiently at European level. Such a service could be implemented with the support of relevant European space programmes, including the operational Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). The approach chosen in EUROSUR is to make best use of existing information, capabilities and systems available in other EU agencies to the extent possible. For this reason, the Agency would closely cooperate with the EU Satellite Centre, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency in providing the service for the common application of surveillance tools as well as with EUROPOL in order to exchange information on cross-border crime. With regard to maritime traffic data to be provided by the SafeSeaNet system under Directive 2002/59/EC, the Commission intends to make an appropriate proposal modifying the Directive in 2013. It is envisaged that the relevant information in SafeSeaNet will also be made available for purposes other than those related to maritime safety, maritime security and marine environment protection and thereby be part of the surveillance tools used in the EUROSUR framework. Reaction capacity : better awareness of what is going on at the external borders is only of limited value if it is not complemented by an improved capability of EU Member States to react to challenges faced at their external borders. For this reason, Member States shall divide their external borders into borders sections, to which – based on risk analysis and the number of incidents occuring – impact levels shall be attributed. Depending on which impact levels have been attributed, the national coordination centres and the Agency shall take counter-measures in order to lower the impact on the border section in question. Cooperation with third countries : exisiting and planned regional networks set up between Member States and neighbouring third countries shall be linked to EUROSUR via the national coordination centres. Implementation : taking into account that Member States and the Agency are already in the process of setting up the different components of EUROSUR at national and European level, EUROSUR should become operational in the second half of 2013. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission should provide the Agency with technical support on the further technical development of EUROSUR. Monitoring and evaluation : t he Agency shall submit a report on the functioning of EUROSUR on 1 October 2015 and every two years thereafter. The Commission shall provide an overall evaluation of EUROSUR to the European Parliament and the Council on 1 October 2016 and every four years thereafter. Fundamental rights and data protection requirements : this proposal was subjected to scrutiny to ensure that its provisions are fully compatible with fundamental rights and notably human dignity, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, right to liberty and security, right to the protection of personal data, non-refoulement, non-discrimination and rights of the child. Particular attention was paid to Articles 4 and 19(2) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which prohibit removal of persons to a State where there is a serious risk of death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The draft Regulation explicitly prohibits any exchange of information with a third country that could use this information to identify persons or groups of persons who are under a serious risk of being subjected to torture, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment or any other violation of fundamental rights. It explicitly provides that Member States and the Agency shall give priority to the special needs of children, victims of trafficking, persons in need of urgent medical assistance, persons in need of international protection, persons in distress at sea and other persons in a particularly vulnerable situation. The protection of personal data is also of particular importance as data sharing may include personal data, in which situation the data protection rules apply and must be fully respected. Territorial provisions : this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis, in which the United Kingdom and Ireland are not participating but which applies to 4 associated countries (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the different components of EUROSUR will be mainly implemented by the Agency and by Member States (shared management) on the basis of the 2008 EUROSUR roadmap: with regard to setting up the national coordination centres, Member States will be supported by the External Borders Fund in 2012-2013 and the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the planned Internal Security Fund in 2014-2020; the Agency will use its own budget to set up the communication network and other horizontal components of EUROSUR, such as the European situational picture and the common pre-frontier intelligence picture, and when necessary this is completed by support under the Internal Security Fund (direct or indirect centralised financial management); funding provided under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development will support the setting up of the envisaged service for the common application of surveillance tools in 2012-2013; measures in neighbouring third countries will be supported in 2012-2013 by the Thematic Programme for Asylum and Migration, as part of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The impact assessment provides a financial envelope of EUR 338.7 million from 2011 to 2020."

The aim of the Implementing Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone in accordance with the best available scientific advice and the resolutions and recommendations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone and in the Indian Ocean, in the interest of both parties. In addition, this cooperation will also contribute to promote decent working conditions in fisheries activities. Fishing opportunities The new Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - 40 tuna purse seine vessels; - 8 surface longliners; - support vessels in accordance with the relevant IOTC resolutions. The conclusion of the Agreement and its Implementing Protocol enables to continue and reinforce the strategic fisheries partnership between the European Union and Seychelles. It will create fishing opportunities for Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone. It will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the Fisheries Comprehensive Plan, the monitoring and combating illegal fishing, and the support for the small-scale fisheries sector. Lastly, the Agreement and the Protocol will contribute to Seychelles’ sustainable exploitation of its marine resources and to Seychelles’ fishing economy by promoting growth and decent working conditions, associated with fishing-related economic activities. Budgetary implications The EU annual financial contribution is EUR 5 300 000, based on: - an annual amount for access to the fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone of EUR 2 500 000 equivalent to a reference tonnage, for highly migratory species, of 50 000 tonnes per year; - support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Seychelles, amounting to EUR 2 800 000 per year. This support meets the objectives of Seychelles’ Fisheries Comprehensive Plan. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure, including for the reserve line for protocols not having entered into force at the beginning of the year."
2066EP7,"""""Multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013""""",0.035,0.905,0.86,0.129,0.212,0.952,0.897,0.514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"PURPOSE: to propose a new multiannual financial framework (2007-2013) revising and codifying the current financial framework taking into account the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) stipulates that a unanimously adopted Council Regulation shall lay down a multiannual financial framework. The financial framework shall determine the amounts of the annual ceilings on commitment appropriations by category of expenditure and of the annual ceiling on payment appropriations and it shall lay down any other provisions required for the annual budgetary procedure to run smoothly. The practice to adopt a multiannual financial framework and provisions on the interinstitutional cooperation and budgetary discipline started more than 20 years ago. It has immensely improved and simplified the annual budget procedure and cooperation between institutions and, as a consequence, increased the budgetary discipline. The current multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 was agreed between institutions in May 2006 and is laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (the IIA). With the entry into force of the TFEU, the relevant provisions of the current IIA need to be codified into a Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework (the MFF regulation). This codification represents an alignment of the provisions of the current IIA with the requirements of the Treaty. However, this alignment has to take into account the change of instrument, i.e. a regulation instead of an IIA. For legal reasons, it is, however, neither possible nor feasible to transpose all the provisions of the current IIA into the MFF regulation. Some of the provisions of the current IIA became obsolete with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, many shall be incorporated in this MFF regulation, and some in the revised Financial Regulation. A new IIA is still necessary for those provisions that do not fit into either of these two regulations and incorporate them into the framework of a revised IIA (provisions on interinstitutional cooperation, in particular). Taking into account all the relevant provisions and requirements of the Treaty, the current proposal seeks to focus on the financial framework in the strictest sense (e.g. annual adjustments of the financial framework, revision of the financial framework…). Some of the other provisions previously in the IIA have become obsolete (i) provisions related to the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and the maximum rate of increase, (ii) the classification of expenditure, (iii) significant parts of inter-institutional cooperation are either inappropriate for a regulation of this type and should fall within the financial regulation (rather than in the MFF regulation) or in the IIA. The remaining provisions – mainly issues relating to pure interinstitutional cooperation – are included in a new IIA which is the subject of a separate procedure. For the sake of integrity, the draft MFF Regulation and the new IIA are presented together and should be negotiated and agreed as one integral package. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) – special legislative procedure. CONTENT: since 1988, the multiannual financial framework and related provisions have been laid down in interinstitutional agreements. The multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 was established by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 (the IIA). With the entry into force of the TFEU, the practice of fixing the financial framework by interinstitutional agreement has to be reviewed and the multiannual financial framework has to be laid down in the form of a regulation. This is the purpose of this proposal which integrates the appropriate provisions of the old IIA and takes into account, where required, of the amendments that are required by the new Treaty. As a result, the IIA is to be amended as follows: maintenance of the current financial framework: the financial framework has not been changed; an obligation to respect the ceilings on expenditures of budgetary heading s and the ceilings on own resources: as before, the annual ceilings are retained, as well as the requirement for the institutions to respect these ceilings during the budgetary procedure. Should the ceilings for payment appropriations result in a call-in rate for own resources exceeding the own resources ceiling, the ceilings of the financial framework have to be adjusted; the possibility to exceed the ceilings under certain conditions: provision is made for the possibility to exceed the ceilings, if necessary, when the instruments not included in the financial framework are mobilised, i.e. the Emergency Aid Reserve, the Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (these instruments are now defined in the new IIA). They are not included in the financial framework and ensure that financing in specific circumstances is provided in excess of the ceilings of the financial framework, if it is required. They increase the flexibility of the financial framework and are mobilised jointly by the two arms of budgetary authority; rules on annual technical adjustment of the financial framework are unchanged: the rules agreed regarding the annual technical adjustment of the financial framework are unchanged (revaluation of the financial framework at year n+1 prices and on the basis of a fixed deflator of 2% a year); adjustment of cohesion policy envelopes : the wording in this part has only been slightly changed. The reference to the current IIA was replaced with the reference to the period when the cohesion policy envelopes were agreed. The adjustment of cohesion policy envelopes will be made in the technical adjustment for the year 2011, to be presented in April 2010. This adjustment will take place if it is established that cumulated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of any Member State for the years 2007-2009 has diverged by more than +/- 5 % from the cumulated GDP estimated in 2005 for the establishment of cohesion policy envelopes for Member States for the period 2007-2013; adjustments related to excessive government deficit : the wording of these articles has either not changed or only changed very marginally (reference to the voting rules for the adaptation of implementation conditions, in particular); revision of the financial framework : the revisions of the financial framework are adopted according to the same rules as the regulation itself. In order to retain the current level of flexibility of the financial framework as regards the revisions below the threshold of 0.03% of GNI, paragraph 3 stipulates that the financial framework may be adapted, if need be, and within the threshold of 0.03%, in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure. This does not change the current practice where revisions below the same threshold were jointly decided by Parliament and Council, with Council deciding by qualified majority. It should be noted that the rules regarding the revision of the financial framework in the event of a revision of the Treaty or enlargement have not been revised; interinstitutional cooperation in the budgetary procedure : this article lays down the general principles in regard to interinstitutional cooperation in the context of the budgetary procedure: i) the principle of good faith between the institutions throughout the procedure with a view to reconciling their positions; ii) appropriate interinstitutional contacts to monitor the progress of the work; iii) coordination of their respective calendars of work to enable proceedings to be conducted in a coherent and convergent fashion; iv) the retention of the principle of interinstitutional trilogues at all stages of the procedure to facilitate agreement on the budget. The technical details of the cooperation are included in the new IIA; financing of the CFSP: the financing of the Common Foreign and Security Policy has a special standing during the budgetary procedure. In order to maintain the current balance and to help the budgetary procedure to run smoothly, the basic rules (the amount entered in one budget chapter covering the real predictable needs, no funds entered in a reserve) and the amount agreed for the financing of the CFSP (without change) are introduced in the MFF Regulation. The total amount of operating CFSP expenditure shall be entered entirely in one budget chapter, entitled CFSP. That amount shall cover the real predictable needs, assessed in the framework of the establishment of the draft budget, on the basis of forecasts drawn up annually by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and a reasonable margin for unforeseen actions. No funds may be entered in a reserve. An amount of at least EUR 1 740 million shall be available for the CFSP over the period 2007-2013; consequences of the absence of a financial framework: overall, the rules relating to the duration of the financial framework and the consequences of the absence of a financial framework are retained. The obligation for the Commission to present a new financial framework before July 2011 is also maintained. Minor changes have been made to align with the wording of the TFEU; entry into force: it is planned that the new IIA will enter into force on the same day as this proposed regulation. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal has no impact on the EU’s budget. It corresponds to the financial framework as revised for the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), adopted by the Council and Parliament on 17 December 2009."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: under Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/2446, products obtained in Norway, Switzerland or Turkey incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there are to be considered as originating in a beneficiary country, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 45 of that Delegated Regulation (so-called 'cumulation' system). The cumulation system shall apply provided that Norway reciprocally grants the same treatment to products originating in the beneficiary countries which incorporate materials originating in the Union. In the case of Norway, the cumulation system was originally put in place by means of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Norway. That exchange of letters took place on 29 January 2001, following the approval of the Council by Decision 2001/101/EC. In order to ensure the application of a concept of origin corresponding to that set out in the rules of origin in the Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), Norway amended its GSP rules of origin. Therefore, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Norway must be revised. The rules of origin in the GSP were reformed in 2010. They provide for the implementation of a new system for the establishment of proofs of origin by registered exporters, which will apply from 1 January 2017. In order to anticipate the application of that new system and the rules, on 8 March 2012 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Norway, in the form of an exchange of letters, on the mutual acceptance of replacement certificates of origin Form A or replacement statements of origin. The negotiations resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Norway which should be approved. CONTENT: the draft decision seeks the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Norway on the cumulation of origin between the European Union, Switzerland, Norway and Turkey in the framework of the Generalised System of Preferences of the European Union. Under the agreement, certain products with content of Norwegian, Swiss or Turkish origin are to be treated on their arrival on the customs territory of the Union as products with content of Union origin."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: ESA is an essential tool at European level, used for major administrative purposes (e.g. own resources, excessive deficit procedure, structural funds) and for the analysis of the coordination and convergence of Member States’ economic policies. The ESA provides EU institutions, governments and economic and social operators with a set of harmonised and reliable statistics on which to base their decisions. The ESA revision follows the revision of the International System of National Accounts (SNA 93). The new SNA (2008 SNA) was published in 2009 by the five international organisations which worked on the new Manual (IMF, OECD, UN Statistical Division, World Bank and Eurostat) in order to bring national accounts more in line with the new economic environment. There is a need to revise the European system of accounts (ESA 95) set up by Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 in order to take into account these new developments so that that system constitutes a version of 2008 SNA adapted to the structures of the Member States' economies, and so that the data of the Union are comparable with those compiled by its main international partners. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: if ESA was not revised, this would weaken the comparability of national accounts and aggregates, first between Member States as the revision will be the occasion to specify new methodological rules for issues that have emerged in the fifteen last years, secondly at international level as SNA has just been revised. LEGAL BASE: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the proposed Regulation (ESA 2010) is to revise ESA both concerning the methodology on common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, and the programme for transmitting for Union purposes accounts and tables compiled according to the methodology. ESA 2010 is gradually to replace all other systems as a reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the requirements of the Union, so that results that are comparable between the Member States can be obtained. The proposal includes a methodology and a transmission programme (which defines accounts and tables to be provided by all Member States according to specified deadlines). The Commission should make those accounts and tables available to users on precise dates, particularly with regard to monitoring the economic convergence and achieving close coordination of the Member States' economic policies.  Attention should be paid in the case of environmental and social accounts to the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 20 August 2009 entitled "" GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world "". Therefore, further methodological studies and data tests may be required, in particular on issues related to GDP and beyond and Europe 2020 with the aim of developing a more comprehensive measurement approach for wellbeing and progress in order to support the promotion of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. Taking into consideration the findings of the task force, it may be necessary to amend the methodology for the calculation and allocation of Fisim, by means of a delegated act before the end of 2012, in order to provide more reliable results. Lastly, research and development expenditure has the nature of investment and should therefore be recorded as fixed capital formation. However, it is necessary to specify the format of the data to be recorded as fixed capital formation by means of a delegated act when a sufficient level of confidence in the reliability of the data is reached. The proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: with the accession of Croatia, the European Union enlarged its customs union. Consequently, the European Union was required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules (Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994) to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment. On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of the Republic of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. The Council (Trade Policy Committee) has been regularly consulted on the content and advancement of the negotiations. The European Parliament (INTA Committee) has been informed. Negotiations with the Eastern Republic of Uruguay resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 18 December 2015 in Nairobi (the Agreement). CONTENT: this proposal asks the Council to adopt a decision to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with the Uruguay. In parallel, a separate proposal on the signature of this Agreement is also submitted. As a result of the Agreement, the Commission will adopt an implementing Regulation to extend the following tariff rate quotas, pursuant to Article 187(a) of the Single Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013): The relevant implementation measures are being prepared in parallel to this proposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary impact shall be exclusively limited to the revenue side. The amounts are estimated at EUR 1.3 million per year. The method used for calculation of revenues: unit value of average similar trade imports for years 2012-2014 multiplied by the new tariff rate quotas volumes multiplied by the in-quota rate duty (20%) minus 25% deduction for collection costs. For subsequent years, the unit value has been considered as constant."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed by an Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The proposed new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. It fully preserves the content of the acts and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Prohibition of exports and imports : the proposed Regulation prohibits exports and imports of goods (listed in Annex II of the Regulation) which have no practical use other than capital punishment or torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It also prohibits a supplier of technical assistance or a broker from supplying or offering such goods to third countries. Furthermore, it prohibit both the promotion of such goods in trade fairs or exhibitions in the Union, and the sale or purchase of advertising space in print media or on the Internet and of advertising time on television or radio in relation to such goods. Obligation of an export licence : for goods which may be used to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (listed in Annex III to the Regulation) or to inflict capital punishment (listed in Annex IV to the Regulation), an export authorisation is required, irrespective of the provenance of the goods. The competent authority shall not grant an authorisation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the goods could be used for the above purposes. Authorisations : authorisations for export, import or transit shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex VII. Authorisations concerning brokering services shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex VIII. Authorisations concerning technical assistance shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex IX. Such authorisations shall be valid throughout the Union. The period of validity of an authorisation shall be from three to twelve months with a possible extension of up to twelve months. The period of validity of a global authorisation shall be from one year to three years with a possible extension of up to two years. The Regulation allows competent authorities to refuse to grant an authorisation and to cancel, suspend, modify or withdraw an authorisation they have already granted. The competent authorities, acting in accordance with this Regulation, may refuse to grant an authorisation and may annul, suspend, modify or revoke an authorisation which they have already granted. If no authorisation has been granted, the authorities shall detain the goods declared and shall make the exporter or importer aware of the possibility to apply for an authorisation. If no application for an authorisation is made within six months of the detention, or if the competent authority dismisses such an application, the customs authorities shall dispose of the detained goods in accordance with applicable national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union’s economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aiming to amend Directive 2008/98/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators, Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets ‘fit for purpose’; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction – more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Directive 2008/98/EC responds to the legal obligation to review the waste management targets in that Directive to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy. The main points are as follows: Alignment of definitions : it is proposed to include in Directive 2008/98/EC definitions of municipal waste, construction and demolition waste, the final recycling process, and backfilling so that the scope of these concepts is clarified. The definition of municipal waste should be in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It is neutral with regard to the public or private status of the operator managing waste. Economic measures : Member States should put in place adequate incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, in particular, by means of financial incentives aimed at achieving the waste prevention and recycling objectives of this Directive, such as landfill and incineration charges, pay as you throw schemes, extended producer responsibility schemes and incentives for local authorities. Waste or non-waste status : the proposal establishes at the Union level harmonised conditions for substances or objects to be recognised as by-products and for waste that has undergone a recovery operation to be recognised as having ceased to be waste. Producer responsibility schemes : given that the effectiveness of these schemes differ significantly between Member States, the proposal sets minimum operating requirements for extended producer responsibility. Those requirements should: define in a clear way the roles and responsibilities of producers of products placing goods on the market of the Union; define measurable waste management targets, in line with the waste hierarchy, aiming to attain at least the quantitative targets relevant for the scheme as laid down in the Directive; establish a reporting system to gather data on the products placed on the Union market by the producers subject to extended producer responsibility. Waste prevention : Member States should: encourage the use of products that are resource efficient, durable, reparable and recyclable; target products that are the main sources of raw materials of a high importance to the economy of the Union and whose supply is associated with a high risk to prevent that those materials become waste; encourage the setting up of systems promoting reuse activities, including in particular for electrical and electronic equipment, textiles and furniture; reduce waste generation in processes related to industrial production, extraction of minerals and construction and demolition, taking into account best available techniques; monitor and assess the implementation of the waste prevention measures. Prevention of food waste : Member States should take measures to promote prevention of food waste in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, and in particular its target of halving food waste by 2030. These measures should aim to prevent food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households. Member States should establish specific food waste prevention measures and should measure progress in food waste reduction. Re-use and recycling : Member States shall take measures: to promote preparing for re-use activities, notably by encouraging the establishment of and support for re-use and repair networks and by facilitating the access of such networks to waste collection points, and by promoting the use of economic instruments, procurement criteria, quantitative objectives or other measures; promote high quality recycling and set up separate collection of waste where technically, environmentally and economically practicable. Municipal waste : the proposal provides for an increase in the targets of preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste, from 60% until 2025 to 65% in 2030. Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of these targets. In the event of an extension, the Member State shall take the necessary measures to increase the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste to a minimum of 50% and 60% by weight, by 2025 and 2030 respectively. Bio-waste : Member States should ensure the separate collection of bio-waste where technically, environmentally and economically practicable. They should encourage the recycling, including composting, and digestion of bio-waste, the treatment of bio-waste in a way that achieves a high level of environmental protection. The proposal also provides for: the adoption of improved and simplified definitions and uniform calculation methods for recycling throughout the EU; the establishment of common rules for reporting in order to ensure the reliability of data gathered for recycling; introduction of an Early Warning System for monitoring compliance with the recycling targets; simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current health security framework, established by Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health, provides a limited legal framework for EU level coordination, based essentially on a) an early warning system (EWRS) and the exchange of information and cooperation within the HSC. Early lessons learnt have shown that the current system has not allowed an optimal response at EU level to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structures and mechanisms under the Decision, while key in facilitating the exchange of information on the evolution of the pandemic and in supporting the adoption of national measures, could do little to trigger a timely common EU level response, co-ordinate the crucial aspects of risk communication, or ensure solidarity among Member States. The revision of the health security framework proposes a stronger and more comprehensive legal basis for the EU to prepare and respond to health crises. In addition, the proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to enhance the roles of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). CONTENT: the overarching aim of the proposed regulation is to provide a strengthened framework for health crisis preparedness and response at EU level by addressing the weaknesses exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it would: set out a comprehensive legislative framework to govern action at EU level on preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, and early warning and responses; and enhance the EU’s guidance in the adoption of common measures at EU level to face a future cross-border health threat. The proposal aims to provide EU added value through the development of an EU health crisis and pandemic preparedness plan, complemented by: national plans and transparent reporting of capacities; strengthened, integrated surveillance systems at EU level supported by improved data collection tools and artificial intelligence, environmental surveillance, to detect early signals of a possible threat; enhanced risk assessment for health threats; increased power to enforce a coordinated response at EU level through the Health Security Committee; and an improved mechanism for recognition of and response to public health emergencies. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications are related mainly to the following objectives: preparedness plans established at EU and national level accompanied by reporting and auditing; training programmes for specialists; digitalised, integrated surveillance system at EU level, better detection of early signals for accurate risk assessment and response; establishment of new EU networks of laboratories; reinforcement of risk assessments for chemical, environmental and climate threats; and established structure and processes for the recognition of emergency at EU level."

BACKGROUND: since 2007 the Community has streamlined its geographical cooperation with developing countries in Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America and with Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and South Africa under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI). The scope of cooperation for the geographic programmes with developing countries, territories and regions established under the Regulation is furthermore limited materially to financing measures to eradicate poverty through the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is in the Community’s interests to further deepen its relations with the developing countries concerned, which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral for a (e.g. Brazil, India or China). It therefore needs a financial instrument that allows the financing of such measures which, by their nature, do not qualify as Official Development Assistance. For that purpose, four Preparatory Actions were set up in the 2007 and 2008 budget procedures to initiate enhanced cooperation in business and scientific exchanges with countries in Asia and Latin America. It is however necessary to provide a legal basis for this specific type of cooperation in order to formalise these exchanges with high-income group countries. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers 4 policy options: 1) No EU action: cooperation with the countries concerned remains strictly in the framework of the DCI regulation; 2) amend DCI Regulation: add an additional strand to the regulation to finance ‘non-ODA activities’ with a ring-fenced amount; 3) amend ICI Regulation: extend the geographical scope of the regulation to DCI countries with a ring-fenced amount; 4) table a new instrument. The different options have been analyzed on the criteria of coherence, efficiency and effectiveness. Option 1 is not considered a valid option in view of the need to fill the legislative gap. Option 2 would be the most coherent, but it is not recommended as it would bring different objectives under the same regulation: eradicating poverty and fostering Community interests. In conclusion, Option 3 is considered the most appropriate and effective legislative option in view of the major simplification of the financial instruments. CONTENT: the proposal thus intends to extend the geographical scope of the countries covered by the DCI Regulation which was initially set up for industrialised and high-income countries. The primary objective of cooperation shall be to provide a specific response to the need to strengthen links and to engage further with them on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis in order to create a more favourable environment for the development of the relations of the Community with these countries and territories and promote dialogue while fostering Community's interests. It shall be aimed at engaging with partners which share similar political, economic and institutional structures and values to the Community and which are important bilateral partners and players in multilateral fora and in global governance. Two annexes have therefore been included in the Regulation: Annex I (existing) covering industrialised and other high-income countries and territories ; Annex II (new) covering DCI developing countries (46 countries). Furthermore, in duly justified circumstances and in order to foster regional cooperation, the Commission may decide when adopting action programmes that countries not listed in the Annexes are eligible, where the project or programme to be implemented is of regional or cross-border nature. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: additional appropriations are requested for this new type of cooperation – corresponding to the continuation of the 2007 to 2008 preparatory actions. As a result, although the financial envelope amounts to EUR 176 million, the budgetary impact is EUR 67.5 million from 2010 to 2013 to cover activities relating to the follow-up of these actions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Erasmus programme already enables millions of young Europeans to study, train or learn abroad while broadening their experience and awareness of Europe, and increasing their future chances on the labour market. It is one of the Union's most visible achievements. In its Communication adopted on 2 May 2018, the Commission proposed to put more emphasis on youth in the context of the next multiannual financial framework, notably by doubling the size of the Erasmus+ programme 2014-2020. The resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 14 September 2017 stressed that the future programme should aim to be accessible to all young people and that these higher ambitions should be reflected in an increase in the budget for the next programming period. In a context of rapid and profound changes induced by technological revolution and globalisation, the Commission considers it essential to invest in learning mobility and exchanges within the framework of a significantly reinforced, inclusive and extended programme. The ambition for the next programme goes hand in hand with the Commission's vision to work towards a European Education Area by 2025 empowering young people and promoting a European identity through youth, education and culture policies. The programme is one of the funding instruments under the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework aiming at investing in people, social cohesion and values. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Erasmus programme for education, training, youth and sport for the period 2021-2027 which will succeed the Erasmus+ 2014-2020 programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The programme aims to support learning mobility opportunities that contribute to the personal, educational, civic and professional development of individuals. It shall also support cooperation between stakeholders at organisational and policy level with a view to foster inclusion, excellence, creativity and innovation in education, training, youth and sport. Objectives : in particular, the proposed new programme shall: be accessible to a larger number of people : the programme shall support all categories of learners, whether they are in higher education, general education, vocational education or training, adult education, non-formal learning, youth and active participation activities. The goal is to triple the number of participants; a broader focus on people from all social backgrounds : the programme shall further facilitate the participation of people with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as EU citizens living in remote areas. Mobility opportunities for students, people in vocational training, apprentices and young people should be extended; help Europeans to acquire new skills : the programme shall support activities to equip citizens with the necessary knowledge, skills and competences, including language skills, in a lifelong learning perspective. It shall pay greater attention to digital skills and future-oriented areas such as climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analysis, arts/design, etc. address a wider target group both within and beyond the EU : mobility and cooperation with third countries shall be enhanced through a combination of physical and virtual mobility and the use of more flexible learning mobility formats to meet the needs of certain target groups, such as adult learners. The programme shall also facilitate the participation of small scale and grassroots organisations; promote a European identity : the programme shall encourage youth participation in Europe’s democratic life by raising awareness about common European values, including fundamental rights, bringing together young people and decision-makers at local, national and EU level and contribute to the European integration process. A new initiative called DiscoverEU shall give young people the opportunity to discover other EU countries. The programme would also contribute to promoting common European values through sport, good governance and integrity in sport; strengthen the Union's relations with the rest of the world : intensify international mobility and cooperation with third countries - in particular enlargement, neighbourhood, industrialised and emerging countries - in order to support institutions and organisations in Europe in facing the challenges of globalisation. Key actions : the proposal defines specific objectives for each of the three action areas of the programme (education and training, youth and sport). Each of these three areas would be structured around three key actions: ‘learning mobility’ (key action 1); ‘cooperation among organisations and institutions’ (key action 2) and ‘support to policy development and cooperation’ (key action 3). In order to simplify requirements for beneficiaries, it is proposed to use simplified grants in the form of lump-sums, unit-costs and flat-rate funding should be used to the maximum possible extent. The future Erasmus monitoring and evaluation framework shall follow an approach based on continuous monitoring to assess the progress towards achieving the output and results targets of the programme. Proposed budget : EUR 30 billion for the period 2021-2027, according to the following indicative breakdown: EUR 24.94 billion for actions in the field of education and training; EUR 3.10 billion for actions in the youth field; EUR 550 million for actions in the field of sport; and at least EUR 960 million as a contribution to the operating costs of the national agencies."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to conclusion of the agreement. The ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013) allowed for the consultation of Eurodac by law enforcement authorities for the purpose of prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. Since 2004, the Agreement between the European Community and the Switzerland concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland also covers the application of the ‘Dublin-related’ parts of Eurodac. This is also the case for Liechtenstein since 2008. However, law enforcement access, which was a new element of the ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation compared to the original Eurodac regime (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) has not been regulated so far by the said Agreement. Therefore, Members called on the European Parliament to give its consent to the extension of the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to Switzerland and Liechtenstein which would enable the law enforcement authorities of Switzerland and Liechtenstein to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data entered by other participating States and stored in the Eurodac database when they seek to establish the identity or get further information concerning a person who is suspected of a serious crime or terrorism or concerning a victim."

BACKGROUND: in accordance with the Decision of the Council of 14 May 2012, a Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part, was signed on 30 April 2013, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Agreement should now be approved on behalf of the European Union. The PCA will supersede the current legal framework of the 1993 Agreement on trade and economic cooperation between the European Economic Community and Mongolia. The Commission notes that following the 11 June 2014 ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-377/12 Commission v Council regarding the Council Decision on the signature of the PCA with the Philippines, this proposal should be based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, it is proposed that the Council approve, on behalf of the Union, the Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part. Shared principles: the PCA is testimony to the growing importance of EU-Mongolia relations based on shared principles such as equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It includes the EU’s standard political clauses on human rights, weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), the International Criminal Court (ICC), small arms and light weapons (SALWs) and counter-terrorism, and promotes bilateral, regional and international cooperation. Concrete cooperation: the PCA will allow the EU to assume greater responsibility and influence in the region, and to promote European values and provide the basis for more effective engagement by the EU and its Member States with Mongolia. It strengthens political, economic and sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, including trade and investment, development, justice, freedom and security. It encompasses areas such as: Institutional framework: the draft Agreement comprises institutional measures establishing a Joint Committee, composed of representatives of both sides at an appropriate high level, whose tasks shall be to ensure the proper functioning and implementation of this Agreement.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 196) was signed by the Union on 22 October 2015, subject to its conclusion. Article 23 of the Convention provides that the latter is open for the approval of the European Union. Following the sixth ratification, of which four were by Member States of the Council of Europe, Convention No. 196 came into force on 1 June 2007. As of 21 February 2017, 23 EU Member States have ratified the Convention, and all EU Member States have signed it. In view of the continuing threat of terrorism to fundamental rights and the global nature of terrorism, the European Union must act united to promote and uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law in Europe. Given the global nature of terrorism, a common understanding of terrorist and terrorism-related offences, complemented with provisions to facilitate cooperation between national authorities as laid down in Convention No. 196 contributes to further enhancing the effectiveness of the criminal justice instruments and cooperation at Union and international level. The Union has already adopted measures in the different areas covered by Convention No. 196 on the basis of provisions of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. With the adoption of the Directive on combating terrorism, the European Union is ready to complete its commitment to be a party to the Additional Protocol by conclusion of that instrument. This can only be done by concluding Convention No. 196, at the latest simultaneously with conclusion of its Additional Protocol. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the decision to conclude Convention No. 196 on behalf of the Union. It must be read together with a proposal concerning a decision to conclude the Additional Protocol (Convention No. 217) that supplements the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (Convention No. 196). Objectives of the Convention: Convention No. 196 defines criminal offences related to terrorism, an area for which the Union has competence under Article 83(1) TFEU. It covers areas to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, including the setting of minimum rules for the definition of criminal offences in the area of terrorism, as well as police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The purpose of Convention No. 196 is to enhance the efforts of the parties in preventing terrorism and its negative effects on the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular the right to life, both by measures taken at national level and through international co-operation. It thus criminalises the following acts when committed intentionally: In addition, the Convention: Convention No. 196 also contains several provisions aiming at strengthening international co-operation in criminal matters through mutual legal assistance, including spontaneous exchange of information and extradition, being subject to a non-discrimination clause. An Additional Protocol (Convention No. 217) was adopted by the Council of Europe on 19 May 2015. The Additional Protocol supplements Convention No. 196 and came into force on 1 July 2017. It is not possible to be a party to the Additional Protocol without also being a party to Convention No. 1963. The European Union has signed Convention No. 196, as well as its Additional Protocol. Territorial application: Convention No. 196 signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark. Convention No. 196 signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in the United Kingdom only insofar as this Member State notifies the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument. Ireland is bound by Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and is therefore to take part in the adoption of this Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/20076 has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity. A codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it, fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also necessary to make certain substantive amendments to that Regulation in order to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts and to adapt the rules on the exceptional measures with limited territorial application. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast. Purpose of the Regulation : to recall, this Regulation applies the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements. It shall apply to products originating in the regions and states listed in Annex I. It calls for more favourable access to the EU market rules for a number of products defined in the Regulation (notably the elimination of import duties on the Community market if they originate from regions or states listed in Annex I of the Regulation). Such elimination shall be subject to the general safeguards mechanisms. The Regulation also sets the rules for defining the origin of the products from the regions or States concerned. However, these measures are subject to changes under the present proposal. Exceptional measures with limited territorial application : the Commission may, after having examined alternative solutions, authorise the application of surveillance or safeguard measures restricted to the Member State or Member States concerned if it considers that such measures applied at that level are more appropriate than measures applied throughout the Union. Those measures must be strictly limited in time and must disrupt the operation of the internal market as little as possible. Delegated acts : according to the proposal, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adding an Annex to this Regulation which sets out the regime applicable to products originating in South Africa once the relevant trade provisions of the TDCA have been superseded by the relevant provisions of an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, an Economic Partnership Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations - which will replace current Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 - contains new rules regarding, inter alia, the funding of political parties and political foundations at European level. Their effectiveness requires that they are accompanied by a corresponding set of financial rules anchored in the Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012). The proposal follows the European Parliament resolution of 6 April 2011 regarding the financing of the European political parties which considers that, in light of the experience gained, the financing of European political parties and European political foundations should be improved as regards a number of points. In particular, it calls for an end to the system of grants and the creation of a new financing instrument in the Financial Regulation “devoted solely and tailored specifically to the funding of European Parties and foundations”. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: after a detailed analysis, it is proposed that political parties should indeed be financed through a new instrument (""contributions"") rather than through an operating grant, as it is currently the case. As regards European political foundations, it is considered that they should continue to receive an operating grant. The Commission feels that the request of the European Parliament to exclude European political foundations also from the grant system is not justified given that the specific characteristics of European political parties are not the same as the European political foundations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof. CONTENT: the Commission proposal establishes a new Title VIII be inserted in part Two of the Financial Regulation dedicated to Contributions to European political parties and it repeals the specific provisions regarding European political parties which are currently provided for under Title VI (grants) of part One. The proposal introduces the following elements: Abolition of the ""annual work programme"": in accordance with Parliament’s resolution, the payment of contributions shall not be a precondition for the presentation of an annual work programme and an estimated operating budget. Introduction of eligibility criteria: the authorising officer should request directly from the Registry of European political parties (set up in the EP) certificates confirming that European political parties are duly registered and are in compliance with relevant obligations (e.g. presentation of accounts) and have not been suspended or subject to any administrative penalty as foreseen in the proposal for a Regulation on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations. Abolition of the selection criteria: the selection criteria will not be required in the new Title, since there is little value in verifying the financial and operational capacity of European political parties to represent its citizens, a fortiori when no annual work programme or estimated budget is submitted. Control on their statutory obligations: a provision has been introduced which will explicitly require that European political parties should not be subject to debarment from the Registry or subject to an administrative penalty during the financial year covered by the contribution. In such cases, their contributions would be reduced or terminated and any pre-financing paid recovered. The authorising officer should request such confirmation to the EP Registry before making the payment of the balance. Controls on expenditure and not on actions: while financial support should be awarded without an annual work programme and estimated operating budget, European political parties should justify ex post the sound use of Union funds. In particular, the authorising officer should verify if the EU funds have been used to pay reimbursable expenditure as established in the call for contributions within the time limits laid down in this Regulation. Time limits to use of EU funds: Parliament called for the possibility to 'build up reserves and carry-over of funds'. The new Title does not prevent European political parties from building reserves from their own sources. In addition, European political parties should also benefit from a certain flexibility regarding the time limits to use the EU funds awarded. However, EU funds that have not been spent should be used within a reasonable time. Financing and pre-financing methods: as in the case of grants, contributions may be paid either through the reimbursement of a percentage of the expenditures incurred or through a system of predefined lump sum, unit costs, and flat rate (forfaits). Contributions should be paid in one pre-financing payment covering 100% of the sum, unless the authorising officer decides otherwise for duly justified reasons. Interest on pre-financing: by derogation from the Financial Regulation, any interest yielded by the pre-financing amounts received by the European political parties should be used to pay reimbursable expenditures within the following two financial years. Penalty and control regime: as in the case for grants, the new Title should include the standard provisions regarding the control of the EP, OLAF, and the Court of Auditors. It should also include the same penalty regime (administrative and financial penalties) which is applicable to grant beneficiaries. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the envisaged modification of the Financial Regulation has no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Morocco, of the other part entered into force on 1 March 2000. Liberalisation measures on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products were introduced into the Association Agreement by an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco (the Liberalisation Agreement), which entered into force in 2012. Since the Association Agreement entered into force, the Union has continued to strengthen its bilateral relations with Morocco and awarded it advanced status in 2008 which enshrines the strength of the bilateral links between the parties and their shared ambitions and commitments with a view to the advancement of their joint initiatives, such as good governance and political and socio-economic reforms. At the same time, the Union has consistently reaffirmed its commitment to resolving the dispute in Western Sahara. Although it has not recognised Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, it fully supports the efforts made by the United Nations Secretary-General and his personal envoy to help the parties reach a fair, lasting and mutually-acceptable political solution that would ensure the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara under agreements aligned with the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in the Resolutions of the UN Security Council, in particular Resolutions 2152 (2014) and 2218 (2015). In its judgment of 21 December 2016 in Case C-104/16 P3, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the Association Agreement and the Liberalisation Agreement between the Union and Morocco did not apply to Western Sahara. Following the Court judgment, the practice of applying the trade preferences set out in the Association Agreement and its protocols on a de facto basis to products originating in Western Sahara, a non-self-governing territory, could not continue, unless Protocol 1 (access to the EU market for Moroccan agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products) and Protocol 4 (concerning rules of origin) were amended to establish that products originating in Western Sahara should be treated in the same way as those from Morocco. On 29 May 2017, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Morocco with a view to establishing a legal basis to grant the tariff preferences laid down in the Association Agreement to products originating in Western Sahara. An agreement between the EU and Morocco is the only means of ensuring that the import of products originating in Western Sahara benefits from preferential origin, given that only the Moroccan authorities are able to ensure compliance with the rules necessary for the granting of such preferences. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on the amendment of Protocols 1 and 4 to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Morocco, of the other part. This proposal applies amendments to Protocol 4 and Protocol 1 of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement with a view to respecting the obligations of the Court judgment of 21 December 2016 and providing a legal basis for granting preferences to products from Western Sahara. The aim of the proposal is to: These measures will prevent Western Sahara suffering a competitive disadvantage and missing out on investment opportunities compared with neighbouring countries, which benefit from tariff preferences on different grounds (association agreements or the Generalised System of Preferences). Lastly, it should be emphasised that the judgment delivered by the Court of Justice on 27 February 2018 in Case C-266/16 relates to the partnership agreement between the EU and Morocco in the fishing industry. This is a separate issue from the matter of market access, which is covered by the Association Agreement and therefore this proposal. Any agreement is understood to be purely provisional, pending the resolution of the dispute through the UN and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. On this point, the Agreement states that it is concluded without prejudice to the respective positions of the European Union and Morocco with regard to the status of Western Sahara."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current health security framework, established by Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health, provides a limited legal framework for EU level coordination, based essentially on a) an early warning system (EWRS) and the exchange of information and cooperation within the HSC. Early lessons learnt have shown that the current system has not allowed an optimal response at EU level to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structures and mechanisms under the Decision, while key in facilitating the exchange of information on the evolution of the pandemic and in supporting the adoption of national measures, could do little to trigger a timely common EU level response, co-ordinate the crucial aspects of risk communication, or ensure solidarity among Member States. The revision of the health security framework proposes a stronger and more comprehensive legal basis for the EU to prepare and respond to health crises. In addition, the proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to enhance the roles of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). CONTENT: the overarching aim of the proposed regulation is to provide a strengthened framework for health crisis preparedness and response at EU level by addressing the weaknesses exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it would: set out a comprehensive legislative framework to govern action at EU level on preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, and early warning and responses; and enhance the EU’s guidance in the adoption of common measures at EU level to face a future cross-border health threat. The proposal aims to provide EU added value through the development of an EU health crisis and pandemic preparedness plan, complemented by: national plans and transparent reporting of capacities; strengthened, integrated surveillance systems at EU level supported by improved data collection tools and artificial intelligence, environmental surveillance, to detect early signals of a possible threat; enhanced risk assessment for health threats; increased power to enforce a coordinated response at EU level through the Health Security Committee; and an improved mechanism for recognition of and response to public health emergencies. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications are related mainly to the following objectives: preparedness plans established at EU and national level accompanied by reporting and auditing; training programmes for specialists; digitalised, integrated surveillance system at EU level, better detection of early signals for accurate risk assessment and response; establishment of new EU networks of laboratories; reinforcement of risk assessments for chemical, environmental and climate threats; and established structure and processes for the recognition of emergency at EU level."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation providing for the continuation of the Pericles programme in the post-2020 multiannual financial framework. Article 139 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that measures governing the use of the euro referred to in Article 133 thereof shall not apply to the Member States with derogation. However, the exchange of information and staff and the assistance and training measures implemented under the Pericles programme should be uniform throughout the Union. The Commission recalled the significant role of non-participating Member States under the current extension of the Pericles 2020 programme. The National bank of Croatia, for instance, organised a series of conferences under the title ‘Balkan network for euro protection’ gathering experts from South East Europe to reinforce the protection of the euro against counterfeiting in this area, known for its distribution and production of euro counterfeits. The Commission therefore considered it necessary to take the necessary measures to ensure the same level of protection for the euro in the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency. CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the Regulation establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (Pericles IV) to the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the fisheries partnership Agreement between the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire and the European Community entered into force on 18 April 2008. The previous Protocol to the Agreement entered into force on 1 July 2013 and expired on 30 June 2018. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Côte d’Ivoire with a view to concluding a new Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Côte d’Ivoire. Following those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 16 March 2018. It shall cover a period of six years from the date of its provisional application. It is now necessary for this Protocol to be approved on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol on the implementation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire (2018-2024). The main objective of the Protocol is to enable the European Union and the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire to work more closely together on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy, sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Côte d’Ivoire waters, and Côte d’Ivoire's efforts to develop a blue economy. It also aims to provide fishing opportunities for Union vessels in Côte d’Ivoire waters, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and following the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: Joint committee: the partnership Agreement establishes the joint committee responsible for monitoring its implementation. Furthermore, in accordance with the Protocol, this joint committee may approve certain amendments to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of such amendments, the Commission should be empowered, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fishery and aquaculture sector has been particularly hard hit by the market disruption generated by a significant drop in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis can consequently have dramatic socio-economic consequences in certain communities where fishing and aquaculture play a key role. Small-scale coastal fisheries represent close to 75% of all active vessels and over 55% of direct employment; they constitute the main economic activity in many coastal areas. On 13 March 2020, the Commission proposed a ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’ directed at promoting investments by mobilising available cash reserves in the European Structural and Investments Funds, to fight the crisis immediately. However, the fact that fishing and aquaculture activities have been interrupted or significantly reduced makes it difficult to implement the current operational measures and programmes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) in a normal way. In the absence of effective measures to tackle the crisis, the EMFF is unlikely to be fully implemented by the end of the current programming period. The Commission considers that it should be possible for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) established by Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 to support specific measures until 31 December 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (EMFF Regulation) and Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 (CMO Regulation) in order to introduce specific measures under the EMFF to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Specific measures The amendments to the EMFF are intended to allow a more flexible redistribution of financial resources within operational programmes in each Member State and a simplified procedure for amending operational programmes as regards the introduction of new measures. The proposed specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector comprise: - support to fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to aquaculture farmers for the temporary suspension or the reduction of production caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to producer organisations and associations of producer organisations for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products, in accordance with the Common Market Organisation (CMO). It is proposed that these measures are retroactively eligible as of 1 February 2020 and available until 31 December 2020. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the EMFF remains unchanged. The available payment appropriations in the 2020 budget for the EMFF can accommodate a shift between Union Priorities within operational programmes. The new measures will in fact to a large extent replace initially planned initiatives, which are now being stopped due to the general decline of economic activity. By consequence, the proposed measures aim to ensure an effective implementation of the 2020 budget and the 2014-2020 allocation for the EMFF."

Council Regulation. the current patent system in the EU, in particular in terms of translation requirements, involves very high costs and complexity. The overall cost of validation of an average European patent reaches 12 500 EUR if validated only in 13 Member States and over 32 000 EUR if validated in the whole EU. It is estimated that the actual validation costs are around 193 million EUR per year in the EU. Despite broad recognition of the competitive disadvantage European business faces in the absence of unitary patent protection, the Union has not been able to establish unitary patent protection. The Commission first proposed a Council Regulation on the Community patentin August 2000. On 30 June 2010 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the EU patent. It was confirmed at the Competitiveness Council meeting on 10 December 2010 that insurmountable difficulties existed, making a decision requiring unanimity impossible now and in the foreseeable future. 25 Member States then asked for recourse enhanced cooperation in the area of unitary patent protection (all Member States except Italy and Spain) in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection. was adopted by the Council, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, on 10 March 2011. The present regulation implements the enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection as authorised by Council Decision 2011/167/EU.. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment which analyses the impacts of the following options: Option 1 (base-line scenario): the Commission takes no action; Option 2 : the Commission continues to work with the other institutions towards an EU patent covering 27 Member States; Option 3 : the Commission presents proposals for regulations implementing enhanced cooperation: Sub-option 3.1 - the Commission proposes translation arrangements applicable in the area of unitary patent protection that correspond to its proposal of 30 June 2010, or Sub-option 3.2 - the Commission proposes translation arrangements applicable in the area of unitary patent protection based on its proposal of 30 June 2010 and incorporating elements of a compromise proposal discussed by the Council. The analysis carried out in the impact assessment has demonstrated that option 3 with sub-option 3.2 is the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 118 (1) TFEU provides for the legal basis for creating European intellectual property rights providing uniform protection throughout the Union by means of a regulation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. CONTENT: the proposal aims to implement enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection authorised by Council Decision No 2011/167/EU. The main provisions are as follows : European patent with unitary effect : in comparison to the Commission's proposal in 2000, this proposal builds on the existing system of European patents by providing unitary effect to European patents granted for the territories of the participating Member States. The unitary patent protection will be optional and co-exist with national and European patents. The proprietors of European patents granted by the EPO, may submit a request to the EPO within one month after the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent, asking for the registration of the unitary effect. Once it is registered, the unitary effect will provide uniform protection and will have equal effect throughout the territories of all participating Member States. European patents with unitary effect may only be granted, transferred, revoked or may lapse in respect of those territories as a whole. The participating Member States shall give the task of administrating European patents with unitary effect to the EPO. Rights and limitations : the rights conferred by the European patent with unitary effect should enable the patent proprietor to prevent any third party not having his consent from the direct and indirect use of the invention on the territories of the participating Member States. However, a number of limitations of the patent proprietor's rights should enable third parties to use the invention, for instance for private and for non-commercial purposes, for experimental purposes, for acts allowed specifically under Union law (in the area of veterinary medicinal products, medicinal products for human use, plant variety rights, the legal protection of computer programs by copyright and the legal protection of biotechnological inventions) under international law and for the use by a farmer of protected livestock for farming purposes. Treating a European patent with unitary effect as a national patent : a European patent with unitary effect shall be dealt with in its entirety, and in all the participating Member States, as a national patent of the participating Member State in which, according to the European Patent Register, the proprietor of the patent had his residence or principal place of business on the date of filing of the application for the patent. Where no proprietor has his residence or a place of business in a participating Member State, the European patent with unitary effect as an object of property shall be dealt with as a national patent of the State where the European Patent Organisation has its seat. Licenses of right : the draft regulation enables the proprietor of a European patent with unitary effect to file a statement with the EPO that he is prepared to allow any person to use the invention as a licensee in return for appropriate compensation (contractual license). Renewal fees : renewal fees in respect of European patents with unitary effect shall be paid to the European Patent Organisation. If a renewal fee is not been paid in due time, the European patent with unitary effect shall lapse. The proposal provides that renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect shall be progressive throughout the term of the patent and shall be sufficient not only to cover all costs associated with the grant and administration of the unitary patent protection but also, together with the fees to be paid to the European Patent Organisation during the pre-grant stage, to ensure a balanced budget for the Organisation. The share for distributing 50% of the amount of the renewal fees paid for European patents with unitary effect minus the costs associated with the administration of the unitary patent protection among the participating Member States shall be set by the Commission on the basis of fair, equitable and relevant criteria, i.e the number of patent applications and the size of the market. Participating Member States shall use the amount of the renewal fees allocated to them for patent-related purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions delegating to the Commission the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of the level of the renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect and the distribution of such fees between the European Patent Organisation and the participating Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting requires credit institutions, and, within the limits of their payment activity, other payment service providers, and any other institutions engaged in the processing and distribution to the public of notes and coins to ensure that euro notes and coins which they have received and which they intend to put back into circulation are checked for authenticity and that counterfeits are detected. Commission Recommendation 2005/504/EC of 27 May 2005 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation provides for practices regarding authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation. However, the lack of a mandatory common framework for coin authentication results in different practices among Member States and cannot, therefore, ensure a uniform protection of the currency across the Community. In order to achieve an effective and uniform authentication of euro coins throughout the euro area, it is therefore necessary to introduce binding rules for the implementation of common procedures for authentication of the circulating euro coins and of control mechanisms of these procedures by the national authorities. This is the aim of the proposed Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the need for such binding common rules concerning euro coin authentication and unfit euro coins was underlined in the context of the evaluation of the above mentioned Commission Recommendation, carried out in line with its Article 12. This was conducted in collaboration with the Member States, which expressed broad support for the provisions currently proposed. For the purpose of the evaluation, a number of workshops and meetings were organised, also involving representatives of the private sector. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation includes provisions regarding: Authentication of euro coins : the institutions concerned must ensure that euro coin authentication is carried out by means of coin processing equipment capable of detecting counterfeits; or manually, by trained staff. The coin processing equipment is to be adjusted on the basis of a detection test, the modalities of which are defined by the European Technical and Scientific Centre (ETSC). Testing possibilities for these machines shall become available at the Coin National Analysis Centres and at the ETSC and a list of the machines having successfully undergone the test will be published by the Commission. Member States will be responsible for overseeing the functioning of the euro coin authentication system. Handling of unfit euro coins : Member States remove from circulation not only counterfeits but also those genuine euro coins which are no longer fit for circulation. They reimburse those which have been rendered unfit by long circulation or accident but would refuse reimbursement of coins become unfit as a result of manipulation. The designated services in Member States will charge a 5% levy on the value of unfit coins submitted but have the possibility to offer broad exemptions to companies that cooperate closely with the authorities in cleaning the market from counterfeits and unfit coins. Specific packaging will be required for submissions and Member States will destroy the unfit coins removed from circulation. It should also be noted that provision is made for reporting and communication, with a view to presenting to Member States a global view of the relevant activity. The proposed procedures on the euro coins are complementary to the ones proposed by the European Central Bank concerning the detection of counterfeit euro banknotes and their fitness sorting. The proposed provisions are designed for Member States which use the euro as their single currency. This is because euro coin authentication methods, in a less complete form, are already established for non-euro area Member States in the modified Regulation 1338/2001. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) with Vietnam, based on the November 2004 authorisation for negotiations with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Negotiations with Vietnam were launched in Hanoi in November 2007. The PCA was signed in Brussels on 27 June 2012. The PCA with Vietnam will supersede the current legal framework of the 1995 Agreement between the European Community and Vietnam and the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was extended in 1999 to include Vietnam. It is now necessary to approve the PCA on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: the Commission notes that Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA Philippines is the subject of Court Case C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul this Decision insofar as the Council had added legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100 TFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4) TFEU). Council Decision No 2012/279/EU on the signature of the PCA Vietnam raises, mutatis mutandis, the same legal issues as Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA Philippines. Court Case C-377/12 is therefore of relevance to the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA with Vietnam too. Subject to the Court ruling in Case-377/12, this proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA Vietnam is based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6). The PCA draws the attention of the Council to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of the UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The addition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on the outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice, this recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The Commission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure for conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Viet Nam, of the other part. General principles and political dialogue: the PCA with Vietnam constitutes an important step towards enhanced political and economic involvement of the EU in South-East Asia. Foreign policy: the draft PCA covers the EU’s standard political clauses on: It also addresses legal cooperation, money laundering and terrorist financing, organised crime and corruption, and covers areas of particular interest to Vietnam such as cooperation on human rights and the rule of law, remnants of war and natural disaster prevention. Economic and trade cooperation: the draft PCA provides the basis for more effective engagement by the EU and its Member States with Vietnam in the development, trade and economic fields and will facilitate the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Vietnam. The conclusion of the PCA is in line with the EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and political framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries. Sectoral cooperation: the PCA strengthens the sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, such as: Institutional framework: the draft Agreement also includes institutional provisions to put in place a joint committee composed of representatives of the two Parties with the aim of ensuring the correct application of the Agreement and resolving conflicts."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 83/417/EEC provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption. Since the entry into force of that Directive several changes have taken place, notably the development of a comprehensive legal framework in the area of food law and the adoption of an international standard by the Codex Alimentarius for edible casein products, which need to be taken into account. Directive 83/417/EEC confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, those powers need to be aligned to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the Treaty) which allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. For the sake of clarity, Directive 83/417/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced with a new Directive CONTENT: the proposal is aimed at designing the Commission's empowerment in the new legal context created by the Lisbon Treaty. It also takes account of the further development of legislation in the past years and of existing, updated international standards. The proposal: identifies the need for delegated power to be conferred on the Commission for the purpose of adopting amendments to Annexes I and II and establishes the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts in the new legal context determined by the entry into force of Articles 290 and 291 of the TFEU; adapts existing provisions to the further development of legislation notably in the field of food law; adjust, where appropriate, the composition requirements of edible caseins to the corresponding Codex standard . This adjustment results in two changes: the maximum moisture content of edible casein is increased from 10 to 12% and the maximum milk fat content of edible acid casein is decreased from 2.25 to 2%. With this change, the compositional requirements laid down in the proposal are fully in line with the international standard so as to avoid trade distortions. Moreover the proposal takes into consideration the need for the Member States to have some margin to adapt the implementation to the national legal and administrative environment, in particular with reference to the possible adoption of national measures in matters not specifically harmonised by the proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation on summer-time arrangements was first introduced in 1980 with the objective of unifying existing national summer-time practices and schedules. Since 2001, EU summer-time arrangements have been governed by Directive 2000/84/EC setting out the obligation on all Member States to switch to summer-time on the last Sunday of March and to switch back to their standard time (""winter-time"") on the last Sunday of October. The system of bi-annual clock changes has been increasingly questioned, by citizens, by the European Parliament, and by a growing number of Member States. In its resolution of 8 February 2018, Parliament asked the Commission to carry out an assessment of summer-time arrangements as provided for in Directive 2000/84/EC and, where appropriate, to submit a proposal for revision. The Commission has also carried out a public consultation, which generated around 4.6 million replies, of which 84% were in favour of discontinuing the bi-annual clock changes while 16% wanted to keep them. Against this background, the Commission considers that the arrangements for summer time should be terminated in a coordinated manner in order to avoid any major disruption to the internal market caused by divergences between Member States in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the evidence available on the effects of the EU summer-time arrangements, the conclusion can be drawn that a continued harmonised regime – whereby all Member States abolish the bi-annual time changes – would remain beneficial for the functioning of the internal market. Effects on other areas are rather inconclusive and are likely to depend on the geographical location and whether Member States choose to stay with permanent summer- or permanent winter-time. The impact of this choice therefore needs to be assessed at national level. A change of system will also bring about transition costs that should be considered. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to end seasonal changes in European time from 2019 onwards, while leaving the Member States free to decide whether to permanently apply summer time or winter time. Directive 2000/84/EC will be repealed. Member States wishing to return permanently to winter time may make a final change of seasonal time on Sunday 27 October 2019 (at 01.00 in the morning). From this date, seasonal time changes will no longer be possible. Member States remain free to make changes to their standard time that are not linked to seasonal changes. In order to avoid disturbances Member States should inform the Commission of their intention to change their standard time 6 months before changes take effect. Given that the Member States will have to apply Directive as from 1 April 2019, the Directive provides that each Member State must, by 27 April 2019 at the latest, on the basis of possible consultations and assessments at national level and in concertation with other Member States, notify the Commission of its intention to permanently apply a standard time corresponding to their current winter-time, rather than to their current summer-time."

A report adopted by the Commission on the current roaming Regulation indicates that it has temporarily reduced prices for roaming phone calls and text messages but has not remedied the lack of competition in the roaming market, with prices remaining stubbornly close to the retail caps. The Commission's proposal would tackle the current lack of competition and consumer choice by: making it easier for alternative operators, like mobile virtual network operators, to enter roaming markets by requiring network operators in other Member States to give them access to their networks at regulated wholesale prices. This would create more competition between operators on roaming markets, and so increase the incentives for them to offer customers more attractive prices and services; letting consumers choose an alternative provider for roaming services, irrespective of their national provider. Each time the customer crossed a border, they would automatically switch to their chosen roaming provider, without any further action on their part, while keeping the same number and subscriber identity module (SIM card). This would enhance transparency and allow customers to shop around for the best roaming offers and encourage operators to offer more competitive roaming deals. The proposal aims to meet the objective set in the Digital Agenda for Europe that differences between roaming and national telecoms tariffs should approach zero by 2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: to cover the period until structural measures become fully effective and competition drives retail prices down, the proposal would progressively lower current retail price caps on voice and texting (SMS) services and introduce a new retail price cap for mobile data services. By 1 July 2014, roaming consumers would pay no more than: 24 cents per minute to make a call, a maximum 10 cents per minute to receive a call, maximum 10 cents to send a text message and maximum 50 cents per Megabyte (MB) to download data or browse the Internet whilst travelling abroad (charged per Kilobyte used). More specifically, until these structural solutions fully delivered their results the proposal would: introduce a new retail price cap for data roaming (which would remain in force until mid-2016). This would ensure that users of smart phones, tablets and other devices to access the Internet through mobile networks could go online whilst abroad without running up huge bills. The Commission proposes that consumers would pay no more than 90 cents per Megabyte (MB) downloaded from 1 July 2012, falling very steeply to 50 cents per MB by July 2014 (such prices would be charged on a Kilobyte basis, taking into account effective use). The current Regulation does not foresee retail price caps for data roaming. Wholesale price caps for data roaming have been in place since July 2009, but savings have not been passed on to the consumer. The overall average retail price of EUR 1.06 to download data in another Member State at the end of 2010 masks a wide variation in retail prices. For example, it costs consumers an average of EUR 2.23 per MB when downloading abroad on another mobile group's network and in some cases charges reached much higher levels (even as high as EUR 12 per MB). It is important to note that the proposed retail caps serve as a mere safety-net for consumers, while the Commission expects that the proposed competition-enhancing structural measures would deliver innovative pan-European offers and cheaper prices, significantly below the safeguard caps; keep retail price caps for roaming voice and text message (SMS). These would gradually decrease for all roaming services and would also remain in force until mid-2016; keep data roaming ""bill shock"" protection – consumers' and business travellers' monthly bills for data access over mobile networks when abroad would continue to be limited to EUR 50 unless the customer explicitly agreed otherwise; retain caps on wholesale prices between operators for all roaming services until 2022 (voice, SMS and data) in order to create a predictable investment environment for alternative operators. Wholesale price caps could be removed before 2022 if market data indicated that competition had developed sufficiently; under the new Regulation, operators would still be obliged to provide information on roaming prices to consumers when crossing into another Member State, but customers would be able to easily opt out of receiving this information. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Europe Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission recently proposed the creation of a new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion - Progress, designed to give the unemployed the chance of a new start and to open the way to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including the young, in the broader context of the Economic Recovery Plan. The aim of the present proposal is to provide adequate financial assistance for this new instrument by reallocating financial resources from the 2007-2013 Progress Programme. The proposal to reallocate part of the budget will not compromise the objectives of the Progress programme. CONTENT: in line with the Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, this proposal aims to reallocate EUR 100 million needs to be reallocated from the existing budget of the Progress Programme, set up by Decision No 1672/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, to the new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion – Progress. Decision No 1672/2006/EC should be amended accordingly and provides for EUR 643 250 000 from 2007-2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: an additional amount of EUR 114 million (current prices) was allocated to the Progress programme. The total budget for 2007-2013 was therefore increased from EUR 628 800 000 (current prices) in the Commission's initial proposal to EUR 743 250 000 (current prices). After examining all possible options, the Commission proposes to reallocate EUR 100 million from the Progress Programme to the new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion – Progress. This will also require further promoting cross-cutting across policy sections and linkages with other EU instruments, such as transnational cooperation under the European Social Fund or support for social dialogue. Lastly, it will increase the efficiency and consistency of EU action in support of EU objectives and priorities in the areas of employment and social solidarity."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. It is applied by all Member States with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries. The first series of visa waiver agreements were signed on 6 May 2015 (United Arab Emirates), 26 May 2015 (Timor-Leste) and 28 May 2015 (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu) and provisionally apply from the date of signature pending their entry into force. The Council has authorised the signature of a second series of visa waiver agreements with Tonga (signed on 20 November 2015), Colombia (signed on 2 December 2015), Kiribati (date of signature to be determined) and Palau (signed on 7 December 2015). These four agreements provisionally apply from the day following the date of signature pending their entry into force. The negotiations with Solomon Islands were opened on 19 November 2014. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators in Brussels on 13 November 2015. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Solomon Islands on the short-stay visa waiver. The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Solomon Islands when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Solomon Islands to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Solomon Islands may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For those travelling to carry out a paid activity, each Member State and also Solomon Islands remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. A joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Solomon Islands to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. A joint declaration on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis is annexed to the agreement. Lastly, the Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: s tandards and standardisation are very effective policy tools for the EU. They are used as policy instruments to ensure, inter alia, the functioning of the single market of products, the interoperability of networks and systems, in particular in the field of ICT, a high level of consumer and environmental protection, and more innovation and social inclusion. This proposal addresses three major problems: 1. In a rapidly changing world and society, especially in sectors characterised by very short product lives and development cycles, standards must keep pace with rapid technological development. Some stakeholders argue that the entire process of creating European standards developed at the request of the Commission is too slow. 2. SMEs encounter a series of problems with respect to standards and standardisation. One of the most important problems, according to many stakeholders, is that SMEs are in general under-represented in standardisation activities, in particular at European level. 3. In the field of ICT, many standards ensuring interoperability are not elaborated by the ESOs but by other organisations that develop standards (hereinafter ""global fora and consortia""). Concrete examples are Internet and World Wide Web related standards. At the moment, referring to ""Fora and Consortia Standards"" in public procurement which is subject to Directive 2004/18/CE is only possible in exceptional circumstances. To respond rapidly to evolving needs in all areas, a comprehensive, inclusive, efficient and technically up-to-date European standardisation system will be required. In its Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the Commission highlighted the necessity to improve the method of standard setting and the use of standards in Europe. On 21 October 2010, the European Parliament adopted a report on the future of European standardisation which indicated that the review of European standardisation should preserve its many successful elements, remedy its deficiencies and strike the right balance between the European, national and international dimensions. In its communication of 13 April 2011 on the ‘Single market Act: Twelve levers to boost growth and confidence', the Commission included among its twelve key priority actions to be adopted by the EU institutions before the end of 2012 the extension of the European standardisation system to services. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission accepted a combination of different options: Options 1.A (deadlines on the delivery of European standards) and 1.C (transparent and simplified procedures for harmonised standards and other European standards requested by the Commission), Option 2.C (strengthen the position of organisations representing SMEs and societal stakeholders within the ESOs by providing for the possibility of an operating grant) and 3.B (referencing of ""Fora and Consortia Standards"" in public procurement) meet the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and consistency. Therefore, these 4 options constitute the basis of this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t his proposal replaces a part of Directive 98/34/EC and repeals Decisions No 1673/2006/EC and 87/95/EEC. It aims to establish rules with regard to: (i) the cooperation between European standardisation bodies, national standardisation bodies and the Commission; (ii) the establishment of European standards and European standardisation deliverables for products and for services in support of Union legislation and policies; (iii) the recognition of technical specifications in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT) and; (iv) financing of European standardisation. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Enhanced cooperation : the cooperation between national standardisation bodies will become more transparent. International standards : the use of standards developed by other organisations in the field of information and communication technologies will be possible in public procurement, provided that these standards comply with a set of criteria based on the WTO principles for international standardisation processes, in domains where there are no European standards, where European standards have not gained market uptake or where these standards have become obsolete. Planning : the planning will be improved: the Commission will establish an annual Work Programme, which will identify priorities for European standardisation and the mandates required. Representation of SMEs : SMEs and societal stakeholders should be better represented in European standardisation, and the financial support to organisations representing SMEs and societal stakeholders will be ensured. Simplification : a reduction of the administrative burden imposed on the Commission and the ESOs, for example by the possibility of a robust simplification of lump sums, clearly disconnected from any verification of actual costs of implementation. This proposal constitutes a further shift towards a performance-based system, based on the definition of agreed indicators and objectives (outputs and outcomes). Service standards : although European standards are already widely used for transport and logistics, postal services and electronic communications networks and services, the voluntary European standards have played a less prominent role in supporting the completion of the single market for services. This proposal therefore includes service standards within its scope in order to enable the Commission to issue mandates requesting the development of European service standards and to finance a part of the cost of this development. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal relates to the extension of an existing action. It should be noted that the amounts set out in this legislative financial statement do not prejudice the forthcoming Commission proposal for the post-2013 multi-annual financial framework. Budgetary appropriations allocated to this action will be proposed by the Commission in the annual budgetary procedure. Consequently, this financial statement is limited to one year (2013). The implication on operational appropriations is estimated at EUR 27 million in commitment appropriations. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1506/98 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1506/98 of 13 July 1998 establishing a concession in the form of a Community tariff quota for Turkey in 1998 in respect of hazelnuts and suspending certain concessions. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main provisions codified : under the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey, concessions were granted to that country in respect of certain agricultural products. 1996 been applying a ban on the import of live animals of the bovine species and restrictions on the import of beef. Those measures, being quantitative restrictions, are incompatible with the Agreement and prevent the Union from benefiting from the concessions granted to it under Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council. As a result of those measures, exports to Turkey of the products in question originating in the Union are blocked. Suspension of concessions : in order to protect the Union's commercial interests, the situation should be counterbalanced by means of equivalent measures. The concessions set out in the Annex to this Regulation should therefore be suspended. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (examination procedure). It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 1506/98."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to making available on the market of non-automatic weighing instruments is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2009/23/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The proposal does not change the scope of Directive 2009/23/EC and the essential requirements. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the instruments are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the article bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently, the provisions of Directive 2009/23/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2009/23/EC on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their pyrotechnic articles comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant instrument is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite navigation systems and related applications between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United States of America, of the other part, was signed in 2004. It entered into force on 12 December 2011 for an initial period of ten years and expires on 12 December 2021. Both Parties have confirmed their intention to renew the agreement for a further period of five years, without any amendment to the Agreement. The Galileo and GPS systems are under further development and evolving. Continued cooperation between the two systems is necessary for a number of reasons, including to ensure compatibility and interoperability. Moreover, the United States is a privileged satellite navigation partner of the Union. It is in the interest of the EU to renew this Agreement in order to continue to further engage in satellite navigation cooperation with the U.S. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the renewal for a further period of five years of the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS satellite navigation systems and related applications between the United States of America, on the one hand, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other. The Agreement’s objective is to provide a framework for cooperation between the Parties in the promotion, provision and use of civil GPS and Galileo navigation and timing signals and services, value-added services, augmentations, and global navigation and timing goods. Moreover, the Parties intend to work together, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora, as provided herein, to promote and facilitate the use of these signals, services, and equipment for peaceful civil, commercial, and scientific uses, consistent with and in furtherance of mutual security interests. It should be noted that this proposed renewal of the Agreement (i) does not foresee conferring Galileo ownership or decision-making rights to the U.S; (ii) does not give the U.S. the right to participate in the EU GNSS-related Programme Committees or Working Groups; (iii) does not allow the U.S. to participate in Galileo PRS (Public Regulated Service) relevant fora, working groups or discussions."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities presupposes the existence of an international fisheries agreement when granting fishing authorisations to third-country vessels within EU waters. The EU has not concluded such an international fisheries agreement with Venezuela. However, access for Venezuelan fishing vessels operating in EU waters off the coast of the French department of Guiana has been provided in the form of a Council Declaration (Decision 2012/19/EU) which, in accordance with the case-law of the International Court of Justice, has legal effects under international law. By its judgement of 26 November 2014 on the joined cases C-103/12 and C-165/12 (European Parliament and the Commission v. Council), the Court of Justice annulled Council Decision 2012/19/EU. It also confirmed that decisions relating to the conclusion of external fisheries agreements fall fully within the scope of Article 43(2) TFEU (in conjunction with the applicable procedure of Article 218 TFEU, i.e. Article 218(6)a(v) for the decisions on the conclusion) and rejected the position that such decisions could fall within the scope of Article 43(3) TFEU. The Court of Justice maintained the effects of the Council Decision until the entry into force, within a reasonable period of time after the date of the judgement, of a new decision to be adopted on an appropriate legal basis. Hence, the present proposal. CONTENT: in order to ensure the continuity of the access following the judgement of the Court, the Commission considers it necessary that the Council re-adopts a Decision on the declaration addressed to Venezuela confirming its readiness to issue fishing authorisations to a limited number of fishing vessels flying the flag of Venezuela on the condition that they comply with the applicable legally binding Union acts. The Declaration provides that in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters, the authorised fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall comply with the provisions of the European Union common fisheries policy concerning the conservation and control measures and other European Union provisions governing fishing activities in that zone.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: among the main social rules applying to the transport sector are the following: provisions on the organisation of drivers' working time set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; minimum requirements for enforcement set out in Directive 2006/22/EC; rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods under Regulation (EC) No 561/2006; provisions on posting of workers established in Directive 96/71/EC and the enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU. The current evaluation of the social legislation in road transport in the EU has shown shortcomings in the current legal framework and problems regarding enforcement. Furthermore, a number of discrepancies exist between Member States in interpretation, application and implementation of the rules. This creates legal uncertainty and unequal treatment of drivers and operators, which is detrimental to the working, social and competition conditions in the sector. The Commission aims to amend the existing rules in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable, whilst at the same time mitigating the excessive regulatory burdens on operators and preventing distortions of competition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four options were considered. The first policy option focused on clarifying the legal framework and increasing cooperation between enforcement authorities. The second focused on strengthening enforcement and improving working patterns for workers. The third proposed substantive changes in the rules, in particular banning performance based pay. The fourth option comprised sector specific criteria and specific enforcement measures for the posting of workers in the road transport sector. Significant savings for operators result mainly from the latter option, and in particular the measures on administrative and control requirements. These savings are in the range of EUR 785 million per year in administrative costs. CONTENT: the proposal makes a limited number of amendments to Directive 2006/22/EC and lays down sector-specific rules on posting of workers in the road transport sector in relation to Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU. Requirements on enforcement : the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2006/22/EC in order to: require that checks carried out by Member States include checking compliance with the working time provisions set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; require that the information submitted by Member States to the Commission on the results of checks at the roadside and at premises to include checks on compliance with Directive 2002/15/EC; specify that serious infringements giving rise to checks at premises of road transport undertakings shall also include infringements of Directive 2002/15/EC; improve administrative cooperation between Member States with regard to the implementation of the social rules in road transport has proven insufficient, making cross-border enforcement more difficult, inefficient and inconsistent. It is therefore necessary to establish a framework for effective communication and mutual assistance, including exchange of data on infringements and information on good practices in enforcement; further improve the effectiveness, and consistency of the existing national risk rating systems : the Commission will establish a uniform formula for calculating the risk rating of transport undertakings, and take into account certain criteria, such as the use of the 'smart' tachygraph. Data in the risk rating system must be made available to control authorities. Posting of workers : the Commission proposes that drivers are considered as posted workers if they spend at least 3 days in a given calendar month on the territory of a Member State. All cabotage operations will be considered as posting of workers from day 1 – regardless of their duration. The minimum rate of pay and the minimum annual paid holidays of the host Member State should apply to cabotage irrespective of the frequency and duration of the operations carried out by a driver. For the purposes of the calculation of the periods of posting: a daily working period shorter than six hours spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as half a day; a daily working period of six hours or more spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as a full day; breaks and rest periods as well as periods of availability spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as working period. The proposal lays down the specific administrative requirements and control measures for checking compliance with the provisions on posting of workers in road transport."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the preparation of financial statements has been identified as one of the most burdensome regulatory obligations for companies. Small companies face proportionally higher administrative burdens in comparison to medium-sized/large companies. On 18 December 2008, the European Parliament adopted a non-legislative Resolution on accounting requirements as regards small and medium-sized companies, particularly micro-entities, stating that Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (‘the Accounting Directives’) are often very burdensome for small and medium-sized companies, and in particular for micro-entities, and asking the Commission to continue its efforts to review those Directives. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish at a Union level minimum equivalent legal requirements as regards the extent of the financial information that should be made available to the public by undertakings that are in competition with one another. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : broadly, the Impact Assessment looked at two issues: Financial Statements : five broad policy options were examined, starting from the baseline scenario. The broad option of revising and modernising selected requirements currently in the Accounting Directives was finally retained as the preferred option. After examining more detailed options, it appeared that a ""mini-regime"" specific to small companies would be the best policy choice. The potential for administrative burden reduction of this policy amounts to EUR 1.5 bn which arises from reduced reporting requirements in the notes, further relaxation of statutory audit and the exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements for small groups. A second detailed option concerned the increase of the thresholds for small and medium-sized companies. The burden reduction potential of this proposal amounts to around EUR 0.2 billion. The estimated potential for savings is therefore estimated at EUR 1.7 bn overall. Micro-companies will in any event benefit from the simplified regime offered to small companies. However, the impact on micro-entities of the above policy choices has been disregarded as the proposal for a Directive on micro-entities that is pending before the European Parliament and the Council specifically addresses these. Reporting of payments to governments : the Impact Assessment analysed five broad policy options starting from the baseline scenario (policy option 0), next examining possible schemes that would result in a global agreement for country-by-country reporting for EU and non-EU MNCs (policy option 1), and lastly assessing several policy options that would oblige only EU companies to disclose country by country information (policy options 2 to 4). Whilst policy option 2 requires the disclosure of payments to governments on a country basis from the extractive industry and the loggers of primary forests, policy option 3 requires the disclosure of such information on a country- and project- basis. In addition to a report on payments to government, policy option 4 would require a complete set of country-by-country accounts to be prepared by companies active in the extractive industry and loggers of primary forests. The option of requiring country-by-country reporting (CBCR) of payments to government on a country-and-project basis by EU Multinational Companies (MNCs) in the extractive industry and logging of primary forests (policy option 3) was retained. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50(1) TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal introduces certain key provisions. A specific regime for small companies : this will considerably reduce the administrative burden currently borne by small companies when they prepare their financial statements. It will limit disclosures by way of notes to the accounts to (i) accounting policies; (ii) guarantees, commitments, contingencies and arrangements that are not recognised in the balance sheet; (iii) post-balance sheet events not recognised in the balance sheet; (iv) long-term and secured debts; and (v) related party transactions. It should be noted that mandating the disclosure of items (iii) and (v) will result in new obligations imposed for small companies, as a majority of Member States have provided for exemptions from these disclosures for such companies. Harmonise thresholds : the proposal also seeks to harmonise thresholds to ensure that the administrative burden reduction actually reaches all small companies in the EU. Currently many companies that are small under EU definitions enter the medium-sized or large company category because the definitions in the Directives are lower when transposed at Member State level. Small companies : the main measures are as follows: ·  maximum harmonisation will ensure that companies of the same size benefit from a level playing field across the EU; ·  notes to the accounts will be limited to only five key areas; ·  no requirement for a statutory audit; ·  small groups will be exempt from preparing consolidated financial statements Medium and large companies : the proposal seeks to improve the comparability and clarity of financial statements prepared by medium-sized and large companies, and by small companies to a limited extent. To this end, it seeks to reduce the number of options currently available to Member States, insofar as these options are detrimental to the comparability of the financial statements. General principles such as ""substance over form"" will become mandatory so as to increase the clarity of financial statements. Reporting of payments to governments : in order to promote governments' accountability and good governance, the proposal introduces new reporting requirements for companies active in the extractive industry or in the logging of primary forests. It is proposed that companies shall disclose the payments they make to governments in each country where they operate and for each project, where the payment has been attributed to a certain project and when material to the recipient government. In line with the overall objective and in order to limit the additional administrative burden, the new requirement is limited to large companies and public interest entities. Proposed Directive and repeal of existing legislation : the proposal will repeal the Accounting Directives. Micro-entities : it should be noted that the proposal complements the proposal for a Directive on the financial statements of micro-entities which is currently still being negotiated by the EU co-legislators. Given that the Council and the Parliament have now both agreed to the principle of a micro entity regime, the current proposal does not contain any new policy proposal regarding micro companies as assessed in the Impact Assessment. The Commission is willing to consider, together with the EU co-legislators, how best to integrate into the current proposal the final inter-institutional agreement on the Directive of 2009. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."
