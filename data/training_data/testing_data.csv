PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America was signed in Washington, DC, on 5 December 1997 and entered into force on 14 October 1998. The Agreement provides that the Agreement is concluded for an initial period of five years and may be extended thereafter, with possible amendments, for additional periods of five years, by mutual written agreement between the Parties. The Council successively approved, on three occasions, in 2003, 2008 and 2013, the extension of the Agreement for additional periods of five years. The Agreement is due to expire on 14 October 2018. The assessment carried out by the Commission services demonstrates that the Agreement provides an important framework for facilitating cooperation between the Union and the United States of America in common priority areas for science and technology, leading to mutual benefits. It is therefore in the Union’s interest to extend the Agreement for a new period of five years. Both Parties have confirmed their intention to extend the Agreement for an additional period of five years without any amendments to the Agreement. CONTENT: the Council draft seeks to approve, on behalf of the Union, the extension of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America for an additional period of five years."
6158EP7,"""""Processing of personal data for the purposes of crime prevention""""",0.018,0.077,0.93,0.29,0.333,0.892,0.872,0.914,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of public safety, and to ensure the exchange of personal data between competent authorities within the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member States. It was complemented by several instruments providing specific data protection rules in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (ex-third pillar), including Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA has a limited scope of application , since it only applies to cross-border data processing and not to processing activities by the police and judiciary authorities at purely national level. The Framework Decision leaves a large room for manoeuvre to Member States' national laws in implementing its provisions. Additionally, it does not contain any mechanism or advisory group similar to the Article 29 Working Party supporting common interpretation of its provisions, nor foresees any implementing powers for the Commission to ensure a common approach in its implementation. Due to the specific nature of the field of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, it was acknowledged in Declaration 21 (annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon) that specific rules on the protection of personal data and the free movement of such data in the fields of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation based on Article 16 TFEU may prove necessary. In 2010, the European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative initiatives. In its resolution on the Stockholm Programme , the European Parliament welcomed a comprehensive data protection scheme in the EU and among others called for the revision of the Framework Decision. The Commission stressed in its Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme the need to ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is consistently applied in the context of all EU policies. In its Communication on “ A comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union ”, the Commission concluded that the EU needs a more comprehensive and coherent policy on the fundamental right to personal data protection. This proposal further details the approach for the new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the EU as presented in its Communication on this issue. The legal framework consists of two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and this proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of: (i) improving the internal market dimension of data protection, (ii) making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and, (iii) creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence, including police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. As regards this latter objective in particular, two policy options were assessed: a first one basically extending the scope of data protection rules in this area and addressing the gaps and other issues raised by the Framework Decision, and a second more far-reaching one with very prescriptive and stringent rules, which would also entail the immediate amendment of all other ""former third pillar"" instruments. A third ""minimalistic"" option based largely on interpretative Communications and policy support measures, such as funding programmes and technical tools, with minimum legislative intervention, was not considered appropriate to address the issues identified in this area in relation to data protection. The analysis of the overall impact led to the development of the preferred policy option which is incorporated in the present proposal. According to the assessment, its implementation will lead to further strengthening data protection in this policy area in particular by including domestic data processing, thereby also enhancing legal certainty for competent authorities in the areas of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 16(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive repeals Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. It defines the rules relating to processing of personal data for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal offences, and sets out the Directive's two-fold objective, i.e. to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of public safety, and to ensure the exchange of personal data between competent authorities within the Union. It defines the scope of application of the Directive. The scope of the Directive is not limited to cross-border data processing but applies to all processing activities carried out by 'competent authorities' as defined in the Directive. Principles : the proposal sets out the principles relating to processing of personal data and requires the distinction, as far as possible; between personal data of different categories of data subjects. It sets out the grounds for lawful processing, when necessary for the performance of a task carried out by a competent authority based on national law, to comply with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person or to prevent an immediate and serious threat to public security. The proposed Directive sets out a general prohibition of processing special categories of personal data and the exceptions from this general rule. It establishes a prohibition of measures based solely on automated processing of personal data if not authorised by law providing appropriate safeguards. Rights of the data subject : the proposal introduces the obligation for Member States to ensure easily accessible and understandable information, and to oblige controllers to provide procedures and mechanisms for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights. This includes the requirement that the exercise of the rights shall be in principle free of charge. It specifies the obligation for Member States to ensure the information towards the data subject. It also provides the obligation for Member States to ensure the data subject's right of access to their personal data. The proposal provides that Member States may adopt legislative measures restricting the right of access if required by the specific nature of data processing in the areas of police and criminal justice, and on the information of the data subject on a restriction of access. Provisions on the rectification, erasure and restriction of processing in judicial proceedings provide clarification based on Article 4(4) of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Controller and processor : the proposal sets out that the Member States must ensure the compliance of the controller with the obligations arising from the principles of data protection by design and by default. It clarifies the position and obligation of processors, and adds new elements, including that a processor that processes data beyond the controller's instructions is to be considered a co-controller. It introduces the obligation for controllers and processors to maintain documentation of all processing systems and procedures under their responsibility. Data security : the Article on the security of processing is based on the current Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46 on the security of processing, and Article 22 of Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, extending the related obligations to processors, irrespective of their contract with the controller. The proposal introduces an obligation to notify personal data breaches, inspired by the personal data breach notification, clarifying and separating the obligations to notify the supervisory authority and to communicate, in qualified circumstances, to the data subject. It also provides for exemptions on reasons set out in the Directive. Data Protection Officer : the proposal introduces an obligation for the controller to appoint a mandatory data protection officer who should fulfil the tasks listed in the Directive. Where several competent authorities are acting under the supervision of a central authority, functioning as controller, at least this central authority should designate such a data protection officer. Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations : transfers to third countries may take place only if the transfer is necessary for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. The proposal lays down that transfers to a third country may take place in relation to which the Commission has adopted an adequacy decision of the level of protection or, in the absence of such decisions, where appropriate safeguards are in place. It furthermore sets out the criteria for the Commission’s assessment of an adequate or not adequate level of protection, and expressly includes the rule of law, judicial redress and independent supervision. It also provides for the possibility for the Commission to assess the level of protection afforded by a territory or a processing sector within a third country. In addition, the proposed Directive: defines the appropriate safeguards needed prior to international transfers, in the absence of a Commission adequacy decision. These safeguards may be adduced by a legally binding instrument such as an international agreement. Alternatively, the data controller may on the basis of an assessment of the circumstances surrounding the transfer conclude that they exist; spells out the derogations for data transfer; obliges Member States to provide that the controller informs the recipient of any processing restrictions and takes all reasonable steps to ensure that these restrictions are met by recipients of the personal data in the third country or international organisation; explicitly provides for international co-operation mechanisms for the protection of personal data between the Commission and the supervisory authorities of third countries. Independent national supervisory authorities : the proposal obliges Member States to establish supervisory authorities and to enlarge the mission of these authorities to contribute to the consistent application of the Directive throughout the Union, which may be the supervisory authority established under the General Data Protection Regulation. It clarifies the conditions for the independence of supervisory authorities, implementing case law of the Court of Justice. It sets out the competence of the supervisory authorities. It obliges Member States to provide for the duties of the supervisory authority, including hearing and investigating complaints and promoting the awareness of the public on risk, rules, safeguards and rights. A particular duty of the supervisory authorities in the context of this Directive is, where direct access is refused or restricted, to exercise the right of access on behalf of data subjects and to check the lawfulness of the data processing. Co-operation : the proposal introduces rules on mandatory mutual assistance. It provides that the European Data Protection Advisory Board, established by the General Data Protection Regulation, exercises its tasks also in relation to processing activities within the scope of this Directive. Remedies, liability and sanctions : the proposal provides: (i) for the right of any data subject to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (ii) that the bodies, organisations or associations which may lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject and also in case of a personal data breach independently of a data subject's complaint; (iii) for the right to a judicial remedy against a supervisory authority; (iv) the data subject may launch a court action for obliging the supervisory authority to act on a complaint; (v) the right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor; (vi) for the introduction of common rules for court proceedings, including the rights of bodies, organisations or associations to represent data subjects before the courts, and the right of supervisory authorities to engage in legal proceedings; (vii) for the Member States to provide for the right to compensation and lay down rules on penalties, to sanction infringements of the Directive, and to ensure their implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Data Protection Supervisor as specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. These implications require reprogramming of Heading 5 of the Financial Perspective. The total appropriations are estimated at EUR 24.339 million for 2014-2020. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cybersecurity is an issue of common interest of the Union. Future security depends, among others, on enhancing technological and industrial ability to protect the Union against cyber threats, as both civilian infrastructure and military capacities rely on secure digital systems. Following the 2013 cybersecurity strategy, the Union has continued to increase its activities to meet the growing challenges of cybersecurity: in 2016, the Union adopted its first measures in the area of cybersecurity through Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council on security of network and information systems; the creation in 2016 of the Public-Private Partnership (‘cPPP’) on cybersecurity in the Union was a solid first step bringing together the research, industry and public sector communities to facilitate research and innovation in cybersecurity and within the limits of the 2014-2020 financial framework should result in good, more focused outcomes in research and innovation. It will have triggered up to EUR 1.8 billion of investment by 2020; in September 2017, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy presented a joint Communication on ‘Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU’ to further reinforce the Union’s resilience, deterrence and response to cyber-attacks; at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017, Heads of State and Government called on the Union to become a global leader in the field of cybersecurity by 2025. With more than 660 cyber security competence centres throughout the EU, the EU already has considerable expertise in this area. However, the efforts of the research and industry communities are fragmented, lacking alignment and a common mission, which hinders the EU's competitiveness in this field. The Commission considers that these efforts and expertise need to be pooled, networked and used in an efficient manner to reinforce and complement existing research, technology and industrial capacities at Union and national levels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: among the main arguments in favour of the selected option were: the ability to create a real cybersecurity industrial policy by supporting activities related not only to research and development but also to market deployment; the flexibility to allow different cooperation models with the community and the network of competence centres to optimise the use of existing knowledge and resources; the ability to structure cooperation of the public and private stakeholders coming from all relevant sectors, including defence. CONTENT: this Regulation proposes to establish the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, as well as the Network of National Coordination Centres, and lays down rules for the nomination of National Coordination Centres as well as for the establishment of the Cybersecurity Competence Community. The Competence Centre : its role would be to facilitate the work of the Network of National Coordination Centres and to enhance the cybersecurity competences, by driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating access to the expertise so gathered. To this end, it would coordinate the use of cybersecurity funds under the EU's next long-term budget for the period 2021-2027 under the Digital Europe Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme. Its objectives would be: · to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, knowledge and infrastructures at the service of industries, the public sector and research communities; · to contribute to the wide deployment of the latest cyber security products and solutions across the economy; · to improve the understanding of cybersecurity and contribute to reducing skills gaps in the Union related to cybersecurity; · to contribute to the reinforcement of cybersecurity research and development in the Union; · to enhance synergies between the civilian and defence dimensions of cybersecurity. The Competence Centre would be set up as a European partnership to facilitate joint investment by the Union, Member States and/or industry. Therefore, the proposal requires Member States to contribute a commensurate amount to the actions of the Competence Centre and Network. The principal decision-making body is the Governing Board, in which all Member States take part but only those Member States which participate financially have voting rights. The Network of National Coordination Centres : each Member State would nominate a national coordination centre to lead the Network, which would focus on developing new and expanded cybersecurity capabilities and expertise. The Network would identify and support the most relevant cybersecurity projects in Member States. The Cybersecurity Competences Community : this would contribute to the mission of the Competence Centre by enhancing and disseminating cybersecurity expertise throughout the Union. It would involve a large and diverse group of actors involved in the development of cybersecurity technologies, such as research organisations, supply and demand side industries and the public sector. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union's contribution to the Competence Centre to cover administrative and operating costs includes the following elements: EUR 1 981 668 000 from the Digital Europe Programme, of which up to EUR 23 746 000 for administrative costs; EUR 2.8 billion from the Horizon Europe programme, including for administrative costs; this contribution will be proposed by the Commission during the legislative process and, in any case, before a political agreement is reached."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Regulation (EU) No 691/2011). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: sound information on the key trends, pressures and drivers for environmental change is essential for the development of effective policy, its implementation, and the empowerment of citizens more generally. Users put much emphasis on analysis and applications of environmental accounts in modelling and outlooks, both for preparing policy proposals and reporting on policy implementation and impacts. Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts covers three modules: (i) air emissions accounts ; (ii) environmental taxes ; (iii) material flow accounts. It contains a list of possible new modules to be introduced later based on Commission proposals. In accordance with the Regulation, several such pilot studies have been completed which clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the three new modules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The proposal has been discussed, in the framework of the European Statistical System, with data producers and users. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal of the amending act seeks to extend the coverage of Regulation 691/2011 to include the following additional modules: a module for environmental protection expenditure accounts; a module for environmental goods and services sector accounts; a module for physical energy flow accounts. These three new modules contribute directly to the Union's policy priorities of green growth and resource efficiency by providing important information on indicators such as market output and employment in the EGSS, national environmental protection expenditure and the use of energy in a detailed NACE breakdown. No new data collection is necessary for implementing the new modules. The United Nations Statistical Commission has adopted the System of Environmental- Economic Accounting (SEEA) as an international statistical standard at its 43rd session in February 2012. The new modules proposed are fully in line with the revised European Strategy for Environmental Accounting (ESEA 2008).

7547EP8,"""""Adapting to development in the road transport sector""""",0.029,0.136,0.04,0.021,0.077,0.687,0.068,0.096,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve the single market in road transport through amendments intended to eliminate causes for disparities and to ensure better enforcement of the rules. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (‘light commercial vehicles’): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
6411EP8,"""""Conservation of fishery resources and protection of marine ecosystems through technical measures""""",0.657,0.769,0.1,0.292,0.231,0.269,0.691,0.038,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to change the governance structure of technical measures on the conservation of fishery resources in order to optimise the contribution of technical measures to achieving the key objectives of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: technical measures are rules governing how and where fishermen may fish. They aim to control the catch that can be taken with a given amount of fishing effort and also to minimise the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem. They concern: (i) measures that regulate the operation of the gear; (ii) minimum sizes below which fish must be returned to the sea; (iii) measures that set spatial and temporal controls to protect aggregations of juvenile or spawning fish; (iv) measures that mitigate the impacts of fishing gears on sensitive species or closed areas to protect sensitive habitats. The history of technical measures applying in European fisheries legislation within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is one of numerous regulations, amendments, implementing rules and temporary technical measures introduced as stop-gaps to resolve emerging problems. Across all Union sea basins and non-Union waters in which Union vessels operate there are more than 30 regulations which contain technical measures. With the new challenges of the new CFP, which came into force on 1 January 2014, the retrospective evaluation concluded that the current regulatory structure for technical measures will continue to be sub-optimal. This is because of five identifiable problems: sub-optimal performance : technical measures provide little incentive to fish selectively where there is no cost to discarding, or of catching sensitive species or impacting adversely on the seabed; difficult to measure effectiveness : the current regulations do not contain any defined metrics on which to measure success; prescriptive and complex rules : some measures are difficult for control authorities to enforce, and for fishermen to comply with; lack of flexibility : technical measures are mostly decided following a complex, inflexible and lengthy politically-driven process which is not well suited to defining detailed technical rules that need frequent updating and periodic review; insufficient involvement of key stakeholders in the decision-making process. These repeated failures to reach agreement on a new technical measures regulation clearly highlight the need for a new approach which aims to change the governance structure of technical measures rather than making wholesale changes to the measures themselves, the improved flexibility and incentives for fishing selectivity it introduces will deliver improvements in the effectiveness of technical measures. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred approach is that of a new framework Regulation containing a) general provisions (scope, objectives, guiding principles) and definition of the expected results and corresponding standards; b) common rules and technical provisions; and c) baseline standards (by region) corresponding to identified results which would function as default measures in the context of regionalisation. The preferred option largely presents changes to the regulatory structure and governance of technical measures. Few new measures are introduced and any changes to the substance are very much about deletion of rules in order to simplify and lessen administrative burden, improve controllability or consolidate nature conservation measures. CONTENT: the proposal has the following structure: Subject matter : the proposed Regulation lays down technical measures concerning: (a) the taking and landing of fisheries resources; and (b) the operation of fishing gears and the interaction of fishing activities with marine ecosystems. The proposal contains general provisions, overarching and specific objectives, targets linked to the general and specific objectives expressed in terms of levels of unwanted catches; thresholds for bycatches of sensitive species; and reduction in the extent of the seabed significantly affected by fishing; principles of good governance and definitions. The definitions relate primarily to the definition of fishing gears and fishing operations and are common to all regions. They consolidate and update the existing definitions contained in the existing Regulations. Common technical measures : the proposal contains common rules currently contained in all of the primary technical measures regulations but applicable to all sea basins and considered as de facto permanent as there is no need or justification for changing them. The provisions included under this part are: prohibited gears and practices including prohibition on the sale of marine species caught using certain gear types, measures to protect sensitive species (e.g. marine mammals, reptiles and seabirds) and habitats (e.g. coldwater corals) including those listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives; general restrictions on the use of towed gears and conditions for their use (covers basic codend construction and permissible attachments to fishing gears); restrictions on the use of static nets. This includes the consolidation of the existing restrictions on the use of driftnets (i.e. prohibition to use drift nets above 2.5km, prohibition on using such gears to target highly migratory species and the total prohibition on the use of driftnets in the Baltic). Under regionalisation Member States should strengthen these provisions up to and including the introduction of a total prohibition on the use of such gears where there is scientific evidence that shows the continued use of driftnets constitutes a threat to the conservation status of sensitive species in that region; minimum conservation reference sizes; common measures to reduce discarding. Regionalisation : regionalisation sets the general principles for regionalisation with reference to baseline measures which will apply where no regional measures are in places and establishes the empowerments needed for regionalisation of technical measures through multiannual plans, temporary discard plans and conservation measures necessary for compliance with obligations under environmental legislation. The regional measures that can be taken under temporary discard plans are also defined, as well as safeguards that will be taken if scientific evidence shows that the conservation objectives are not being met by the regional measures. To this effect, a safeguard clause is included that allows the Commission to act where available scientific advice indicates that immediate action is required to protect marine species. Such measures could include restrictions on the use fishing gears or on fishing activities in certain areas or during certain periods. Technical Measures in non-Union waters : the Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of existing detailed rules concerning lists of vulnerable marine ecosystems and also specific technical measures related to defined fisheries for blue ling and redfish agreed by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Annexes : the Annexes contain baseline measures by sea basin (i.e. North Sea, Baltic, Northwestern waters, Southwestern waters, Mediterranean, Black Sea and the outermost regions). These baseline measures will apply in the absence of measures being put in place regionally. There are also annexes containing a list of prohibited species that if caught as bycatches must be returned immediately to the sea; closed areas established for the protection of sensitive habitats and a list of species that are prohibited for capture with driftnets. Reporting : by the end of 2020 and every third year thereafter, the Commission will report on the implementation of this Regulation including an assessment of the impact of technical measures on the conservation of fisheries resources and on the environmental impacts of fisheries on marine ecosystems. On the basis of that report, the Commission will propose any necessary amendments.

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of Title V acquis and therefore does not participate in the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013, which allows law enforcement authorities to consult Eurodac for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. On 8 March 2006, the Agreement between the European Community and Denmark concerning the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged by a third-country national in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and the 'Eurodac' system for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention was concluded. However, access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes does not fall within the scope of that agreement. At a meeting on 14 May 2014 with representatives of the Commission, Denmark and the associated countries confirmed their interest in entering into negotiations with the European Union to extend the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to them via an international agreement. The negotiations have been finalised and an Agreement in the form of a Protocol to the Agreement of 8 March 2006, extending the application of the Agreement of 8 March 2006 to law enforcement was initialled. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision aims to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention, extending that agreement to law enforcement. The Protocol establishes the application of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 to Denmark regarding access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes. The Protocol: - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of the other participating States and Europol to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by Denmark when trying to establish the identity of, or obtain more information on, a terrorist or serious crime suspect;; - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of Denmark to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by the other participating States; - guarantees that the current EU level of protection of personal data is applicable to the processing of personal data pursuant to the Protocol by the authorities of Denmark and of the Member States; - conditions the access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes by Denmark by prior legal and technical implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA with regard to dactyloscopic data. The Protocol provides that the mechanisms regarding amendments provided for in the Agreement of 8 March 2006 should apply to all amendments regarding the access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: due to fiscal austerity in the Member States, there is a danger that infrastructure projects of EU interest are not carried out at the pace required to achieve Europe 2020 objectives thereby compromising the EU's economic recovery and growth. Innovative solutions are urgently required to mobilise a greater share of private savings and to improve the range of financial instruments available for infrastructure projects, especially in the energy, transport and ICT sectors. The norm for infrastructure projects with commercial potential should be to combine EU funds in partnerships with the capital market and banking sectors, particularly via the European Investment Bank (EIB). In its resolution of 8 June 2011, the European Parliament underlined that the Union should take action notably to enhance the use of the Union funds as a catalyst for attracting additional financing from the European Investment Bank (EIB), European Bank for Reconstruction and development (EBRD), other international financial institutions and the private sector. On 29 June 2011, the European Commission adopted its proposal for the multi-annual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020. One of the key decisions was to bring the granting of financial aid for transport, energy and ICT infrastructure into a common legislative framework, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The mechanism will provide a longer term framework enabling the creation and implementation, in a timely and efficient manner, of projects in the fields of energy, transport and telecommunications. The Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative will become an integral part of the risk-sharing instruments of the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2014-2020. The main objective of the pilot phase in 2012-2013 is to prepare the operational phase of the initiative under the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2014-2020 and to provide immediate support for infrastructure projects. In order to allow a more efficient implementation of the financial instruments under the Connecting Europe Facility, the launch of a pilot phase is required, both to allow the optimisation of the design and stimulate investor appetite for the post-2013 period. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment reviews the current market situation with a link to the impact assessment accompanying the proposal for the CEF which includes more background on the potential CEF instruments, financing gaps and market imperfections affecting current levels of investment in infrastructure. Three options were analysed: i) the status quo, i.e. continuing with current grant programmes for energy and transport and the current grant programmes and financial instruments for transport; ii) regulatory incentives and iii) the proposal to implement the Project Bond Initiative. In this context, the potential risks hindering the implementation of the Initiative have been reviewed and a quantifiable expected impact revealed in terms of a multiplier effect. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 172 and 173 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is proposing To launch a pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative in the area of transport, energy and ICT. This initiative seeks to mobilise investment in areas that will stimulate growth and create jobs. The Initiative aims to provide the credit enhancement required to attract capital market investors and would facilitate the creation of a new asset class in terms of infrastructure project bonds. The initiative will complement, rather than replace bank lending and thus provide an alternative and competitive source of long-term debt finance to infrastructure projects. To have the maximum impact, the initiative could also be applied to projects at an advanced stage of the bidding process for the purposes of refinancing during or shortly after the end of the construction period. In the pilot phase, the Commission would work in particular with the EIB to optimise the design of the initiative for optimal implementation from 2014 onwards. Budgetary funds should be requested by the EIB on the basis of a range of projects, which the EIB would deem suitable and likely to be realised. Any such requests should be made prior to 31 December 2013. Due to the complexity of large infrastructure projects, the actual approval might take place at a later date, but no later than 31 December 2014. In order to implement the pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, Decision No 1639/2006/EC establishing the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP)and Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 laying down the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks should be amended. Given the short time available, the Commission invites the Parliament and the Council to adopt the proposal for a pilot phase as speedily as possible. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the total budget available from the EU for the pilot phase of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative is EUR 230 million. The initiative will be entirely financed by redeployment within the envelopes of existing programmes in 2012 and 2013. The following redeployments could be made in favour of the initiative: up to EUR 200 million from the TEN-T (transport) budget, up to EUR 20 million from the budget of the framework programme for innovation and competitiveness in order to allow the financing of projects in the field of ICT and in particular broadband, and an amount of up to EUR 10 million from the TEN-E (energy) budget."
1009EP9,"""""Temporary measures concerning the operation of air services""""",0.968,0.967,0.932,0.849,0.596,0.944,0.844,0.195,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to temporarily amend several provisions of existing aviation legislation in order to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the EU aviation sector. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp fall in air traffic due to a significant drop in demand and the adoption by Member States and third countries of direct measures, such as border closures and flight bans, to curb its spread. Figures published by the EU Network Manager at the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (‘Eurocontrol’), indicate a fall in air traffic of around 90% for the European region at the end of March 2020 as compared to March 2019. The aviation sector is of strategic importance to the European Union and makes a vital contribution to the EU’s overall economy and employment. In 2016, for example, the aviation sector supported 9.4 million jobs in the EU and contributed more than EUR 624 billion to the EU's GDP. It also contributes to the success of SMEs and tourism. The liquidity crisis in the aviation sector may lead to insolvencies within a few months if left unaddressed. Given the contribution of aviation to the overall performance of the EU economy and the importance of its overall weight, the Commission considers it essential that the EU takes action to support the EU aviation sector. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to temporarily amend several provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to allow the Commission and national authorities to more easily address a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate of the impacts on the aviation sector for the duration of the crisis. These temporary measures include the following: Modification to air carrier licencing rules in case of financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, Member States must suspend or revoke the operating licence of any air carrier, which may not to be able to fulfil its actual or potential financial obligations for the next twelve months. Alternatively, the authorities may grant a temporary licence to such airlines. However, experience has shown that it also sends a very negative signal to the market about the ability of an airline to survive, which in turn aggravates its financial problems, in particular in terms of cash flow. Accordingly, the proposal proposes that based on assessments, carried out from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, the competent licensing authority may decide before the end of that period not to suspend or revoke the operating license of the Union carrier provided that safety is not at risk, and that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction within the following 12 months. Simplification of procedures for the imposition of restrictions on traffic rights The proposal provides for a temporary derogation to procedural requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. The derogation clarifies that a Member State may temporarily keep a justified and proportionate emergency measure in place for a period beyond 14 days – but limited to the duration of public health risks clearly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should be able to refuse, limit or impose conditions on the exercise of traffic rights to deal with problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which could be of extended duration. Such emergency measures taken in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic should respect the principles of proportionality and transparency and should be based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. At the request of any of the Member State(s) involved or on its own initiative, the Commission may suspend this action if it does not meet the requirements of the Regulation or is otherwise contrary to Union law. To this effect, Member States are obliged to inform the Commission about changes in duration and scope of their emergency measures. Improving the efficiency of ground handling contracting during the COVID-19 crisis The proposal allows the managing bodies of airport to prolong contracts of suppliers of ground handling service until 31 December 2021, in derogation of Directive 96/67/EC. It also allows the managing body of an airport to directly choose a ground handling service for a maximum period of six months. The amendments also provide for the possibility for the Commission to extend the periods concerned by means of delegated acts."

Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to allocate the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff-rate quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows in the EU-27 and the UK over a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members, including Australia, with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. Australia has negotiating rights for 14 tariff quotas and consultation rights for 6 tariff quotas. Negotiations with Australia resulted in an agreement that was initialled on 18 December 2020 in Geneva."

The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Salmon Action Plan, adopted through the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission in 1997, expired in 2010. Contracting parties to the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) have urged the EU to develop a long term plan for the management of Baltic salmon. Recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries (STECF) state that some Baltic salmon river stocks are outside safe biological limits and that a multiannual plan should be developed at European level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers that the proposed measures will achieve the following objectives: rebuilding all wild Baltic salmon rivers' stocks to safe biological limits and favourable conservation statues by limiting the fishing pressure on weak salmon river stocks; re-establishing self-sustaining salmon populations in rivers with extirpated or very weak populations which would lead to higher overall wild salmon production; safeguarding the genetic diversity of wild salmon as stocking of reared salmon with potential negative genetic effect will be substantially decreased; predictability of fishing opportunities as a result of clear harvest control rules; increased production of wild salmon and recovery of all wild rivers stocks which will in the long term give increased fishing opportunities; benefits for the tourism sector with the potential to grow due to increased fishing opportunities of wild salmon both at sea and in rivers. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he objective of the proposal is to establish a multiannual plan for the management of the fisheries on the salmon stocks in the Baltic Sea to ensure that the conservation status of the entire Baltic stock, i.e. including all salmon rivers' stocks, is favourable and provide for sustainable exploitation. The specific objectives of the initiative shall be to ensure that: (a) the Baltic salmon stock is exploited in a sustainable way according to the principle of maximum sustainable yield; (b) the genetic integrity and diversity of the Baltic salmon stock is safeguarded. The main elements of the plan are: o bjectives, and targets (reach 75% of potential smolt production in each wild salmon river within ten years after the entry into force of this regulation); TAC based on constant fishing mortality rate of 0.1. The TAC will only cover marine fisheries but will include masters of non-fishing vessels offering services for recreational fisheries; obligation for Member States to define and implement technical conservation measures such as closed areas and seasons to protect migrating spawners in their coastal waters not later than 24 months from the entry into force of the plan; a phasing out of release of salmon in rivers with man made obstacles and without potential for re-establishment of self sustaining wild salmon populations in order to protect the genetic diversity of the wild stocks; financial assistance from the EFF for direct restocking of rivers with potential for self-sustaining wild salmon populations as a conservation measure for the wild salmon stock.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force on 16 February 2005 and contains legally binding emission reduction commitments for its first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, for Parties listed in its Annex B. The Union and the Member States ratified the Protocol on 31 May 2002, and agreed to fulfil its commitments under the first commitment period jointly. Iceland ratified the Protocol on 23 May 2002. At the Doha Climate Conference in December 2012, all Parties to the Protocol agreed on the Doha Amendment which establishes a second commitment period of the Protocol (starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020). The Doha Amendment amends Annex B of the Protocol, setting out further legally-binding mitigation commitments for Parties listed in that Annex for the second commitment period, and amending and further elaborates provisions on the implementation of Parties’ commitments during the second commitment period. The Union, the Member States and Iceland also issued a joint declaration upon the adoption of the Doha Amendment, expressing their intention to fulfil their commitments in the second commitment period jointly. The declaration was agreed in December 2012. The agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol should now be formally concluded on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Council is called upon to conclude the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is hereby concluded on behalf of the Union. Purpose of the agreement: the agreement with Iceland sets out the terms governing Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, its Member States and Iceland. It does not establish any obligations for the Union or its Member States. Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment: Iceland's participates in the joint fulfilment on the same basis as that of the Member States. Iceland's emission level, identical to its assigned amount, will relate to Iceland's emissions from gases and sectors covered under the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period but that are not covered under the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system (Directive 2003/87/EC7). Application of relevant EU legislation to Iceland: as Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the Union and the Member States are subject to a number of monitoring, reporting and verification requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. For Parties that have agreed to fulfil their commitments jointly, some of this information needs to be submitted jointly. As a consequence, the Commission will require information from Iceland to enable the Union to fulfil its reporting commitments. Moreover, Iceland will need to participate in the registry system of the Union and its Member States that are relevant for the fulfilment of obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. This requires Iceland to apply Union legislation that is not applicable to third countries (including the Parties to the European Economic Area), especially in relation to the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions as well as with regard to the operation of a registry and the accounting for transactions related to the implementation of commitments of the Union, its Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in line with the terms of joint fulfilment and the internationally agreed rules. The agreement contains a list of Union legislation that shall be binding upon Iceland. It also provides for a procedure to amend this list, to ensure that Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment and follows the same rules and responsibilities as that of Member States, in line with internationally agreed requirements. The agreement also provides for the establishment of a Joint Fulfilment Committee, which ensures the effective implementation and operation of the agreement. Duration and termination of the agreement with Iceland: the draft agreement with Iceland is concluded for a limited time period, until all matters related to the implementation of the second commitment period will have been completed. In case of a breach by Iceland, or objection by Iceland to amend the list of legal acts with application in Iceland according to this agreement, Iceland will be individually responsible to account for all of its greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol, including those under the scope of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system. Ratification: pursuing the rapid entry into force of the Doha Amendment, before the United Nations climate conference in Paris at the end of 2015, which is to adopt a new legally binding instrument for the period after 2020, the Member States and Iceland will seek to ratify both the Doha Amendment and the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol not later than February 2015."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may only adopt the act with Parliament’s approval. BACKGROUND: the EU and Iceland are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement), which provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. Article 19 of the EEA Agreement provides that the Parties will review efforts on the further reduction of any type of barriers to trade in the agricultural sector. The previous agreement in the form of an exchange of letters entered into force on 1 January 2007. It provided for mutual tariff rate quotas and reductions in duty. It also included an undertaking by the Parties to resume bilateral negotiations under Article 19 of the EEA Agreement in two years’ time. The bilateral agricultural trade agreement of 2007 increased the duty-free access of Icelandic agricultural products to the EU market to 51.9 % of trade and increased the duty-free access of EU agricultural products to the Icelandic market to 66.4 % of trade. These figures demonstrate that there was ample room for further trade concessions. Therefore, the latest round of negotiations that took place on 4 July 2012, aimed at: (i) increasing the degree of liberalisation on both sides; (ii) increasing the current tariff rate quotas; and (iii) opening new tariff rate quotas for additional agricultural products. The Agreement was initialled by the Parties on 17 September 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Iceland concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products. The Agreement provides for further trade preferences for trade in agricultural products, including additional fully liberalised tariff lines. As a result almost 90 % of EU agricultural products will enter Iceland duty-free. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy, fruit, vegetable and ornamental plants, additional tariff quotas or tariff reductions have been agreed upon. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Agreement will have no impact on the expenditure side of the EU budget. The new concessions granted on imports from Iceland will likely result in a reduction of own resources through a lower collection of customs duties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current framework for trade relations between the EU and Tunisia is provided by the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, signed in 1995. The Agreement entered into force in 1998 and laid the foundation for the establishment of a Free Trade Area, including a progressive liberalisation on agriculture. Tunisia and the EU are on the verge of engaging in negotiations for establishing a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) that will notably provide for further liberalisation of trade in agriculture. The terrorist attack of 26 June 2015 in Sousse prompted a reaction from the EU on the need to further assist Tunisia in its political and economic transition, in a concrete and targeted manner, through actions that can be effective in the short-term. On 20 July 2015, the Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation in Tunisia and concrete measures which the EU could take to support it. It is within this context that the following trade measures are proposed. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to offer a temporary, unilateral duty free tariff rate quota of 35 000 tons annually for Tunisia's exports of olive oil to the Union, under the form of autonomous trade measure. Such quota will be made available for a period of two years, from 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2017. This additional volume will be opened once the existing duty free tariff rate quota of 56 700 tonnes, enshrined in the Agreement, is exhausted. Olive oil is Tunisia’s main agricultural export to the EU, and the olive oil industry is an important part of the country’s economy, providing direct and indirect employment to more than one million people and representing one-fifth of the country’s total agricultural employment. Rule of origin : the proposed autonomous trade measures should be subject to compliance by Tunisia with the Union’s relevant rules regarding the origin of products and the procedures related thereto, as well as to Tunisia’s effective administrative cooperation with the Union. Powers shall be conferred on the Commission as regards the respect of the conditions subject to which the preferential arrangements are provided for. Temporary suspension : where the Commission finds that there is sufficient evidence of a failure by Tunisia to comply with the conditions set out in the Regulation, it may adopt an implementing act suspending in whole or in part the preferential arrangements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the measures might lead to a modest net increase on imports as most of the quota increase will probably replace current inward processing trade (about 50 000 tonnes of olive oil a year under the Inward Processing regime), resulting in a reduction of the imports under this regime. The budgetary implications (of duty collections) cannot be quantified precisely at present, but are assumed to be insignificant."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the interests of clarity and transparency of EU law, the aim of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers, which has been substantially amended several times. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed Directive incorporates into EU law the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), (STCW Convention), which was the subject of a major revision at a Conference of the Parties to the STCW Convention held in Manila in 2010. Further amendments to the Convention were adopted in 2015 and 2016. As all Member States are Parties to the STCW Convention, the harmonisation of EU regulations on the training and certification of seafarers with the STCW Convention aims to ensure consistent implementation of their international commitments. Specifically, the proposal: - sets out the training rules and standards of competence to be met by candidate seafarers in order to obtain or revalidate a certificate enabling them to perform the duties for which the certificate of competency or proficiency is issued. Training for seafarers should cover proper theoretical and practical training so as to ensure that seafarers are qualified to meet security and safety standards and are able to respond to hazards and emergencies; - obliges Member States to adopt and enforce specific measures to prevent and penalise fraudulent practices related to certificates of competency or certificates of proficiency; - lays down criteria for the inspection of maritime training establishments, training programmes and courses; - contains provisions on minimum rest periods for watchkeeping personnel to improve maritime safety and the prevention of pollution at sea; - provides for measures to ensure communication between crew members of ships sailing in EU waters; - establishes common criteria for the recognition by the Member States of seafarers’ certificates issued by third countries, based on the training and certification requirements as agreed in the framework of the STCW Convention; - improves the effectiveness of the centralised mechanism for the recognition of seafarers’ certificates from third countries and enhances legal clarity with regard to the mutual recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by Member States. The proposal provides that a reassessment of third countries which provide a low number of seafarers to ships flying the flags of Member States should be performed at intervals of ten years."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Directive 2009/65/EC, each undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) must provide ‘key investor information’ to help investors understand the essential characteristics of the UCITS and make informed investment decisions. Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a key information document. The arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. The Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and to implement the other proposed measure [which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653] from 1 July 2022. As things stand, as of 1 July 2022 retail investors in UCITS would receive both a key information document in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and key investor information in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC. It is desirable to avoid a situation where retail investors receive two different pre-contractual disclosure documents in respect of the same UCITS. The proposed measures are necessary to reduce the consequences of parallel application of Directive 2009/65/EC and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. CONTENT: this proposal inserts a new article in Directive 2009/65/EC which lays down in a clear, precise and unconditional manner that, where a key information document is drawn up, provided, revised and translated for a UCITS pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, it should be considered as satisfying the requirements applicable to key investor information for the purposes of that Directive."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the European Commission is working intensively to reach an agreement between EU institutions on the reform of the CAP which will permit the reformed CAP to enter into force on 1 January 2014. The objective is to reach agreement between the Institutions on the MFF and a political agreement on the CAP reform before summer 2013. It is proposed that the new regulation on the However, transitional rules are needed to define technical arrangements which will permit a smooth adaptation to the new conditions, while at the same time ensuring continuity of the different forms of support under the CAP. · As regards direct payments, sufficient time must be allowed to Member States, and especially their paying agencies, to be well prepared and to inform farmers on new rules well in advance. Therefore, the claims for 2014 will be treated under transitional rules. · As for the second pillar (rural development), the definition of transitional rules between two programming periods represents standard practice. However, in this instance, there is also a need for certain specific transitional arrangements, notably regarding the implications the delay in the new direct payment regime has for certain rural development measures especially as regards the baseline for agri-environment and climate measures and the application of the cross compliance rules. · Transitional arrangements are also needed to ensure that Member States continue to take on new commitments for area and animal-related measures in 2014 even if resources for the current period have been exhausted. In light of the above, specific transitional rules need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament before the end of the year, amending the current CAP basic acts where necessary. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : there was no need for consultation of interested parties or an impact assessment since these adjustments follow from the state of play of the discussions between the Institutions regarding the MFF and the CAP reform. LEGAL BASIS : Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT : the proposed regulation aims to establish transitional provisions concerning the application of direct payments for the year 2014 and support for rural development. Direct payments : transitional measures: · provide for the prolongation of the main elements of the existing schemes – SPS, SAPS, coupled regimes, and also those granted as specific support under Article 68 – for claim year 2014 ; · incorporate, subject to the agreement of the European Parliament, the financial impacts of the European Council conclusions of 8 February, including the start of the external convergence process. The introduction of transitional measures implies that certain dates included in the Commission proposal for direct support after 2013 will have to be adapted accordingly in order to ensure consistency with this draft Regulation. Rural development : the proposal establishes transitional provisions to define how the current measures would be carried over to the next programming period, including their financing from the new financial envelope. In addition, these rules define which baseline and cross-compliance rules should apply in 2014. Lastly, the rules establish transitional provisions for Croatia. Transferring funds between pillars : the transitional measures also include provisions regarding the possibility of Member States transferring funds between pillars. Both the European Parliament on 13 March 2013 and the Agriculture Council on 19 March 2013 took positions on this issue. Whilst the Council took over the European Council conclusions on the MFF, Parliament increased the percentages proposed by the Commission to 15% for transfer to the second pillar and 10% for transfers to the first pillar, the latter being allowed only to those Member States with an average payment below 90% of the EU average. This proposal is without prejudice to the final decision that will be taken by the legislator on this specific issue. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the draft Regulation only implements the Commission proposals on the MFF and the CAP reform for financial year 2015 taking into account the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013. It incorporates the external convergence of the direct payments, the flexibility between the CAP pillars and the co-financing rate for rural development. · For direct payments, the European Council conclusions of 8 February 2013 correspond to a reduction of EUR 830 million to the Commission proposal in the financial year 2015 (corresponding to claim year 2014 for direct payments). · Compared to the Commission proposal, the flexibility between pillars is increased according to the European Council conclusions. It will be budgetary neutral as exactly the same amounts reduced from one Fund (EAGF or EAFRD) will be made available to the other Fund (EAGF or EAFRD). · As regards rural development, the draft Regulation has no financial impact as the rural development allocation remains unchanged. However, the distribution over time of the payments might be slightly different than otherwise but it cannot be quantified at this stage. DELEGATED ACTS : the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU’s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the rights and values programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the justice programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The general objective of the proposed rights and values programme is to protect and promote rights and values as enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by supporting civil society organisations, in order to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies. The programme has three specific objectives: (1) Promotion of equality and rights (equality and rights strand) : preventing and combating inequalities and discrimination on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and supporting comprehensive policies to promote gender equality and anti-discrimination and their mainstreaming as well policies to combat racism and all forms of intolerance; protecting and promoting the rights of the child, the rights of people with disabilities, Union citizenship rights and the right to the protection of personal data. (2) Promoting citizens' engagement and participation in the democratic life of the Union (citizens’s engagement and participation strand) : increasing citizens’ understanding of the Union, its history, cultural heritage and diversity; promoting exchange and cooperation between citizens of different countries and citizens’ civic and democratic participation. (3) Combating violence (Daphne strand) : preventing and combating all forms of violence against children, young people and women and violence against other groups at risk; and supporting and protecting the victims of such violence. The programme shall provide for and accelerate the synergies between its different specific objectives in order to increase their potential to reach citizens. To be effective, the programme shall take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. Proposed budget : the programme’s overall budget is set at EUR 641.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount shall be allocated as follows: EUR 408.7 million for the ‘equality and rights’ and ‘fight against violence’ strands; EUR 233 million for the citizen engagement and participation strand."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as set out in its 6 April Communication ""Towards a reform of the Common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe"", the migratory and refugee crisis exposed significant structural weaknesses and shortcomings in the design and implementation of the European asylum system, and of the Dublin rules in particular. The current Dublin system was not designed to ensure a sustainable sharing of responsibility for applicants across the Union. This has led to situations where a limited number of individual Member States had to deal with the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving in the Union, putting the capacities of their asylum systems under strain and leading to some disregard of EU rules. In addition, the effectiveness of the Dublin system is undermined by a set of complex and disputable rules on the determination of responsibility as well as lengthy procedures. In particular, this is the case for the current rules which provide for a shift of responsibility between Member States after a given time. It is clear that the Dublin system must be reformed, both to simplify it and enhance its effectiveness in practice, and to be equal to the task of dealing with situations when Member States' asylum systems are faced with disproportionate pressure. This proposal on the reform of the Dublin III Regulation is part of a first set of legislative proposals the Commission is presenting in the context of a major reform of the Common European Asylum System. These proposals include: this draft Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person; a draft Regulation which aims to extend the scope of the Eurodac Regulation to include the possibility for Member States to store and search data belonging to third-country nationals or stateless persons who are not applicants for international protection and found irregularly staying in the EU; a draft Regulation on the European Union Agency for Asylum which aims to strengthen the mandate of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). A second stage of legislative proposals reforming the Asylum Procedures and Qualification Directives, as well as the Reception Conditions Directive is due to follow to ensure the full reform of all parts of the EU asylum system. CONTENT: this proposal is a recast of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third country national or a stateless person (""the Dublin III Regulation""). A summary of the main provisions is as follows: New fairness mechanism : a new automated system will allow for the registration of all asylum applications made in the EU and the monitoring on a daily basis of the number of applications made in each Member State. The new system will automatically establish when a country is handling a disproportionate number of asylum applications. This reference number is identified on the basis of a key, taking account of the country's population size, and the size of its economy. Once the fairness mechanism is triggered, all new applications in the Member State concerned are allocated to other Member States, after an admissibility check has been carried out, until the number of applications is back below the 150% level. The fairness mechanism will also factor in the effort being made by a Member State to resettle those in need of international protection direct from a third country. Criteria for the reference key : the reference key is based on two criteria with equal 50% weighting: the size of the population, and the total GDP of a Member State. The number of applications for which a given Member State is responsible and the numbers of persons effectively resettled by a Member State form the basis for the calculation using the reference key and threshold. NB: a Member State will also have the option to temporarily not take part in the allocation. In that case, it would have to make a financial solidarity contribution of EUR 250 000 to the Member State receiving an applicant for whom it would otherwise have been responsible under the fairness mechanism. Streamlined procedures : procedures will be streamlined, in particular through shorter time limits for the different steps of the determination procedure, transfers and access to the asylum procedure: take charge requests, asking another Member State to take over responsibility for an application, have to be sent within one month and a decision taken by the receiving country within one month of receipt of the request. No reply will be tantamount to accepting the request; requests from one Member State to another to take back an applicant for whom the latter is responsible and who has absconded ('take back requests') will be transformed into simple take back notifications. Such notifications have to be submitted within two weeks of registration and do not require a reply, only a confirmation of receipt. All Member States will be under a clear obligation to take back applicants they are responsible for; appeals against transfer decisions will be dealt with within 15 days; proper registration of all asylum applications in the EU should help detect multiple applications and prevent irregular secondary movements. Obligations for applicants : the new system introduces clear legal obligations for applicants: explicit obligation for applicants to apply for asylum in the Member State of first irregular entry or in the Member State where a person has stayed legally prior to the application for asylum. This will make clear that applicants do not have the right to choose in which Member State they submit their application. In case an asylum applicant does not comply with this new obligation, Member States must examine the application in an accelerated procedure; applicants will also be obliged to provide all relevant information for determining the Member State responsible for their claim in a timely manner and failure to comply will have proportionate procedural consequences, such as the preclusion of information submitted unjustifiably late; to discourage secondary movements, applicants will only be entitled to material reception rights in the country where he or she is required to be present, with the exception of emergency healthcare; an obligation for the Member State of application to check whether the applicant comes from a first country of asylum or a safe third country. The Member State making this admissibility check will be considered responsible for these applications. The Member State of application must also check whether the applicant comes from a safe country of origin or presents a security risk, in which case they have to examine the application through an accelerated procedure. Best interests of children and unaccompanied minors : under the new system, the rights of unaccompanied minors will be enhanced and the assessment of the best interests of the child reinforced. The proposal clarifies that the Member State where the minor first lodged his or her application for international protection will be responsible, unless it is demonstrated that this is not in the best interests of the minor. Appeals will be accelerated but will have automatic suspensive effects, meaning no transfers will be carried out while the appeal is ongoing. The rights of unaccompanied minors have been strengthened through better defining the principle of the best interests of the child and by setting out a mechanism for making a best interests of the child-determination in all circumstances implying the transfer of a minor. New safeguards for asylum seekers : reinforced family reunification : the right to family reunification of asylum seekers present on the EU territory will be reinforced and the scope will be extended to also include siblings of an applicant as well as families formed in transit, after leaving the country of origin but before arrival on the territory of the Member State; detention : under the new system, the detention period for the purpose of transfers has been significantly reduced, from six to four weeks. Review clause : the Commission will review the functioning of the fairness mechanism 18 months after entry into force of the Regulation and annually from then on in order to assess whether the objective of ensuring a proportionate sharing of responsibility between Member States and of relieving disproportionate pressure on certain Member States is met. This review will in particular verify that the threshold for triggering the mechanism is effective. Territorial provisions : the United Kingdom and Ireland may participate in this proposal, but are not required to do so, in accordance with the relevant Protocols attached to the Treaties. As regards Denmark, it has an opt out and does not participate in justice and home affairs measures. However, Denmark applies the current Regulation on the basis of an international agreement concluded in 2006. Under that agreement, Denmark may opt in to the recast Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial resources necessary to support the implementation of this proposal amount to EUR 1828.6 million foreseen for the period 2017-2020. This would cover the transfer costs once the corrective allocation mechanism has been triggered for the benefit of a Member State, the establishment and operation of the IT system for the registration and automatic allocation of asylum applicants."

The United Kingdom has also requested the recognition of the equivalence as regards the checks on practices for the maintenance of varieties carried out in the United Kingdom pursuant to those Directives. The Commission has carried out a review of the relevant legislation in the United Kingdom. It has concluded (i) that the requirements and the system in force are equivalent to those of the Union and offer the same guarantees as the Union system; (ii) that the checks on practices for the maintenance of such varieties carried out in the United Kingdom afford the same assurances as those carried out by the Member States. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the equivalence of field inspections, and of checks on practices for the maintenance of seed-producing crops of cereal species and the equivalence of the seed produced have been recognised. This recognition is based on an examination of the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and system in place offer the same guarantees as the Union's system.

The new Regulation was to have superseded the various acts incorporated in it. In the meantime the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. · Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts). · Article 291 of the TFEU allows the legislator to confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed (implementing acts).

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid ""in beneficiary countries"", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the EIDHR and on the parallel proposal amending the DCI."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND : on 19 January 2009 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Member Countries of the Andean Community, which resulted in a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. The Agreement was initialled on 23 March 2011. The Agreement includes a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility to re-instate the MFN customs duty rate when, as a result of a trade liberalisation, imports take place in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. Furthermore, the Agreement also incorporates a Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas according to which, until 1 January 2020, preferential customs duties can be suspended when a certain annual import volume is reached. In order for these measures to be operational, the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism should be incorporated in EU law, and the procedural aspects of their application as well as the rights of interested parties need to be specified. This is the purpose of the proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT : the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the Stabilisation Mechanism of the EU- Colombia and Peru Free Trade Agreement. 1) Principles on the imposition of safeguard measures : a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with this Regulation where a product originating in Columbia or Peru is, as a result of tariff concessions on that product under the Agreement, being imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the Union industry producing a like or directly competitive product. Safeguard measures may take one of the following forms: a suspension of further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Tariff Elimination Schedule of the European Union set out in Annex I to the Agreement; an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of: (i) the most-favoured-nation (""MFN"") applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or (ii) the base rate as specified in the Tariff Elimination Schedule of the European Union set out in Annex I to the Agreement. Initiation of proceedings : an investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to above, to justify such initiation. The request to initiate an investigation shall generally contain the following information: the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment. An investigation may also be initiated in the event that there is a surge of imports concentrated in one or several Member States, provided that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the conditions for initiation are met. The proposal makes provision for the procedures for initiating an investigation and the conditions under which the latter may be done. Investigation : following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation, which shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of its initiation. That time limit may be extended by a further period of three months in exceptional circumstances such as the involvement of an unusually high number of parties, or complex market situations. Prior surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in Colombia or Peru is such that it could lead to a serious threat to the Union market, imports of that product may be subject to prior surveillance measures. Such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in the text. Prior surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Imposition of provisional safeguard measures : provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in Colombia or Peru have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty. Provisional measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure, including on imperative grounds of urgency. Provisional measures shall be shall not apply for more than 200 days. Imposition of definitive measures : where the facts as finally established show that conditions regarding a serious threat to Union industry are met the Commission shall invite the authorities of Colombia or Peru to hold consultations in accordance with the Agreement. Where no satisfactory solution has been reached within 45 days, the Commission may adopt a decision imposing definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure. The text also contains provisions on the termination of investigation and proceeding without measure. Duration and review of safeguard measures : it is provided that a safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed two years, and may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the Union industry is adjusting.. The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. Confidentiality and transparency : the text contains provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information received pursuant to the Regulation. Information shall in any case be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information. At the same time, when initiating an investigation, provisions are made to ensure transparency, and interested parties and representatives of Colombia and Peru may inspect all information made available to the Commission, which shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable. There ate other provisions to ensure transparency, such as such as the Commission’s obligation to ensure password-protected online access to the non-confidential file through which all information which is not confidential shall be disseminated. The European Parliament shall be granted access to this online platform. 2) Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas: for bananas originating in Colobia and Peru (fresh Bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category ""BA"" in the Schedule of the EU Party set out in Annex I to the Agreement, a stabilisation mechanism shall apply until 1 January 2020. A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports of products as indicated in the Annex to the Regulation. Once the trigger volume for either Colombia or Peru is met during the corresponding calendar year, the Commission may, in accordance with the examination procedure, temporarily suspend the preferential customs duty applied to products of the corresponding origin during that same year for a period of time not exceeding three months, and not going beyond the end of the calendar year. In case the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, the Commission shall apply the lesser of: (i) the base rate of customs duty or (ii) the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken. In case the Commission applies these actions, it shall immediately enter into consultations with the affected country y (either Colombia or Peru or both) to analyse and evaluate the situation on the basis of factual available data. These measures may be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the common fisheries policy (CFP) seeks to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term, to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and to implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. Scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and from the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean’s Scientific Advisory Committee (GFCM — SAC) has indicated that the exploitation of anchovy and sardine stocks in the Adriatic Sea exceeds the levels required to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The vast majority are being caught by Italy and Croatia, in the northern part of the Adriatic. Currently, small pelagic fisheries in the Adriatic Sea are governed by several legal frameworks, at national, EU and international level. This proposal addresses the problem of overexploitation of small pelagic stocks due to an unsustainable fishery and ineffective governance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option was the one which called for an EU Regulation to manage small pelagic fisheries. This option should lead to an improved conservation status of anchovy and sardine, which would ultimately result in a healthier and more sustainable fishing sector dependent on this resource, with better salaries for individual fishers and greater profitability overall compared to the status quo. CONTENT: the proposed plan seeks to replenish stocks such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel and horse mackerel and contribute to their sustainable use, as well as to establish a simpler and more comprehensive management framework. The plan should: facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation by providing a basis for derogations in certain circumscribed situations; enable regionalisation to be used, whereby Member States around sea basins are involved in the conception and design of management rules for the interested parties. The multiannual-plan will apply to all EU fishing vessels irrespective of their overall participation in fishing in the Adriatic Sea (in EU and international waters). It shall include: target fishing mortalities expressed in ranges for each of the stocks, where available, which would be the basis for setting annual catch limits for those stocks; safeguard measures to give a framework to restore stocks when they fall below safe biological limits; control provisions are provided on the vessel monitoring system, prior notification, electronic logbooks and designated ports. Regarding electronic logbooks and the vessel monitoring system, the provisions included in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 are extended to cover all vessels over eight metres in length, to improve control of the fisheries covered by the multiannual plan. The plan should be evaluated every five years on the basis of scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that, under certain conditions, field inspections carried out in the third countries listed in its Annex I on certain seed-producing crops are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that, under certain conditions, seed of certain cereal species produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law. Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022. On 29 January 2016, Bolivia submitted a request to the Commission to consider seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia as offering the same assurances as regards identity, health and quality as seed produced in the EU on the basis of official controls carried out by the competent authorities of that country. Following this request, the Commission assessed the relevant Bolivian legislation and carried out an audit of the Bolivian seed production and certification system. The Commission identified shortcomings and made recommendations to Bolivia. As Bolivia addressed these shortcomings by 30 November 2018, the Commission recognised that the Bolivian system in place offered the same assurance as the EU system. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to grant equivalence in respect of field inspections of seed producing crops of sorghum, maize and sunflower carried out in Bolivia and in respect of seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia and officially certified by its authorities. As Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022, it is proposed to extend by 7 years (until 31 December 2029) the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision, in order to avoid any risk of disruption of seed imports into the Union. The proposal will stimulate seed trade between Bolivia and the EU. Granting the EU equivalence would therefore contribute to the maintenance of the continuous supply of high quality seed in the EU. It could also make it more attractive for EU-based companies to invest in the agricultural development of Bolivia given that the EU would become an export market."
7936EP8,"""""Import of cultural goods""""",0.057,0.747,0.9,0.875,0.212,0.866,0.817,0.615,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to set out the conditions and procedure for the entry of cultural goods into the customs territory of the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: currently, there are no common rules regarding the import of cultural goods from third countries, except Council Regulation (EC) No 1210/2003 concerning certain specific restrictions on economic and financial relations with Iraq and Council Regulation (EU) No 36/2012 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria, which provide for a prohibition of trade in cultural goods with these countries. The initiative aims to complement those two measures and also the existing EU legislation on the export of cultural goods (Regulation (EC) No 116/2009). It aims to prevent the import and storage in the EU of cultural goods illicitly exported from a third country, thereby reducing trafficking in cultural goods, combatting terrorism financing and protecting cultural heritage, especially archaeological objects in source countries affected by armed conflict. The proposal is a follow-up to the 2015 European Agenda on Security and the 2016 Action Plan to step up the fight against the financing of terrorism. It also responds to the European Parliament’s resolution of 30 April 2015 on the destruction of cultural sites by the Islamic State group, which called for strong actions to disrupt the illicit trade in cultural property. At the global level, in March 2017, the G7 culture ministers called on all states to ban the trade in looted cultural property trafficked across borders. In July 2017, G20 leaders affirmed their willingness to put an end to sources of terrorist financing such as looting and smuggling of antiquities. Lastly, the fight against the illicit trade in cultural goods will be a key European action during 2018, European Year of Cultural Heritage. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the selected options would prevent the import and storage in the EU of cultural goods illegally exported from a third country. They involve: raising awareness of potential buyers , including tourists and travellers, as well as of customs and other law enforcement authorities; a regulation providing for customs control measures applying to cultural objects declared for release for free circulation or placement under other special customs procedures (such as free zones), with the exception of goods in transit. CONTENT: the proposal concerns the import into the EU of cultural goods - as defined in the 1995 International institute for the unification of private law (Unidroit) convention on stolen or illegally exported cultural objects – of a minimum age of 250. For these cultural goods, the person who seeks to introduce them into the Union's customs territory must provide the following documents in order to prove licit provenance, i.e. legality of export from the source country: for archaeological objects, parts of monuments that have been dismembered and for rare manuscripts and incunabula, the person must apply to the competent authority designated for this purpose by the Member State of entry for an import licence, by providing proof of licit export of the goods from the source country; for all other cultural goods , the person must submit to customs a signed statement (affidavit) certifying that the goods were legally exported from the source country, accompanied by a standard Object ID document, describing the object in detail. Customs register and keep a copy of these documents. The proposal also calls on the Member States to: organise cooperation between their competent authorities and provides for the future development of an electronic database to facilitate the storage and exchange of information, in particular importer statements and importer licences issued; foresee penalties for infringements to this Regulation in accordance with their internal legal systems; organise appropriate training sessions for the authorities that they have designated for the implementation of the Regulation, as well as awareness raising campaigns in order to inform potential buyers about the legal framework and dissuade them from purchasing cultural goods from countries thirds whose provenance is not established. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stability and Growth Pact has been further strengthened by Regulation No 1175/2011 and Regulation (EU) No 1177/2011 on the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Regulation (EC) No 1173/2011 on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area added a system of effective, preventive and gradual enforcement mechanisms in the form of financial sanctions for the Member States whose currency is the euro. These provisions have created a more robust framework at the level of the Union for the surveillance of national economic policies. The Treaty allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area that go beyond the provisions applicable to all Member States in order to ensure the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. Strong public finances are best ensured at the planning stage and gross errors should be identified as early as possible . Setting-up a common budgetary timeline for Member States whose currency is the euro should better synchronize the key steps in the preparation of national budgets, thus contributing to the effectiveness of the European semester for budgetary policy coordination. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 136 in conjunction with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed regulation builds on what has already been agreed in the ‘Six Pack’ set of legislative measures which will enter into force in mid-December 2011. It contains provisions to enhance both the coordination and the surveillance of budgetary processes for all euro area Member States: · complementing the European semester with a common budgetary timeline; · complementing the multilateral surveillance system of budgetary policies with additional monitoring requirements in order to ensure that Union policy recommendations in the budgetary area are appropriately integrated in the national budgetary preparations; · complementing the procedure for correction of a Member State's excessive deficit by a closer monitoring of budgetary policies of Member States subject to an excessive deficit procedure in order to secure a timely durable correction of excessive deficits. The proposed regulation would require Member States whose currency is the euro to present their draft budgets at the same time each year (by 15 April) and gives the Commission the right to assess and, if necessary, issue an opinion on them. The Commission could request that these drafts be revised, should it consider them to be seriously non-compliant with the policy obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. All of this would be done publically to ensure full transparency. The Eurogroup shall discuss opinions of the Commission on the national budgetary plans and the budgetary situation and prospects in the euro area as a whole on the basis of the overall assessment made by the Commission The proposal also contains new monitoring requirements – based on an obligation to communicate information to the Commission – to allow assessments to be made about the content and direction of fiscal policy at any point while a Member State is under an Excessive Deficit Procedure. Member States of the euro area must have in place an independent fiscal council for monitoring the implementation of national fiscal rules and base their budgets on independent macroeconomic forecasts. In order to enhance the dialogue between the Union institutions, in particular the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and to ensure greater transparency and accountability, the competent committee of the European Parliament may offer the opportunity to the Member State concerned by a Commission recommendation to participate in an exchange of views. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no budgetary implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council introduced a series of measures aimed at enhancing investor protection and rebuilding consumer trust in the financial services industry by increasing transparency in the retail investment market. It requires manufacturers of packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) to produce a Key Information Document (KID). The Regulation empowers the European Supervisory Authorities to prepare regulatory technical standards specifying the elements of the KID. On 6 April 2016, the ESAs jointly submitted the draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on the KID for PRIIPs to the Commission. The draft RTS were endorsed by the Commission on 30 June 2016 by adopting the Delegated Regulation on KID. During the scrutiny period, the Council raised no objections to the Commission Delegated Regulation. However, on 14 September 2016, the European Parliament rejected it. The European Parliament called on the Commission to review the provisions relating to multi-option PRIIPs, performance scenarios and comprehension alert. Moreover, the European Parliament and a large majority of Member States asked the Commission to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. Given the exceptional circumstances that have led to delays in the adoption of the Delegated Regulation and in order to reduce legal uncertainty and give more time to PRIIPs manufacturers to prepare for the application of the new rules, the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 shall be deferred. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 by 12 months, until 1 January 2018, in order to reduce legal uncertainty and give more time to PRIIPs manufacturers to prepare for the application of the new rules."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the decline in passenger demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, air carriers have made major changes to their schedules since 1 March 2020, which have resulted in a slot utilisation rate at coordinated airports falling far below the 80% threshold imposed by the Slot Regulation. This situation is likely to continue to negatively impact air carriers up to and including winter 2024/2025. For the period starting after more than a year of waiving the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule (from 1 February 2020 to 27 March 2021), which preserves air carriers’ 2019 grandfathered slots until the end of the winter 2021/2022 scheduling season, the Commission proposes to establish a pathway to return to a normal application of the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule. The return to normal should not be sudden to avoid destabilising the aviation market to the detriment of air carriers, connectivity, EU consumers, and the environment. It should take place in line with future increases in traffic levels toward 2019 levels or by a stabilisation of air traffic to a new market situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that from the start of the summer 2021 scheduling period, the normal application of the slot utilisation requirements of the Slot Regulation should reapply, but that the rate should be set at 40/60 % instead of 80/20 %. Relief should be targeted at air carriers whose intention is to operate their grandfathered slots as soon as demand sufficiently recovers and flights are once again economically viable. Consequently, slot series newly allocated to an air carrier for the first time would not be covered by the planned relief. The proposal foresees a deadline for air carriers to return unwanted slots to the coordinator if they want to benefit from the relief. A deadline of three weeks before the planned operational date for that slot would give airports and other airport service providers visibility on the required capacity and the volume of operations that they are expected to make available adequate infrastructure, facilities and staff. The proposal also clarifies under what circumstances coordinators could withdraw slots from air carriers. The Commission could adopt delegated acts to further extend the period during which the relief applies if the COVID-19 pandemic is not resolved and continues to have a negative impact on the air transport sector, including on historical grandfather rights."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fitness check of EU consumer and marketing law, which also covers Directive 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests, demonstrated that the risk of infringements of Union law affecting the collective interests of consumers is increasing due to economic globalisation and digitalisation. In view of the increase in cross-border trade, it is increasingly common for such infringements to affect consumers in several Member States. The absence of an EU-wide collective redress mechanism is of particular practical relevance to consumer protection, as shown by concrete cases, including the diesel emissions case. In its resolution of 2 February 2012, the European Parliament stressed the need for a horizontal EU approach to collective redress focusing on breaches of consumer rights, based on a common set of principles respecting national legal traditions and providing safeguards against abusive litigation. In this context, this proposal aims to modernise and replace Directive 2009/22/EC on injunctions. It is presented together with the proposal on targeted amendments to four EU consumer law Directives as part of the ""New Deal for Consumers"". IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is to tighten the rules on sanctions, to improve the efficiency of the injunction procedure and to add other measures concerning collective redress for consumers. Stronger mechanisms for collective redress would ensure a higher level of consumer protection in mass harm situations and reduce consumer detriment. As concerns efficiency, all options could lead to initial familiarisation costs, but also to savings for compliant traders. CONTENT: the new Directive replacing Directive 2009/22/EC would aim to ensure that ""qualified entities"" - for example consumer organisations – may seek representative actions to protect the collective interests of consumers. For example, in a Dieselgate-type scenario, victims of unfair commercial practices, such as misleading advertising by car manufacturers, will be able to obtain remedies collectively through a representative action under this proposal. Such collective redress was previously not provided under Union law. The proposed new Directive: covers all infringements by traders of Union law that harm or may harm the collective interests of consumers in a variety of sectors such as financial services, energy, telecommunications, health and the environment; enables qualified entities to be able to seek measures aimed at eliminating the continuing effects of the infringement. These measures should take the form of a redress order obligating the trader to provide for, inter alia, compensation, repair, replacement, price reduction, contract termination or reimbursement of the price paid, as appropriate and as available under national laws. These qualified entities will have to satisfy minimum reputational criteria (they must be properly established, not for profit and have a legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with the relevant EU law). For compensatory collective redress actions, qualified entities would also be required to disclose to the courts or administrative authorities their financial capacity and the origin of their funds supporting the action and to ensure that there are no conflicts of interests or risks of abuse in a given case; sets out the rules requiring the infringing trader to adequately inform the consumers concerned about the final injunction orders, final decisions on measures eliminating continuing effects of the infringements. This provision ensures consumers' awareness about the breach of law and their redress opportunities; requires Member States to ensure that all representative actions are treated with due diligence and that representative actions seeking an interim injunction order are dealt with under an accelerated procedure, while avoiding that procedural costs become a financial barrier to representative actions; favours collective out-of-court settlements, under the control of the courts or administrative authorities. If a decision finding an infringement has become final, it should be irrefutable evidence in any subsequent redress action in the same Member State; ensures the application of effective, dissuasive and proportionate sanctions in cases where a defendant does not comply with a final decision of a court or administrative authority in a representative action."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 established a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights which became operational on 1 March 2007. The objective of the Agency is to provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union and its Member States, when implementing Union law. In order for the Agency to carry out its tasks properly, a Multiannual Framework is to be adopted by the Council every five years, determining the thematic areas of the Agency's work. The first Multiannual Framework covered the period from 2007-2012. The current Multiannual Framework (2013-2017) expires at the end of 2017. The Agency refers to fundamental rights as defined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. The Agency is not a legislative or a standard setting body. Its work is instrumental in providing data, assistance and expertise on fundamental rights issues to support evidence-based policy making across the EU, thereby also contributing to the development of a culture of fundamental rights in the EU. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish the Multiannual Framework for the Agency for Fundamental Rights for the years 2018-2022. Thematic areas: this proposal confirms the relevance for the next five year period of the thematic areas laid down for the Agency for 2013-2017. No theme is withdrawn. The Commission proposes to remove the exclusion of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and adding a reference to police cooperation. In addition, within the theme related to Roma integration, social inclusion aspects would be strengthened. The thematic areas proposed for the Multiannual Framework of the Agency for the years 2018-2022 are therefore the following: Complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies: the Multiannual Framework should include provisions with a view of ensuring complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies, offices and agencies, as well as with the Council of Europe and other international organisations active in the field of fundamental rights. The most relevant Union agencies and bodies in relation to this Multiannual Framework are: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any direct implication for the EU budget. The Agency will develop projects within the areas of its Multiannual Framework and within the human and financial resources in the Agency's annual budget as adopted by the budgetary authority. This will be detailed in the Agency's programming documents."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 , the Commission decided that cohesion policy should remain an essential element of the next financial package and underlined its pivotal role in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy. It proposed a number of important changes to the way cohesion policy is designed and implemented. Concentrating funding on a smaller number of priorities better linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, focusing on results, monitoring progress towards agreed objectives, increasing the use of conditionalities and simplifying the delivery are among the major hallmarks of the proposal This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The Cohesion Fund helps Member States whose GNI per inhabitant is less than 90% of the EU27 average in making investments in TEN-T transport networks and the environment. Part of the Cohesion Fund allocation (EUR 10 billion) will be ring-fenced to finance core transport networks under the ""Connecting Europe"" Facility. The Cohesion Fund can also support projects related to energy, as long as they clearly present a benefit to the environment, for example by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: options were assessed in particular in relation to the Cohesion Fund contribution to investing in basic infrastructure in transport and environment. Various ways of making funding conditional on a sound macro-fiscal framework were assessed, including: (i) the status quo, with a weak ex-post conditionality which has never been applied; (ii) a strengthened ex post conditionality; (iii) ex ante conditionality, which would require the fulfilment of preconditions before the adoption of the programmes. An evolution of the current system best fulfils the criteria of ownership, transparency and predictability, while at the same time ensuring that the effectiveness of growth-enhancing investments is not undermined by the pursuit of unsound fiscal policies. Such a procedure implies suspension of part or all of commitments in the case of repeated breaches. LEGAL BASIS: Article 177 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation determines the scope of intervention of the Cohesion Fund. It includes an article on scope defining the general areas for intervention within the area of transport and environment. The scope of intervention is also defined by a negative list of activities which will not be eligible for support, and a list of investment priorities. Environment : the Cohesion Fund will support investment in climate change adaptation and risk prevention, investment in the water and waste sectors and the urban environment. Energy : investment in energy is also eligible for support, provided it has positive environmental benefits. Therefore investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy are also supported. Transport : the Cohesion Fund will contribute to investments in the Trans-European Transport Network, as well as low-carbon transport systems and urban transport. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission’s proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework includes EUR 376 billion for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. The proposed budget (in billion euros) is broken down as follows: Less developed regions EUR 162.6 Transition regions: EUR 38.9 More developed regions: EUR 53.1 Territorial cooperation: EUR 11.7 Cohesion fund: EUR 68.7 Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 0.926. Facility for transport, energy and ICT: EUR 40 billion (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring-fenced inside the Cohesion Fund)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: the powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), on the one hand, and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts), on the other. In the context of the alignment of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 to the new rules of the TFEU, powers currently conferred to the Commission by that Regulation have been reclassified into measures of delegated nature and measures of implementing nature. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: there was no need for an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to: identify the delegated powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and to establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts; adapt certain provisions to the decision-making procedures of the TFEU. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."
9270EP8,"""""Insurance of motor vehicles""""",0.743,0.747,0.88,0.896,0.154,0.866,0.791,0.788,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to strengthen EU rules on motor insurance to better protect victims of motor vehicle accidents. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the first EU Directive on motor insurance was adopted in 1972, with the dual objectives of protecting victims of motor vehicle accidents (with or without a cross-border element), and facilitating the free movement of motor vehicles between Member States. Five motor insurance Directives since 1972 progressively strengthened the Directive and enhanced its provisions; they were consolidated into Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. Motor insurance also has an impact on the free movement of persons, goods and vehicles. It should therefore be a key objective of the Union action in the field of financial services to reinforce and consolidate the internal market for motor insurance. The evaluation of the functioning of Directive 2009/103/EC concluded that the Directive was working well overall. However, four areas have been identified where targeted amendments would be appropriate: (i) compensation of victims of accidents in cases of insolvency of an insurance undertaking, (ii) minimum obligatory amounts of insurance cover, (iii) checks by Member States on vehicle insurance and (iv) the use of policyholders’ claims history statements by a new insurance undertaking. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined several options for each of the problems identified. The proposed amendments aim at reducing uninsured driving, potentially reducing motor insurance premiums, and at improving the level of protection of victims of motor accidents, potentially benefitting all citizens in the EU. The proposal avoids risking large potential increases of premiums of motor insurance. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Directive 2009/103/EC on motor insurance introduces the following changes: Scope : the proposal clarifies the scope of the Directive in the light of recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union has clarified that motor vehicles are intended normally to serve as means of transport, irrespective of such vehicle's characteristics, and it has clarified that the use of such vehicles covers any use of a vehicle consistent with its normal function as a means of transport, irrespective of the terrain on which the motor vehicle is used and of whether it is stationary or in motion. Uninsured driving : Member States shall be authorised to carry out insurance checks of vehicles normally based in the territory of another Member State and of vehicles normally based in the territory of a third country entering their territory from the territory of another Member state only if, they are non-discriminatory necessary and proportionate, form part of a general system of checks on the national territory and do not require stopping of the vehicle for the purpose of such a check. Those checks have to be conducted in accordance with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. Minimum level of protection : in order to ensure the same minimum level of protection at EU level for victims of motor vehicle accidents, the proposal harmonises at EU level the minimum levels of compulsory cover for personal injury and material damage, without prejudice to any higher amounts of cover prescribed by the Member States. The Commission may adopt delegated acts to update, every five years, the harmonised minimum amounts of cover for victims in line with inflation. Insolvency of the insurer : each Member State should entrust a body set up for this purpose with the task of providing compensation for material or personal injuries caused by a vehicle insured by an undertaking which is insolvent or where, after a period of three months from the date on which the injured party submitted a claim for compensation, the insurer has not provided a reasoned reply. The injured parties would be compensated by the body in their Member State of residence. That body would be entitled to claim reimbursement from the body in the Member State where the insurance undertaking which produced the contract is established, with the latter assuming ultimate responsibility. Claims history statements : the proposal harmonises the statements relating to successful third party liability claims against the policyholder in the last five years. It ensures non-discriminatory treatment of the claims history by insurance undertakings, irrespective of nationality or previous Member State of residence of a citizen."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 November 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Japan. The negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan have been successfully concluded. The Agreement provides that single distilled shochu, as defined in the Liquor Tax Law of Japan, produced by pot still and bottled in Japan, shall be allowed to be placed on the market of the European Union in traditional bottles of sizes of four go and one sho, corresponding to nominal quantities of 720 ml and of 1800 ml, respectively, provided that other applicable legal requirements of the European Union are fulfilled. Directive 2007/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that spirit drinks put up in pre-packages may only be placed on the Union market if they are prepacked in the nominal quantities listed in section 1 of the Annex to that Directive. For spirit drinks, section 1 of the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC refers to nine nominal quantities on the interval from 100 ml to 2000 ml. These nominal quantities do not include 720 ml and 1800 ml, the nominal quantities in which single distilled shochu produced by pot still is bottled and marketed in Japan. A derogation from the nominal quantities set out in the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC for spirit drinks is therefore necessary to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the Union market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a trade sustainability impact assessment of the EPA between the EU and Japan was carried out by the external contractor “London School of Economics Enterprises”. The details of it are provided in Commission proposal for a Council Decision on the signing on behalf of the European Union, of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan. CONTENT: the proposal aims at introducing a derogation from Union rules concerning bottle sizes, for single distilled shochu, a spirit drink produced by pot still and bottled in Japan that is traditionally sold in bottles of sizes of four go or one sho that correspond to nominal quantities of 720 ml (one go corresponds to 180 ml) and 1800 ml, respectively, and that are currently not among the nominal quantities permitted in the Union under Directive 2007/45/EC laying down rules on nominal quantities of prepacked products. This derogation needs to be introduced by an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the market in all Member States simultaneously upon the entry into force of the Agreement."
5278EP9,"""""Rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers""""",0.435,0.934,0.959,0.836,0.614,0.88,0.87,0.878,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve the functioning of the comitology procedures. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on comitology sets out the mechanism for the control of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers by Member States. Under the most frequently used procedure, the so-called “examination procedure”, the Commission representatives submit draft implementing acts to a committee composed of representatives from the Member States, which gives its opinion, generally by vote. The appeal committee was introduced in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 in order to elevate the debate, in particular in case the examination committee did not deliver an opinion, to a more political level. The Commission has found itself in the past years in a situation where it is legally obliged to take an authorisation decision in the absence of a qualified majority of the Member States taking position (either in favour or against) in the committee. This 'no opinion' situation is in the Commission's view particularly problematic when it concerns politically sensitive matters of direct impact on citizens and businesses, for instance in the field of health and safety of humans, animals or plants (e.g. GMOs or glyphosate). The Commission considered that Member States should, in these specific situations, also assume their responsibilities in the decision-making process to a greater extent. It is for this reason that it has proposed amendments to improve the functioning of the comitology procedures at the level of the appeal committee in order to ensure wider political accountability and ownership of politically sensitive implementing acts. CONTENT: this proposal provides for targeted and limited amendments to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 and thus relates to implementing acts only. The Commission proposes to: amend the voting rules for the appeal committee in order to reduce the risk of a no opinion scenario and to clarify the positions of the Member States. To this end, the proposal stipulates that only Member States which are present or represented, and which do not abstain, should be considered as participating Member States for the calculation of the qualified majority. In order to ensure that the voting outcome is representative a vote should only be considered valid if a simple majority of the Member States are participating members of the appeal committee; provide the possibility of a further referral to the appeal committee at ministerial level where no opinion is delivered. The changes proposed aim at reducing the risk of no opinion outcomes at the appeal committee level and at facilitating the decision-making and to ensure the political ownership of Member States of certain sensitive decisions; increase the transparency of the comitology procedure by proposing that the votes of the Member States' representatives taken in the appeal committee be made public (they are currently confidential); enable the Commission to formally refer specific cases after a no opinion outcome in the appeal committee for a non-binding opinion to the Council, with a view to obtaining its political orientation on the implications of the no opinion outcome."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in June 2017, the Commission published a comprehensive fitness check evaluation on reporting and monitoring of EU environment policy and drew up an action plan. This evaluation covered 181 reporting obligations found in 58 pieces of EU environmental legislation. It was found that there is room for improvement on some cross-cutting issues (such as streamlining for a process that is more similar in all Member States) and for specific pieces of legislation: Directive 2007/2/EC (INSPIRE Directive) - Infrastructure for spatial information; Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC (i.e. Birds and Habitats Directive); Directive 2010/63/EC (Animal Testing Directive); Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register Regulation (E-PRTR)); Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 (Timber Regulation); Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 (CITES); Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (FLEGT Regulation). Issues addressed in the proposal are as follows: the relevance and need for certain reporting obligations is no longer clear; the timing and frequency for reporting obligations does not meet major policy cycle needs; the extending of access to information and the sharing with the public; the roles of the Commission and European agencies are not always clear and explicit; aligning the content, timing and procedures with the evaluation cycle under the Better Regulation agenda. The proposal is therefore designed for the purpose of regulatory fitness and simplification. CONTENT: this proposal for revision of several existing legislative acts falls under the Commission’s Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT). The objectives of this ‘alignment’ proposal are: (i) to improve the evidence base for the implementation of EU environmental policy; (ii) to increase transparency for the public and; (iii) to simplify reporting in order to reduce the administrative burden. The proposal has been developed with a view to ensuring a coherent approach across the different legislative acts, as appropriate: improving transparency and subsidiarity (in 8 legal acts); aligning the timing of reporting (in 3 legal acts); clarifying the role that the Commission and, in some cases, the European Environment Agency plays in the reporting processes (in 8 legal acts); providing factual data for future evaluations (in 5 legal acts)."
1144EP7,"""""Restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment""""",0.842,0.901,0.877,0.323,0.303,0.88,0.892,0.829,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to clarify Directive 2002/95/EC restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS Directive), in order to simplify its implementation, improve its application at national level, adapt it to scientific and technical progress and ensure that it is coherent with other legal texts of the Commission. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: uncertainty about the scope of the Directive, lack of clarity on legal provisions and definitions as well as disparities in Member States' approaches to product compliance and potential duplication of procedure with other pieces of EU legislation such as REACH, generate unnecessary administrative costs. If the RoHS Directive is not reviewed, environmental benefits reaped from the legislation will remain sub-optimal. Uncertainty among manufacturers about legal requirements for demonstrating compliance with the RoHS Directive and about enforcement methodologies in the 27 Member States will persist, maintaining or increasing administrative burden. The RoHS recast will enhance its complementarity and coherence with other relevant Community legislation, such as the ""Marketing of Products Package"" (regarding definitions and enforcement), REACH (regarding the use of substances), the Energy-using Products (EuP) Directive regarding the design of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), and legislation related to management of waste from EEE. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden and make the RoHS Directive more cost effective. CONTENT: the basic objectives and mechanisms of this Directive have not been changed. The ultimate aim is the elimination of certain hazardous substances from electrical and electronic equipment; where this is temporarily not possible, exemptions are granted. No new substances are proposed to be banned. The main proposed modifications are as follows: Harmonisation of the scope : two new annexes describing the Directive’s scope are added, the first describing the broad product categories and the second, amendable by the Commission, providing binding product lists within each category. Medical devices and control and monitoring instruments are included to reap the environmental and health benefits from the reduction of use of hazardous substances in such equipment, but in a gradual manner so that adverse socioeconomic impacts are avoided. Definitions : the definitions for economic operators are aligned to the ""Marketing of products"" package and new definitions, such as for ""medical devices"" and ""homogeneous material"" are added. Harmonised definitions, coherent with related Community legislation, enhance legal clarity and reduce administrative cost. Substance ban : maximum concentration values for the banned substances are set (incorporation in the Directive of a Commission Decision) and permission to use non-compliant spare parts is extended to equipment benefiting from an exemption when placed on the market, to prevent premature withdrawal of equipment from use. A new annex with exemptions specific to the new product categories (medical devices and control and monitoring instruments) is added for cases where substitution is currently not feasible. A mechanism for introducing new substance bans in line with the REACH methodology is inserted to ensure coherence and maximise synergy with the work carried out under the chemicals' legislation. Detailed rules of this process will be developed through comitology. When developing these detailed rules, the Commission will give priority to using the expertise available at the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The Commission will invite ECHA to evaluate the substances concerned as a priority. Exemptions mechanism : a 4-year maximum validity period for the exemptions is set to stimulate substitution efforts, provide legal security and shift the burden of proof to the applicant, in line with REACH. New criteria such as availability and reliability for granting exemptions are introduced to take into account broader socio-economic aspects. A mandate is given to the Commission for establishing detailed rules for the applicants to apply when requesting an exemption for facilitating them and speeding up the scrutiny process. Evaluation of product conformity and market surveillance mechanisms : new provisions introduce product conformity assessment requirements and market surveillance mechanisms in line with the ""Marketing of products"" package. Reducing the number of non-compliant products through strengthened and harmonised market surveillance is a cost effective way of increasing the environmental benefit of the Directive. Harmonised conformity assessment requirements increase legal certainty and reduce the administrative cost for Member States and manufacturers."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 8 July 2019, the Council adopted the mandate authorising the European Commission to open negotiations for the renewal of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement, which expires on 15 November 2019. On 8 November 2019, the Protocol was extended for a period of one year by an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters, until 15 November 2020 by means of Council Decision (EU) 2020/742. Due to the current health context (COVID -19 pandemic) the ongoing negotiations for the renewal of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol will not be concluded in time to avoid a disruption of fishing activities at the end of this extension. In this context, on 26 June 20203 the Council therefore authorised the Commission to negotiate a further extension to the Protocol for a maximum duration of one more year. CONTENT: in order to prevent an interruption of fishing activity for the European fleet operating in Mauritanian waters, the Council Decision endorsing this agreement in the form of an exchange of letters must be adopted in due time to allow for signature by both Parties before 15 November 2020, when the current Protocol expires. The aim of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters is to enable the European Union and Mauritania to continue working together to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and a sound exploitation of fishery resources in Mauritanian waters and to allow EU vessels to fish in those waters. Fishing opportunities The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 25 vessels; -Black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers targeting black hake: 3 500 tonnes of hake, 1 450 tonnes of squid, 600 tonnes of cuttlefish for 6 vessels; - Vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Tuna seiners: 12 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 25 vessels; - Pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners: 7 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers: 225 000 tonnes and 19 vessels; - Non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from volume under category 6 if used) and 2 vessels. Financial contribution The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 61 625 000, based on: (a) an annual amount for access to fishery resources for the categories provided for in the Protocol, set at EUR 57 500 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol; (b) support for the development of Mauritania’s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 4 125 000 per year for the duration of the extension to the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of Mauritania’s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure. The exchange of letters regarding the extension also sets out a pro rata reduction in case the negotiations for the renewal of the Partnership Agreement and its Protocol result in their signature, leading to their application, before the annual extension covered by the exchange of letters expires."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Tripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment (TSS) was set up by Council Decision 2003/174/EC, which formalised the practice of holding highlevel, informal meetings since 1997 in the framework of the European Employment Strategy, and subsequently the Lisbon Strategy. This Decision was proposed to institutionalise the practice of high-level consultation between the EU institutions and the EU social partners. The proposal meant abolishing the former Standing Committee on Employment, which was set up in 1970 and reformed in 1999. Since 2003, the TSS has been a separate event from the European Council meetings and has broadly fulfilled its aim of facilitating the exchange of views at the highest level between the Commission, the EU Presidency and the EU social partners on employment and social aspects of the Lisbon Strategy (since 2010, and then of the Europe 2020 Strategy). Until the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the meetings were co-chaired by the Council Presidency and the President of the Commission. The 2003 Decision also gave a role to the two subsequent Presidencies. In its Communication of 2 October 2013 on the social dimension of the EMU, the Commission announced that it will present a proposal to revise the 2003 Council Decision. This is the aim of this proposal. The amendment of the 2003 Council Decision is also needed as a result of the institutional changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon. In addition, the overall policy framework needs to be revised, replacing the Lisbon Strategy with the Europe 2020 Strategy and specifying how the TSS for Growth and Employment contributes to the overall governance. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to revise the 2003 Council Decision. The main provisions may be summarised as follows: Task: its tasks shall be to: Membership: the main amendments concern the membership of the TSS. The Summit shall consist of the: President of the European Council, The ministers from those three presidencies and the Commissioner responsible for employment and social affairs shall also be present. The social partners’ representatives shall be divided into two delegations of equal size comprising 10 workers’ representatives and 10 employers’ representatives, taking into account the need to ensure a balanced participation between men and women. Each delegation shall consist of representatives of European cross-industry organisations, either representing general interests or more specific interests of supervisory and managerial staff and small and medium-sized businesses at European level. Technical coordination shall be provided for the workers’ delegation by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and for the employers’ delegation by the Confederation of European Business (BUSINESSEUROPE). Technical provisions are set out as regards: Presidency and organisation: the Summit shall be chaired jointly by the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission. The meetings of the Summit shall be convened by the joint chairmen on their own initiative, in consultation with the social partners."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is ensured. Currently citizens face different practical problems with asset planning when they are in an international marriage or partnership. The problem is that it is very difficult for people to know which courts have jurisdiction and which laws are applicable to their personal situation and the situation of their property. As a result, they face unintended, and disadvantageous, consequences not only in the daily management of their assets but also when the couple separates or a member of the couple dies. On 16 March 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of matrimonial property regimes and a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions regarding the property consequences of registered partnerships. The European Parliament delivered its favourable opinion and comments on the two proposals on 10 September 2013. However, the Council concluded at its meeting of 3 December 2015 that it would not be possible to reach an EU-wide agreement in relation to both regulations within a reasonable period of time. To date, the Commission has received requests from 17 Member States indicating their wish to establish enhanced cooperation: Sweden, Belgium, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, Malta, Luxembourg, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria and Finland. The Commission concluded that all the legal conditions set by the Treaties for the authorisation of the establishment of enhanced cooperation are fulfilled. It considered that the benefits of establishing enhanced cooperation are numerous compared to the option of keeping the status quo and that the advantages of establishing enhanced cooperation in this area outweigh any possible disadvantage. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision – based on Article 329(1), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) – seeks to authorise enhanced cooperation between 17 requesting Member States in the area of jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the property regimes of international couples, covering both matters of matrimonial property regimes and the property consequences of registered partnerships. Proposals for specific measures implementing the enhanced cooperation are submitted together with this proposal. According to the Commission, enhanced cooperation would bring citizens the following benefits: Enhanced cooperation shall be open at any time to all Member States, in accordance with Article 328 of the TFEU."
6020EP7,"""""Manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products""""",0.105,0.722,0.912,0.387,0.303,0.711,0.805,0.6,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to revise Directive 2001/37/EC on tobacco products in order to improve the functioning of the internal market and ensure a high level of health protection. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: tobacco is the most significant cause of premature death in the EU, responsible for almost 700 000 deaths every year. More than ten years have passed since the adoption of the Directive 2001/37/EC on tobacco products. In line with market, scientific and international developments, it has become necessary to update and complement this Directive. The overall objective of the revision is to improve the functioning of the internal market. In particular, the proposal aims to: · update already harmonised areas, in order to overcome obstacles encountered by Member States in bringing their national legislation in line with new market, scientific and international developments; · address product related measures not yet covered by the Directive; · ensure that provisions of the Directive are not circumvented by the placing on the market of products not compliant with the Directive; · ensure a harmonised implementation of international obligations following from the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which is binding for the EU and all Member States. With regard to health protection, the proposed revision: · seeks to regulate tobacco products in a way that reflects their specific characteristics (nicotine has addictive properties) and the negative consequences of their consumption (mouth, throat and lung cancer, cardiovascular problems including heart attacks, strokes, clogged arteries, increased risk of blindness, impotence, lower fertility, impact on the unborn child etc); · focuses on initiation of tobacco consumption, in particular by young people, taking into account that 70% of the smokers start before the age of 18 and 94% before the age of 25; · create conditions which allow all citizens across the EU to take informed decisions about the products, based on accurate information on the health consequences of consuming tobacco products. The Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a Health for Growth Programme contains measures which have as their direct objective the protection of public health regarding tobacco products and advertisement required by or contributing to the objectives of EU legislation in this field. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission undertook an impact assessment which accompanies the proposal. A high level of health protection has been taken as the basic criteria amongst the different strategic options that were considered during the review of the Directive. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT : the revision of Directive 2001/37/CE focuses on the following areas: 1) Ingredients and emissions : the maximum yields of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide as well as the measurement methods remain the same as in Directive 2001/37/EC. · keeps in place the mandatory reporting system of ingredients and, in addition, provides that a common electronic format for the reporting and manufacturers are required to provide supporting data (e.g. marketing reports); · provides that placing on the market of new or modified tobacco products must not take place before the submission of ingredients data. Reported data, excluding confidential information, must be published; · prohibits tobacco products with characterising flavours, such as fruit flavours or chocolate, and prohibits flavourings in filters, papers or packages; · forbids additives associated with energy and vitality (e.g. caffeine and taurine), or creating the impression that products have health benefits (e.g. vitamins); · exempts tobacco products other than cigarettes, roll-your own tobacco and smokeless tobacco products, i.e. cigars, cigarillos and pipe tobacco from some provisions such as the prohibition of products with characterising flavours. The exemption shall be removed if there is a substantial change of circumstances (in terms of sales volume or prevalence level among young people). 2) Labelling and packaging : the proposal seeks to ensure that the appearance of the package reflects the characteristics of the product inside the package - a product that has negative health consequences, is addictive, and is not for the consumption of children and teenagers. In concrete terms, the proposal: · provides that that combined warnings (picture plus text) of 75% should be displayed on both sides of the packages of tobacco products, presented in rotation; · replaces tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (TNCO) levels on the packages with an information message referring to harmful substances of tobacco; · ensures that display of cessation information (e.g. quit-lines, websites) is added to the packages; · states that neither packaging of tobacco products, nor the products themselves, shall include any elements that promote tobacco products or mislead consumers into believing that the product is less harmful than others, refers to flavours or tastes or resembles a food product; · exempts tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your own tobacco from larger health warnings; · provides that in order to increase the visibility of the health warnings on smokeless tobacco products, these will have to be put on both sides of the package according to the proposal, but their size will remain unchanged compared to Directive 2001/37. 3) Traceability and security features : the proposal: · provides for an EU tracking and tracing system at packet level for tobacco products throughout the supply chain (excluding retail). Tobacco products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own-tobacco are granted a transitional period of five years; · provides that technical standards to ensure compatibility between the tracking and tracing systems used as well as for the contracts with third parties shall be adopted by delegated acts. Technical standardisations for security features shall also be adopted through delegated acts. 4) Tobacco for oral use : the ban of placing on the market (including cross-border distance sale) of tobacco for oral use as set out in Directive 2001/37/EC is maintained (except for Sweden which has an exemption in its Accession Treaty). 5) Cross-border distance sales of tobacco products : cross-border distance sales of tobacco products fall outside the scope of Directive 2001/37/EC. The proposal: · includes a notification obligation for retailers of tobacco products intending to engage in cross-border distance sales; · allows Member States to require the retailer to appoint a natural person, who ensures compliance with the Directive of products delivered to customers in the Member States concerned; · provides a mandatory age verification mechanism. 6) Novel tobacco products (do not fall within any of the established product categories): these products will have to respect requirements of the Directive (e.g. in terms of labelling and ingredients) to ensure a level playing field, and the applicable rules will depend on whether the product involves a combustion process or not. The proposal also provides a notification obligation for novel tobacco products and the Commission will issue a report on market development in these products five years after the transposition deadline of the Directive. 7) Nicotine containing products (NCP): bearing in mind the novelty and the rapid growth of the market in NCP, the proposal removes current legislative divergence between Member States and the differential treatment between Nicotine Replacement Therapies and Nicotine Containing Products. The proposal provides that: · NCP that either have a nicotine level exceeding 2 mg, a nicotine concentration exceeding 4 mg per ml or whose intended use results in a mean maximum peak plasma concentration exceeding 4 ng per ml may be placed on the market only if they have been authorised as medicinal products on the basis of their quality, safety and efficacy, and with a positive risk/benefit balance; · NCP with nicotine levels below this threshold can be sold as consumer products provided they feature an adapted health warning. 8) Herbal products for smoking : herbal products for smoking fall outside the scope of Directive 2001/37/EC and Member States regulate these products in different ways. The proposal provides for adapted health warnings for herbal products for smoking to inform consumers about the adverse health effects of these products. In addition, no promotional or misleading elements are allowed on the packages. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the estimated impact on expenditure (operational appropriations, human resources and other administrative expenditure) amounts to EUR 7,888 millions for the period 2014-2018. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC prohibits the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators, including those incorporated into appliances, that contain more than 0.002% of cadmium by weight therein. However, the portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools have been exempt from that ban. The Commission has reviewed that exemption with a view to the prohibition of cadmium in batteries and accumulators. That review led to the conclusion that, in order to gradually diminish the amount of cadmium released to the environment, the prohibition of the use of cadmium should be extended to portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools as suitable cadmium-free substitutes for these applications are available on the market, namely nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion battery technologies IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission's impact assessment concludes that compared to the baseline scenario the other policy options related to a withdrawal of the exemption (immediate withdrawal or withdrawal in 2016) would lead to a lower overall environmental impact, both in terms of avoiding releases of cadmium to the environment and in terms of aggregated environmental impacts based on six environmental indicators. The impact assessment concludes that if the exemption is withdrawn in 2016, the environmental benefits would be slightly lower than in the case of immediate withdrawal but the costs would be much lower compared to an immediate withdrawal. Over the period 2013-2025, a cordless power tools with alternative battery chemistry will, depending on the alternative battery chemistry chosen (nickel metal hydride or lithium-ion), cost EUR 0.8 and EUR 2.1 more respectively if the exemption is immediately withdrawn and an additional EUR 0.4 and EUR 0.9 respectively in the case of withdrawal in 2016. As withdrawal of the exemption in 2016 would have almost the same level of effectiveness at a higher efficiency compared to an immediate withdrawal, this option is the preferred one. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 2006/66/EC by limiting the exemption for the use of cadmium in portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools to 1 January 2016. This means that as from this date, the use of cadmium in portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools, included those incorporated into appliances, is restricted to 0.002% of cadmium by weight in line with Directive 2006/66/EC. The proposal identifies the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Directive 2006/66/EC and establishes the corresponding procedures for adoption of these acts in accordance with Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. |DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 19 January 2009, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a trade agreement on behalf of the Union with those Member Countries of the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) which shared the aim to reach a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement. On 26 June 2012, the EU signed a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. The Trade Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 March 2013 for Peru and 1 August 2013 for Colombia. On 17 July 2014, the Union and Ecuador concluded their negotiations on the Protocol to take account of the Accession of Ecuador to the Trade Agreement. The text of the Protocol was approved by the Trade Committee of the Trade Agreement at its meeting of 8 February 2016. CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Protocol of Accession to the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Colombia and Peru on the other part, to take account of the Accession of Ecuador. The Protocol in question establishes the necessary modifications to the Trade Agreement to take account of the accession of Ecuador. The Trade Agreement establishes the conditions for EU economic operators to take full advantage of the opportunities and the emerging complementarities between our respective economies: According to the Commission, the accession of Ecuador to the existing Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru, which is a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement, reinforces the legal framework of the EU trade relations with this country and facilitates reciprocal trade and investment. Moreover, accession to the Trade Agreement will provide an anchor for Ecuador's economic reforms and efforts to integrate the global economy and increase welfare. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: foregone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 80 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council adopts the act after consulting the European Parliament but without being obliged to follow its opinion. BACKGROUND: on 26 March 2010, the European Council agreed to the European Commission's proposal to launch a new strategy for jobs and growth, Europe 2020, based on enhanced coordination of economic policies, which will focus on the key areas where action is needed to boost Europe’s potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness. To that end, the European Council agreed to set EU headline targets, which constitute shared objectives guiding action of the Member States and of the Union. The Treaty on the functioning of the EU provides that Member States are to regard their economic policies and promoting employment as matters of common concern and coordinate them within the Council. In two distinct articles, it provides that the Council is to adopt broad economic policy guidelines (Article 121) and employment guidelines (Article 148), specifying that the latter must be consistent with the former. Given this legal basis, the guidelines for employment and economic policies are presented as two distinct — but intrinsically interconnected — legal instruments: A Council Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union -Part I of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines; A Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States –Part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines. These guidelines implemented by the above mentioned legal instruments form together the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. The employment guidelines were adopted on 21 October 2010, and as provided by the adoption decision should remain stable until 2014 to ensure a focus on implementation. The overall objectives and priorities expressed in the guidelines for the employment policies remain valid. Consequently, with this proposal, the Commission maintains the guidelines adopted in 2010. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission proposes that the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States set out in the Annex to Council Decision of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States are maintained for 2014 as they were in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The employment guidelines shall be taken into account by the Member States in their employment policies."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Council and the European Parliament adopted in 2006 a Regulation laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States (""Local Border Traffic Regulation"") which allows derogating, for persons living in a border area, from the general rules on border checks set out in the Schengen Borders Code. The Regulation authorises Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with neighbouring non-EU countries, provided these agreements fully comply with the parameters set by the Regulation. In February 2011, the Commission concluded in a report that the local border traffic regime makes life significantly easier for people living near the external land borders, while at the same time there is little evidence that the regime is being abused. It also stated that given the specific position of Kaliningrad (the Kaliningrad region of Russia with a population of almost one million inhabitants became the only enclave within the EU as a consequence of the 2004 EU enlargement) an amendment of the Local Border Traffic Regulation may be justified. In order to avoid Kaliningrad's isolation from its immediate neighbours, there is a need to facilitate travel for its inhabitants. For the Regulation to have real effect in that region, a specific border area on the Polish side should be included in the eligible border area as well, in order to facilitate and enhance economic and cultural interchange between the Kaliningrad oblast on the one hand and major centres in the North of Poland on the other. This proposal will contribute to further promoting the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, in line with the priorities set out in the Roadmap of the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice regarding cross-border cooperation and shall be considered in the context of the overall EU- Russia relationship. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 77 (2) (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

3384EP8,"""""Markets in financial instruments, market abuse and securities settlement""""",0.786,0.896,0.0,0.188,0.154,0.955,0.89,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to extend the date of entry into application of both instruments that are comprised in MIFID II on markets in financial instruments. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU (‘MiFID’) together with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (‘MiFIR’) was adopted in the wake of the financial crisis. MiFID and MiFIR, collectively referred to as MiFID II, covers securities markets, investment intermediaries and trading venues. The new framework reinforces and replaces the current MiFID framework (Directive 2004/39/EC). Member States need to transpose the Directive by 3 July 2016. Both MiFID and MiFIR are scheduled to apply as of 3 January 2017. During the legislative process, the very high level of complexity of the MiFID II package and the need for a significant number of implementing measures were recognised. To this end, a period of 30 months was foreseen between the adoption and the entry into application, instead of the usual 18-24 months. Despite this unusually long period, ESMA has made clear to the Commission that the technical implementing challenges are of such magnitude that essential data infrastructures will not be in place in time for 3 January 2017. This is a result of significant challenges in collecting the data that is necessary for the operation of the MiFID II rules. The absence of data has ramifications across multiple areas of MIFID II. As regards market regulation, it is clear that without the foundation of reference data (instrument ID) and the additional data infrastructures for transparency calculations and position reporting in place, it will not be possible to apply the majority of the market rules. In order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption, urgent action is therefore needed to adjust the date of entry into application for MiFID II Changing the date of applicability of MiFID II does however have consequences for the applicability of other legislation, in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014 ('MAR' – market abuse) and Regulation (EU) 909/2014 ('CSDR' - central securities depositories regulation). CONTENT: the purpose of the draft proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 on markets in financial instruments is to extend the entry into application of both instruments that are comprised in the MIFID II package as a result of the technical implementation challenges met by the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), national competent authorities ('NCAs') and stakeholders. In order to enable ESMA, NCAs and stakeholders to complete the operational implementation, the Commission considered it appropriate to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 by 12 months until 3 January 2018. Reports and reviews should be deferred accordingly. The Commission stated that an extension of one year should provide sufficient and reasonable time for ESMA, NCAs and operators to put in place the infrastructure for data collection, reporting and the transparency threshold calculations. In order to ensure that references in Regulation (EU) 596/2014 to organised trading facilities, small and medium-sized enterprises’ ('SME') growth markets, emission allowances or auctioned products based thereon do not apply until the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU, Article 39(4) of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 stating that references to them are read as references to Directive 2004/39/EC should be adjusted taking into account the extension of the date of application of those acts. In order to ensure that Directive 2004/39/EC is referenced in Regulation (EU) 909/2014 until the extended date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU and that the transitional provisions for MTFs applying for registration as SME growth markets under Regulation (EU) 909/2014 are maintained so as to provide sufficient time for MTFs to apply for such registration under Directive 2014/65/EU, it is proposed that Regulation (EU) 909/2014 should be amended."
5316EP7,"""""Civil protection mechanism""""",0.053,0.919,0.912,0.548,0.394,0.904,0.928,0.457,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to provide for a new Civil Protection Mechanism for the Union for the period 2014-2020. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal seeks to replace the Council Decisions on the Civil Protection Mechanism, which facilitates reinforced cooperation between the Member States and the Union in the field of civil protection and the Civil Protection Financial Instrument, which provides funding for the actions under the Mechanism to ensure protection against natural and man-made disasters. After a comprehensive evaluation of the Civil Protection legislation for the period 2007-2009 and taking account of lessons learnt from past emergencies, this proposal merges the two Council Decisions into a single legal act. The proposal builds on the 2010 Commission Communication 'Towards a stronger European disaster response: the role of civil protection and humanitarian assistance' and the 2009 Communication on 'A Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters' which were welcomed by Parliament (see INI/2011/2023 and INI/2009/2151). The proposal contributes to Europe's 2020 objectives and to increasing the security of EU citizens and building resilience to natural and man-made disasters. Furthermore, by supporting and promoting measures to prevent disasters, an EU Civil Protection policy would reduce the costs to the EU economy from disasters and therefore obstacles to growth. The proposal also makes a significant contribution to simplification. The new decision merges into a single text the provisions relating to the functioning of the Mechanism and those relating to the financing of its activities, that in the past were in separate decisions. It also simplifies the existing procedures for the pooling and co-financing of the transport of assistance (e.g. by avoiding a systematic reimbursement of 50%, as is the case under the current rules, and by appointing a lead state in transport operations involving several Member States), thereby significantly reducing the administrative burden on the Commission and Member States. It also establishes simplified rules for the activation of the Mechanism in emergencies in third countries. The strengthened Mechanism will contribute to the implementation of the Solidarity Clause, on which the European Commission and the High Representative will bring forward a proposal in 2012. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main problems identified in the impact assessment are: i) the reactive and ad hoc mechanics of the EU Civil protection cooperation limit the effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of European disaster response, ii) unavailability of critical response capacities (capacity gaps), iii) limited transport solutions and heavy procedures hinder optimal response, iv) limited preparedness in training and exercises, and v) lack of integration of prevention policies. Following the impact assessment, it was proposed to include the following aspects in the legislative proposal: on response : the inclusion of essential elements and principles on the voluntary pool of assets and on EU-funded assets with a reference to the implementation rules; on transport: a revision of some of the current legal provisions to increase the maximum EU financing rate for transport operations, and simplify administrative procedures; on prevention and preparedness : a general EU policy framework and Commission guidelines, with provision for Member States’ risk management plans (RMPs). LEGAL BASIS: Article 196 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal provides for the creation of a new civil protection mechanism for the Union to support, coordinate and supplement the actions of the Member States in the field of civil protection in improving the effectiveness of systems for preventing, preparing for and responding to natural and man-made disasters of all kinds within and outside the Union. The idea is to provide for an integrated approach to disaster management. The proposal provides for a general objective which is subdivided into specific objectives, accompanied by indicators to measure the progress made. Specific objectives : to achieve a high level of protection against disasters by preventing or reducing their effects and by fostering a culture of prevention; to enhance the Union's state of preparedness to respond to disasters; and to facilitate rapid and efficient emergency response interventions in the event of major disasters. Proposed measures : 1) Prevention : the purpose is to enhance the importance of the EU prevention policy framework and effectively linking it to the preparedness and response actions. The proposal sets out the tasks for the Commission in this context which, in particular, include: i) improving the knowledge base on disaster risks and facilitating the sharing of knowledge, best practices and information; ii) supporting and promoting Members States' risk assessment and mapping; iii) an inventory of natural and man-made risks the Union may face taking into account the future impact of climate change; and iv) raising awareness about the importance of risk prevention and supporting Member States in public information, education and awareness-raising, etc. Building on the ongoing work on risk assessments and to ensure effective cooperation within the Mechanism, Member States are required to communicate, with the help and support of the Commission, their risk management plans by end 2016. 2) Preparation : The main focus of the proposal is on preparedness actions to improve the response planning, to enhance EU response capacity and the overall level of preparedness for large-scale disasters. In comparison with the previous mechanism the main changes include: establishing and managing of a Emergency Response Centre ('ERC') on the basis of the existing Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), which should be strengthened to ensure 24/7 operational capacity; developing a coherent planning framework for response operations by preparing reference scenarios, mapping existing capacities and developing contingency plans for their deployment. Synergies between in-kind assistance and humanitarian aid are also sought; establishing a European Emergency Response Capacity in the form of a voluntary pool of pre-identified capacities, which Member States make available for operations under the Mechanism. The need for increased visibility of the capacities is also highlighted; identification and filling gaps in the response capacities by supporting the development of complementary EU-funded capacities, where this has been considered more cost-efficient than Member States' individual investments. A special monitoring procedure is envisaged and the Commission is obliged to report every two years to the Council and the Parliament on the progress; enlarging the scope of the current EU preparedness actions in the field of training, including through the establishment of a training network and diversification of the training programme. The Commission can also provide guidance on EU and international civil protection training; sending expert teams to advise on prevention and preparedness measures at the request of an affected state or the UN and its agencies; providing the possibility to assist Member States in pre-positioning emergency response capacities in logistical hubs inside the EU. 3) Response : the proposed changes seek to ensure more effective and swifter response through: temporary pre-positioning of capacities in situations of increased risk; proposal of an emergency response plan and request for deployment of the capacities; requiring Member States to ensure host nation support for the incoming assistance, as called for in the Council Conclusions on Host Nation support. 4) Other specific measures : to enable the implementation of the mechanism, the Commission shall be authorised to finance preparation, follow-up, monitoring, audit and evaluation actions that are necessary for the management of the programme and the achievement of its objectives. External dimension of civil protection operations : in operations outside the Union, the proposal promotes consistency in the international civil protection work through: providing assistance through the Mechanism at the request of the United Nations or its agencies, or a relevant international organisation; the Commission informing the European External Action Service to allow for consistency between civil protection operation and the overall EU relations with the affected country; clarifying the cases when consular support assistance can be provided, taking into account a forthcoming proposal for a Council Directive on coordination and cooperation measures regarding consular protection for unrepresented EU citizens. The countries concerned would be the following: European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA); acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates; countries coming under the European Neighbourhood Policy as well as potential candidate countries not participating in the Mechanism; and international or regional organisations where relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements between these organisations and the Union so allow. Financial support provisions : eligible actions fall within the following 4 fields: general actions, prevention and preparedness, response, and transport. The provisions relating to the support for transport under the current Instrument are amended and simplified and introduce revised conditions for financing increasing the co-financing rates up to 85% of the total eligible cost and up to 100% in limited cases when certain criteria are met. New provisions allow one Member State to take the lead in requesting EU financial support for operations, which involve several Member States and allowing an affected Member State requesting assistance to request also co-financing of transport costs. Changes are also introduced to the types of financial intervention to allow for the reimbursement of expenses and the establishment of trust funds. In the case of grants and public procurement, it will not be necessary to include emergency response related operations in the annual work programme of the Commission. Lastly, the proposal contains the classic provisions with regard to the protection of the financial interests of the Union against fraud and other irregularities, implementation, evaluation and transitional measures until the entry into force of this decision. Repeal : when the decision enters into force, the existing mechanisms will be repealed. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Commission's Communication on 'A Budget for Europe 2020' envisages budgetary commitments for the EU civil protection policy of EUR 513 million in current prices, as follows: EUR 276 million inside the Union and EUR 237 million for operations outside the Union."

BACKGROUND: Council Directive 2004/67/EC established a legal framework at Community level to safeguard security of natural gas supply and to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal gas market in the case of supply disruptions. However, under the current measures, Member States still enjoy a large margin of discretion as to the choice of measures. Where the security of supply of a Member State is threatened, there is a clear risk that measures developed unilaterally by that Member State may jeopardise the proper functioning of the internal gas market. Recent experience has demonstrated the reality of that risk. To allow the internal gas market to function even in the face of a shortage of supply, it is therefore necessary to provide for a more coordinated response to supply crises, both concerning preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of supply. In response to the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis in January 2009 causing an unprecedented disruption of gas supplies to the Community via Ukraine, the European Council and the European Parliament have called for an accelerated revision of the existing Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment has considered five policy options: 1) no new Community action; 2) better enforcement of Directive 2004/67/EC; 3) voluntary approach by industry; 4) a revised directive; 5) a new regulation. With regard to options 1 and 2, the Commission concluded that the existing Directive is insufficient given the growing import dependence and increased supply and transit risks in third countries as well as, increasing gas flows and the development of the internal gas market within the Community. With regard to option 3, a major disadvantage of a voluntary approach is that participation of all players in a consistent manner cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the extra capacity to ensure security of supply is not necessarily provided by market forces. With regard to options 4 and 5 (choice of legal instrument) the Commission considers that a Regulation is a more appropriate instrument than a Directive for the following main reasons: (i) a Regulation is directly applicable to the competent authorities in the Member States, to natural gas undertakings and to customers; (ii) it does not require lengthy transposition; it ensures clarity and coherence of standards and obligations across the Community and it defines directly the involvement of Community institutions. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation on security of gas supply would provide a common indicator to define a serious gas supply disruption. This is known as N-1, i.e. the shutdown of a major supply infrastructure or equivalent (e.g. import pipeline or production facility). It would require all Member States to have a competent authority that would be responsible for monitoring gas supply developments, assessing risks to supplies, establishing preventive action plans and setting up emergency plans. It would also oblige Member States to collaborate closely in a crisis, including through a strengthened Gas Coordination Group and through shared access to reliable supply information and data. The main objective of the proposal is to increase the security of gas supply by creating the incentives to invest in necessary interconnections to meet the N-1 indicator, as well as the reverse flows. The Regulation places primary emphasis on the role of the internal gas market to ensure the security of gas supply. It states that security of gas supply is a task of the natural gas undertakings, Competent Authorities of the Member States, the industrial gas customers, and the Commission within their respective areas of responsibility. It requires a high degree of cooperation between them. The Regulation allows the recourse to non-market based measures decided by the competent authority only as the last resort in emergency situations when all market based measures are exhausted and the natural gas undertakings are no longer able to deal with a supply disruption. The Commission is also given a stronger role to ensure that the internal market works for as long as possible and that measures decided at national level are compatible with this principle. The proposed Regulation would improve the framework for investment in new cross-border interconnections, new import corridors, reverse flows capacities and storages, supported also by the European Economic Recovery Plan. It confirms the greater interdependence of gas supplies within a single European gas market, and provides a sound basis for the EU to defend its interests more effectively in its relations with external gas suppliers. Those interconnections are at the same time necessary for the proper functioning of the internal gas market. The following points should be noted: solidarity measures : security of gas supply is a task of the natural gas undertakings, Competent Authorities of the Member States, the industrial gas customers, and the Commission within their respective areas of responsibility. It requires a high degree of cooperation between them in order to effectively manage any eventual major gas supply disruption; establishment of Preventive Action Plan and Emergency Plan : by 31 March 2011 at the latest, the Competent Authority shall establish: (a) a Preventive Action Plan containing the measures needed to mitigate the risks identified; and (b) an Emergency Plan containing the measures to be taken to mitigate the impact of a gas supply disruption; infrastructure standard : by 31 March 2014, the Competent Authority shall ensure that in the event of a disruption of the largest gas supply infrastructure, the remaining infrastructure (N-1) has the capacity to deliver the necessary volume of gas to satisfy total gas demand of the calculated area during a period of sixty days of exceptionally high gas demand during the coldest period statistically occurring every 20 years; Community emergency responses : the Commission may declare a Community Emergency at the request of one Competent Authority or when the Community loses more than 10% of its daily gas import from third countries as calculated by ENTSO-G. It shall declare a Community Emergency where more than one Competent Authority has declared Emergency. The Commission shall convene the Gas Coordination Group as soon as it declares Community Emergency. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will have a limited impact on the Community budget, covering the costs of meetings of the Gas Coordination Group and the costs of the monitoring task force which can be deployed to monitor the gas flows within and outside the Community. Missions outside the Community in moments of crisis may draw on funds from the Instrument for Stability."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a new regulatory framework to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medical devices. At the same time, it sets high standards of quality and safety for medical devices in order to meet common safety concerns as regards such devices. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 significantly reinforces key elements of the existing regulatory approach in Council Directive 90/385/EEC and Council Directive 93/42/EEC, such as the supervision of notified bodies, conformity assessment procedures, clinical investigations and clinical evaluation, vigilance and market surveillance, whilst introducing provisions ensuring transparency and traceability regarding medical devices, to improve health and safety. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting public health crisis represent an unprecedented challenge for Member States and a heavy burden for national authorities, health care institutions and economic operators. The coronavirus crisis has created exceptional circumstances that require considerable additional resources and increased availability of vitally important medical devices such as medical gloves, surgical masks or intensive care equipment. None of these measures could reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation. These extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore very likely that Member States, health care institutions, economic operators and other stakeholders would not have been able to ensure its proper implementation and application from the date of application initially foreseen on 26 May 2020. CONTENT: for exceptional reasons, in the current context of the coronavirus epidemic, the Commission proposes to defer by one year, to 26 May 2021, the date of application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 which should have applied from 26 May 2020. The proposed amendment aims to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, namely the establishment of a rigorous, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for medical devices that ensures a high level of protection of public health and patient safety and the proper functioning of the internal market for these devices. At the same time, it is proposed to defer the date of repeal of Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices and Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices by one year. These postponements would ensure that an operational regulatory framework for medical devices would be in place from 26 May 2020. In addition, the proposed amendment aims to ensure that, in exceptional cases, the Commission may adopt, as soon as possible, EU-wide derogations following national derogations, in order to effectively address potential shortages of vitally important medical devices in the EU. In view of the urgent need to respond immediately to the public health crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed amending Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."
827EP7,"""""Capital requirements for the trading book and for re-securitisations, and the supervisory review of remuneration policies""""",0.684,0.905,0.842,0.548,0.545,0.916,0.913,0.057,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC as regards capital requirements for the trading book and for re-securitisations, and the supervisory review of remuneration policies PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a new capital requirements framework, based on the 'Basel-II' revised international capital framework, was adopted in June 2006 as the Capital Requirements Directive ('CRD'): this comprises Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (recast) and Directive 2006/49/EC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (recast). There is widespread recognition that further regulatory reform is needed to address weaknesses in the regulatory capital framework and in the risk management of financial institutions that contributed to the turmoil in global financial markets. As part of its response to the financial crisis, in November 2008 the Commission mandated a High Level Group chaired by Mr. Jacques de Larosière to propose recommendations for reforming the European financial supervision and regulation. Building on the Group's recommendations, in its Communication ""Driving European Recovery"" for the spring European Council of March 4, 2009  the Commission set out an ambitious programme of financial services reform. The present proposal is one of the several measures that the Commission has already taken to implement that programme. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: altogether, fourteen different policy options have been assessed. The preferred option is as follows: Trading Book : with respect to capital requirements for bank trading books, the following targeted amendments, aligned with what is envisaged by the Basel Committee, will be introduced. Re-securitizations : in line with the approach developed by the Basel Committee, re-securitization positions would be assigned a higher capital requirement than other securitisation positions to reflect the higher risk of unexpected impairment losses. For particularly complex re-securitizations, the proposals reinforce both the due diligence requirements and the supervisory process to enforce them. Disclosure requirements : these changes will improve investor understanding of banks' risk profile and, by enhancing transparency, reinforce banks' risk management. The incremental administrative burden for the EU banking industry is estimated at EUR 1.3 million per year and is expected to fall mostly on larger institutions with more advanced approaches to risk management. Supervisory Review of Remuneration Policies : the proposed amendments will impose oblige credit institutions and investment firms to have remuneration policies that are consistent with effective risk management. The relevant principles will be set out in the CRD, but will be closely aligned with those set out in Commission Recommendation on remuneration policies in the financial services sector. Making the relevant principles of the Recommendation binding will increase the rate of compliance by credit institutions and investment firms. CONTENT: the Commission is proposing a further revision of EU rules on capital requirements for banks that is designed to tighten up the way in which banks assess the risks connected with their trading book; impose higher capital requirements for re-securitisations; increase market confidence through stronger disclosure requirements for securitisation exposures; and require banks to have sound remuneration practices that do not encourage or reward excessive risk-taking. Under the new rules, banks will be restricted in their investments in highly complex re-securitisations if they cannot demonstrate that they have fully understood the risks involved, while national supervisory authorities will review banks' remuneration policies and have the power to impose sanctions if the policies do not meet the new requirements. The main amendments are as follows: Capital requirements for re-securitisations: re-securitisations are complex financial products that have played a role in the development of the financial crisis. In certain circumstances, banks that hold them can be exposed to considerable losses. The proposal will impose higher capital requirements for re-securitisations, to make sure that banks take proper account of the risks of investing in such complex financial products. For particularly complex re-securitizations, the proposals reinforce both the due diligence requirements and the supervisory process to enforce them. For investments in re-securitizations of particularly high complexity, banks will have to demonstrate to their supervisor that necessary due diligence standards have been met. If they cannot do so, a general deduction from capital would apply. In instances where compliance with required due diligence is found to be inadequate, institutions would be debarred from future investment in such instruments. In exceptional cases where a bank cannot demonstrate to its regulator that it has complied with the required due diligence in respect of a highly complex re-securitisation, a risk weight of 1250% will be applied to the position in that re-securitisation. This capital treatment applies to new re-securitisations issued after 31 December 2010, and will only apply to an existing re-securitisation position after 31 December 2014 if new underlying exposures are added or substituted after that date. Accordingly, the 1250% risk weight cannot be applied to banks' legacy positions in re-securitisations (unless the underlying exposures of those positions are changed after the end of 2014). Disclosure of securitisation exposures: proper disclosure of the level of risks to which banks are exposed is necessary for market confidence. The new rules will tighten up disclosure requirements to increase the market confidence that is necessary to encourage banks to start lending to each other again. In particular, the disclosure requirements will in future cover the risks not only of securitisation positions in the non-trading book, but also those in the trading book. Capital requirements for the trading book: the trading book consists of all the financial instruments that a bank holds with the intention of re-selling them in the short term, or in order to hedge other instruments in the trading book. The proposal will change the way that banks assess the risks connected with their trading books to ensure that they fully reflect the potential losses from adverse market movements in the kind of stressed conditions that have been experienced recently. Capital requirements for securitisations in the trading book are currently calculated as if these instruments were normal debt positions. This contrasts with the banking book, where there is a separate, more differentiated and risk sensitive set of capital requirements. This proposal envisages that the trading book capital requirements be based on those for equivalent securities in the banking book. Remuneration policies and practices within banks : under the current European supervisory framework, there is no requirement that the remuneration policies of financial institutions should be subject to supervisory oversight. As a result, supervisory authorities have generally not focused on the implications of remuneration policies for risk and effective risk management. The purpose of this proposed amendment to the CRD is: to impose a binding obligation on credit institutions and investment firms to have remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management, accompanied by high level principles on sound remuneration;  to bring remuneration policies within the scope of the supervisory review under the CRD, so that supervisors would be able to require the firm to take measures to rectify any problems that they might identify;  to ensure that supervisors may also impose financial or non-financial penalties (including fines) against firms that fail to comply with the obligation.  The requirement will apply to credit institutions and to investment firms that are authorised and regulated under Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments. The scope of the obligation is restricted to remuneration for staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the bank or investment firm. This targets the remuneration policies for those individuals who take decisions that may affect the level of risk assumed by the institution. The principles on sound remuneration are not intended to prescribe the amount and form of remuneration, and institutions remain responsible for the design and application of their particular remuneration policy. Prudential oversight in the course of the supervisory review would focus on whether the remuneration policies and practices are consistent with sound risk management given the nature of the firm's business. In order to align supervisory assessments, and to assist firms in complying with the principles, the proposal requires CEBS to ensure the existence of guidelines on sound remuneration policies. If a supervisor identifies problems it may require the credit institution or investment firm to take qualitative or quantitative measures to address those problems. Those measures may include a ('qualitative') requirement for the firm to rectify the situation by changing its remuneration structure to reduce the inherent risk and – in appropriate cases – a ('quantitative') requirement for the firm to hold additional own funds against the risk. In addition, competent authorities must also have the power under the CRD to impose penalties for a breach of any requirement of the Directive (including the proposed requirement in relation to remuneration policies). This sanctioning power is separate from the power to require firms to take qualitative or quantitative measures. The amendment is intended to ensure that supervisors have both financial and non-financial sanctions at their disposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."
3662EP8,"""""European Border and Coast Guard""""",0.543,0.923,0.02,0.021,0.077,0.91,0.911,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European Border and Coast Guard and a European Border and Coast Guard Agency in order to ensure a European integrated border management of the EU’s external borders. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: during 2015, the European Union witnessed extraordinary pressures at its external borders with an estimated 1.5 million persons having crossed the borders illegally between January and November. The significant secondary movements have led several Member States to reintroduce border control at their internal borders. This has put considerable strain on the functioning and coherence of the Schengen area. Throughout the current migration crisis, it became clear that the Schengen area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected. A chain is always only as strong as its weakest link. A decisive step towards an integrated management system for external borders therefore is needed. This is only possible as a shared task among all Member States, in line with the principles of solidarity and responsibility to which all the EU’s institutions have agreed as the guiding principles addressing the migration crisis The objective of this draft Regulation is to provide for a more integrated management of the EU’s external borders, inter alia by providing the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences to prevent that deficiencies of external border management or unpredicted migratory flows undermine the proper functioning of the Schengen area. It responds to the calls of the European Parliament and the European Council to effectively manage the external borders of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposed Regulation is part of a package of measures presented by the Commission in order to better ensure the protection of the EU’s external borders. It establishes a European Border and Coast Guard and a European Border and Coast Guard Agency built from Frontex. It seeks to provide the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences in the fields of external border management and return than Frontex currently has. This proposal sets outs out the following elements reinforcing the role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as compared to that of Frontex: a monitoring and supervisory role and liaison officers : a monitoring and risk analysis centre will be established to monitor migratory flows towards and within the European Union and to carry out risk analysis and mandatory vulnerability assessments to identify and address weak spots. Liaison officers of the Agency to be deployed to Member States so that the Agency can ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through risk analysis, information exchange and Eurosur, but also through its presence on the ground. The task of the liaison officer is to foster cooperation between the Agency and the Member States and in particular, to support the collection of information required by the Agency for carrying out the vulnerability assessment and to monitor the measures taken by Member States at the external borders; evaluation of needs : supervisory role for the Agency by establishing a mandatory vulnerability assessment by the Agency to assess the capacity of Member States to face challenges at their external borders, including by means of an assessment of the equipment and resources of Member States as well as of their contingency planning. The Executive Director, on the advice of a Supervisory Board created within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will identify the measures that need to be taken by the Member State concerned and should set a time-limit within which those measures need to be taken. The decision of the Executive Director will be binding on the Member State concerned, and where the necessary measures are not taken within the set time-limit, the matter will be referred to the Management Board for a further decision. If the Member State would still fail to act, thereby risking putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, the Commission may adopt an implementing decision for direct intervention by the Agency; urgent joint action : enhanced tasks for the Agency consisting of the setting up and deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams for joint operations and rapid border interventions, the setting up of a technical equipment pool, assisting the Commission in coordinating the activities of the migration management support teams at hotspot areas, and a strengthened role in return, risk analysis, training and research; a rapid reserve pool of border guards: mandatory pooling of human resources by establishing a rapid reserve pool which will be a standing corps composed of a small percentage of the total number of border guards in the Member States on a yearly basis. The deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams from the rapid reserve pool should be immediately complemented by additional European Border and Coast Guard Teams as appropriate. The rapid reserve pool shall be a standing corps placed at the immediate disposal of the Agency and which can be deployed from each Member State within three working days from when the operational plan is agreed upon by the Executive Director and the host Member State. For that purpose, each Member State shall, on a yearly basis, make available to the Agency a number of border guards commensurate to at least 3% of the staff of Member States without land or sea external borders and 2% of the staff of Member States with land or sea external borders, and which shall amount to a minimum of 1 500 border guards, corresponding to the profiles identified by the decision of the Management Board; return office : there will be a stronger role for the Agency on return by establishing a Return Office within the Agency to allow for the deployment of European Return Intervention Teams composed of escorts, monitors and return specialists who will work to effectively return illegally staying third country nationals. A standard European travel document for return will ensure a wider acceptance of returnees by third countries. The Agency will coordinate and organise return operations and return interventions from one or more Member States, and promote their organisation on its own initiative to reinforce the return system of the Member States which are subject to particular pressure; research : further participation by the Agency in the management of research and innovation activities, including the use of advanced surveillance technology such as remotely piloted aircraft systems; deployment of an own technical equipment pool by acquiring itself or in co-ownership with a Member State and managing a pool of technical equipment provided by the Member States, based on the needs identified by the Agency and by requiring that the technical equipment pool be completed by means of transport and operating equipment purchased by Member States under the Specific Actions of the Internal Security Fund; coast guard functions : European cooperation on coast guard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coast guard functions; increased cooperation with third countries by coordinating operational cooperation between Member States and third countries in border management, including the coordination of joint operations, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents; strengthen the mandate of the Agency to process personal data by also allowing for the processing of personal data in the organisation and coordination of joint operations, pilot projects, rapid border interventions, return operations, return interventions and in the framework of the migration management support teams, as well as in the exchange of information with Member States, the European Asylum Support Office, Europol, Eurojust or other Union Agencies; guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights by setting up a complaint mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, to be built from the existing Frontex, is tasked with the management of the external borders alongside the Member States. The subsidy for Frontex, which is to be renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency, already forms part of the Union’s budget. The Agency’s budgets for 2015 and 2016 have been reinforced in 2015 in order to enable it to address the migratory crisis, in particular by tripling the financial resources for joint operations Poseidon and Triton, extending the Agency’s support to the Member States in the area of returns and giving to necessary resources to implement hotspots. The final EU subsidy for 2016 as adopted by the Budgetary Authority is EUR 238 686 000. However, for the Agency to adequately address its new tasks as foreseen in this proposal, in 2017 an amount of at least EUR 31.5 million will need to be added to the Agency’s Union budget in addition to that one for 2016."

1099EP7,"""""Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy""""",0.754,0.821,0.807,0.516,0.242,0.843,0.8,0.543,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) no 663/2009 established a programme to aid economic recovery for Europe (EEPR) by granting €3.98 billion by the end of 2010. This Community financing was allocated to three sub-programmes in the field of gas and electricity infrastructure projects; offshore wind electricity projects (OWE), and carbon capture and storage projects (CCS). It is estimated in the report from the Commission of 27 April 2010 on the implementation of the EEPR that almost the entire EEPR financial envelope will be committed in the course of spring 2010. An amount of around €114 million will however not be committed under the EEPR Regulation. The amount of uncommitted funds will be known by the end of 2010. In the spirit of the Europe 2020 strategy for sustainable growth and jobs, the development of further renewable sources and the promotion of energy efficiency would contribute to Greener Growth, building a competitive and sustainable economy, and tackling climate change. By giving support to these policies, Europe will create new jobs and green market opportunities fostering the development of a competitive, secure and sustainable economy. Providing for increased financial incentive and technical assistance is a key element to address the barriers of high up-front cost and lack of information and stimulate sustainable energy improvements. In a market constrained by the prevailing economical crises and in a time of caution by commercial banks, generating low investment rates, there are additional barriers for project financing to promote this policy area. Existing experiences across Europe demonstrate how well-targeted and well-designed financial aid policies can lead to massive improvement and succeed to tap the development potential of sustainable energy. Investments help in sustainable energy can be most effective and beneficial when targeted at municipal and local levels. In the 2nd Strategic Energy Review, the European Commission's announced its intention to launch a Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative in cooperation with the European Investment Bank and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in order to establish appropriate financing mechanisms for the massive development of energy efficiency and renewable energies. A dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives within the Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative should therefore be created to use the uncommitted funds under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 663/2009. IMPACT ANALYSIS: no impact analysis was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(1)(c) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to use the uncommitted funds under Chapter II of the EEPR Regulation for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives within the Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative. The financial facility shall support the development of bankable energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and facilitate the financing of investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, in particular in urban settings. In order to foster a large number of decentralised investments, municipal, local and regional public authorities will be the beneficiaries. The approach will build up on the success of the Covenant of Mayors, signed up by more than 1600 regions and cities across Europe. The sustainable energy projects to be financed include public and private buildings, high energy efficient combined heat and power (CHP) and district heating/cooling networks (in particular from renewable energy sources), decentralised renewable energy sources embedded in local settings, clean urban transport and local infrastructure such as smart grids, efficient street lighting, and smart metering. So as to maximise the impact of the EU funding in the short term, the facility should be managed by one or several financial intermediaries such as International Financial Institutions (IFIs). The selection should be operated on the basis of the demonstrated capacity of the financial intermediaries to use the funding in the most efficient and effective way and with the highest leverage between the EU funding and the total investment in order to raise significant investments in the EU. In compliance with Regulation (EC) No 663/2009, the facility should be limited to the financing of measures that have a rapid, measurable and substantial impact on economic recovery within the EU, increased energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 should fully apply to the selection and eligibility of the measures financed under the facility. The geographical balance of the projects should also be taken into account as an essential element. Since the exact amount of uncommitted funds may be known just by the end of 2010, individual legal commitments implementing budgetary commitments should be made by 31 March 2011. Due to the urgent need to address the economic crises and the Union's pressing energy needs, expenditure should be eligible as from 13 July 2009 as many applicants requested the eligibility of expenditure from the submission of the grant application in line with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (Financial Regulation). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the European Union’s budget."

4755EP8,"""""Sustainable management of external fishing fleets""""",0.629,0.86,0.94,0.812,0.212,0.925,0.791,0.808,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to propose new rules to improve the monitoring of the international fishing activities of the European fleet. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal is made in the context of the implementation of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which promotes in particular a sustainable, ecosystem-based and precautionary approach to fisheries management, emphasising the coherence between its internal and external dimension. Union fishing activities outside Union waters should be based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under Union law in the area of the CFP. Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities (the ‘FAR Regulation’) deals with authorisations of Union vessels to fish outside Union waters and authorisations granted to third country fishing vessels to operate in Union waters. Together with Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (‘the Control Regulation’) and Regulation (EC) no 1005/2008 on illegal and unregulated fishing (‘the IUU Regulation’), it is one of the three implementing pillars of the CFP. The Commission considers that the Union should be able to monitor its fleet wherever it operates and whatever the framework. The current FAR Regulation needs to be revised to properly address the objectives of the new CFP and to provide consistency with the Control Regulation. In its Communication on the external dimension of the CFP in 2011, the Commission proposed a revision to the FAR Regulation as an integral part of the CFP reform. The European Parliament supported this initiative in a resolution adopted in 2012. Several developments at international level also support the need for a revision. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: amongst the 5 options considered, one option would combine legal certainty with broader scope, thus leading to a complete framework regulating the activity of the EU external fleet abroad. For this reason, this option has been considered as the most effective option for achieving policy objectives, ensuring legal certainty and contributing to the international credibility of the Union. CONTENT : the proposed regulation would repeal Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 and sets out rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for Union fishing vessels operating in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country, under the auspices of a regional fisheries management organisation, in or outside Union waters, or on the high seas. The Regulation would also apply to third country fishing vessels operating in Union waters. The proposal aims to clarify the relationship to other rules dealing with authorisations, which may stem from the bilateral agreements or from the regional fisheries management organisations. These should be considered as special rules, whereas the present Regulation draws up the general framework. In the event of contradiction, the special rules should prevail. Fishing activities by Union vessels outside Union waters : the proposed regulation rests on the principle that every vessel should be authorised by its flag Member State before fishing outside Union waters, and by the coastal State when the activity takes place in its waters. The flag State should give this authorisation only if the eligibility criteria in the regulation are met, in any context. The responsibility of the flag State is central in this regard. A specific provision on reflagging allows the flag Member State to better identify when the reflagging operation indicates intended non-compliance that should prevent the authorisation being given. Traceability and proper follow-up of compliance history should be ensured throughout a vessel’s lifespan. The requirement that a unique vessel number be granted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) should also serve this purpose. Fishing activities by EU vessels in third country waters : the proposal specifies the additional conditions to be met by Union vessels in order to fish in third country waters, be it under an access agreement or a direct authorisation. A central element is the prohibition on fishing under a direct authorisation when an access agreement is in force, unless otherwise provided for in its exclusivity clause, which reflects this principle in the agreements. The principle is that the Union needs to ensure that the activities of its external fleet do not undermine the sustainability of living marine resources within the waters of coastal states. In the case of a direct authorisation, the flag Member State should follow the best available scientific advice and a precautionary approach when authorising its vessels. The Commission is provided with all the relevant information and can intervene if it has doubts as to the compliance of the planned fishing operation with the Regulation. Reallocation of under-utilised fishing opportunities in sustainable fisheries partnership agreements: a reallocation system is important to preserve Union financial interests and ensure that no fishing opportunity that has been paid for is wasted. The proposal aims to clarify and improve the reallocation system, which should be a last resort mechanism. Its application should be temporary and it should not affect the initial allocation of fishing opportunities among Member States. Reallocation should only occur once the relevant Member States have given up on their rights to exchange fishing opportunities among themselves. EU fishing activities under Regional fisheries Management Organisations (RFMO): the proposal lays down the process for carrying out fishing activities under the auspices of an RFMO or on the high seas. The Commission may intervene if it believes the eligibility criteria are not being met. Besides, since some RFMOs also cover Union waters, Union vessels under the auspices of such RFMOs should fall under the scope of the proposed regulation. Chartering of Union fishing vessels: the proposal lays down rules on chartering, which is a particular form of direct authorisation and which has been difficult to monitor so far. The main objective is to provide a legal framework for this practice to be able to better monitor Union vessels fishing under a chartering agreement and to align EU legislation with the rules adopted by some RFMOs in this regard. Control and reporting obligations : the proposal covers the application of the Control Regulation to the activities of the Union external fleet and related obligations in terms of reporting, together with some specific obligations related to the external nature of the activities. Fishing activities by third country vessels in Union waters : the objective is to ensure that fishing activities taking place in Union waters are subject to the same rules independently of the flag of the vessel, while promoting a level playing field for Union operators and third-country operators in Union waters. Fishing authorisation register : the proposal aims to create a fishing authorisation register to better monitor the Union external fleet and increase transparency regarding these activities, with part of the register being publicly accessible. People should be able to know at any time which vessel is authorised to fish what and where. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the dynamically growing Southeast Asian economies, with their over 600 million consumers and a rapidly rising middle class, are key markets for European Union exporters and investors. With a total EUR 208 billion of trade in goods and EUR 77 billion of trade in services (2016), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) taken as a whole is the EU’s third largest trading partner outside Europe, after the US and China. Within the ASEAN, Singapore is by far the EU’s largest partner. On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Member States of the ASEAN. On 12 September 2011, the Council authorised the Commission to extend the on-going negotiations with Singapore to cover also investment protection, based on a new EU competence under the Lisbon Treaty. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in 2011 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Singapore an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Singapore. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured the following: Trade committee: the institutional chapter of the FTA establishes a trade committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement. It shall be comprised of representatives of the EU and of Singapore who will meet every two years or at the request of either side. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU-Singapore FTA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It is estimated that foregone duties could reach an amount of EUR 248.8 million upon full implementation of the agreement. The estimate is based on average imports projected for 2025 in the absence of an agreement and represents the annual loss in revenues resulting from the elimination of EU tariffs on imports from Singapore. The EU-Singapore IPA is expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures. The agreement will be the EU’s second (after the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to incorporate the Investment Court System (ICS) for the resolution of disputes between investors and states. An amount of EUR 200 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2018 onwards (subject to the entry into force of the agreement) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal."

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea Bissau entered into force on 15 April 2008. The last Protocol to the Agreement entered into force on 24 November 2014 and expired on 23 November 2017. Following the Commission's recommendation, the Council decided on 28 February 2017 to authorise the opening of negotiations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau with a view to concluding a new protocol implementing the agreement. The Commission negotiated, on behalf of the Union, a new Protocol. As a result of those negotiations, the new Protocol was initialled on 15 November 2018. The Protocol shall be applied on a provisional basis from the date of its signature. It should now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea Bissau (2019-2024). The objective of the Protocol is to enable the Union and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to work more closely on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy, sound exploitation of fishery resources in Guinea-Bissau waters and efforts by Guinea-Bissau to develop a blue economy. The Agreement establishes the Joint Committee responsible for monitoring its implementation. The Commission may adopt certain amendments to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of these amendments, the Commission should be authorised, subject to specific substantive and procedural conditions, to approve them on behalf of the Union under a simplified procedure. The Union position on the modifications to the Protocol shall be established by the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States. The proposed amendments shall be accepted unless a blocking minority of the Member States objects in the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States."
5701EP7,"""""Electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits""""",0.877,0.875,0.93,0.645,0.455,0.904,0.872,0.829,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to align Directive 2006/95/EC on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits with the new legislative framework, in particular to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (Goods Package). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The changes made to the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC concern: the definitions, the obligations of economic operators, the presumption of conformity provided by harmonised standards, the declaration of conformity, CE marking, the safeguard clause procedure and the conformity assessment procedures. The proposal does not change the scope and the safety objectives of Directive 2006/95. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the materials are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the electrical equipment bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2006/95/EC on the placing on the market of electrical equipment has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their electrical material complies with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when non-compliant electrical equipment is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget."
7447EP8,"""""Amending Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 with a view to adapting them to developments in the sector""""",0.043,0.199,0.02,0.354,0.019,0.478,0.691,0.019,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve the single market in road transport through amendments intended to eliminate causes for disparities and to ensure better enforcement of the rules. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (‘light commercial vehicles’): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 30 January 2020, following the approval of the European Parliament, the Council adopted Decision (EU) 2020/135 on the conclusion of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. The withdrawal agreement entered into force on 1 February 2020 and provides for a transitional period during which Union law applies to the United Kingdom and on its territory in accordance with the agreement. This period will end on 31 December 2020. On 25 February 2020, the Council adopted Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/266 authorising the opening of negotiations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on a new partnership agreement. The Commission was appointed as the Union's negotiator. On 24 December 2020, negotiations were concluded and the Parties agreed on the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and on the Agreement on security procedures for the exchange of classified information and its protection. CONTENT: the draft Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Security of Information Agreement fully respect the Treaties and preserve the integrity and the autonomy of the Union legal order. These agreements will not require the EU to amend its rules, regulations or standards in any regulated area. They promote the values, objectives, and interests of the Union, and ensure the consistency, effectiveness and continuity of its policies and actions. The envisaged partnership is based on the recognition of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, as well as the fight against climate change and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Failure to comply with any of these essential elements shall entitle the Parties to terminate or suspend the application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement or any supplementary agreement, in whole or in part. The Parties also affirm their willingness to ensure a high level of protection of personal data. The draft Trade and Cooperation Agreement consists of three main pillars: Comprehensive and balanced free trade agreement The draft agreement: - covers not just trade in goods and services, but also a broad range of other areas in the EU's interest, such as investment, competition, State aid, tax transparency, air and road transport, energy and sustainability, fisheries, data protection, and social security coordination; - provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin; - ensures a strong level playing field: all imports from the UK should comply with EU rules and regulations (e.g. technical rules and product standards, sanitary and phytosanitary rules, food and safety regulations, health and safety standards, environmental and consumer protection rules); - establishes a new framework for the joint management of fish stocks in their respective waters; - ensures a number of rights of EU citizens and UK nationals. This concerns EU citizens working in, travelling or moving to the UK and to UK nationals working in, travelling or moving to the EU after 1st January 2021; - enables the UK's continued participation in a number of flagship EU programmes for the period 2021-2027 (subject to a financial contribution by the UK to the EU budget), such as Horizon Europe. A new partnership for security The draft agreement establishes a framework for law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It recognises the need for close cooperation between national law enforcement and judicial authorities and EU agencies and bodies, in particular as regards the fight against and prosecution of cross-border crime and terrorism. It respects the status of the United Kingdom as a non-member of the EU outside the Schengen area. Police and judicial cooperation is based on guarantees of respect for democracy and the rule of law, and effective protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, including those enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. There are specific provisions on the suspension of cooperation in the event of serious and systemic failures in the implementation of any of these safeguards, as well as a specific dispute settlement mechanism. A horizontal agreement on governance The governance provisions clarify how the Trade and Cooperation Agreement should be implemented and monitored. The Agreement provides for the possibility for the Parties to take swift, autonomous and operational measures to protect their interests, in particular in the areas of the level playing field (i.e. rebalancing measures, remedial measures) and fisheries (i.e. compensatory measures, remedial measures), as well as, more generally, in cases of serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties of a sectorial or regional nature. The Partnership Council, composed of representatives of the Union and the United Kingdom at ministerial level, should monitor the implementation of the agreement. Security for the exchange of information The draft supplementary agreement on security procedures for the exchange of classified information and its protection sets out rules and modalities for the exchange of classified and unclassified sensitive information. It guarantees the secure treatment of sensitive information, based on the principle of the originator’s consent prior to the release of the information exchanged."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council invited the Commission to consider establishing minimum procedural rights for suspects or accused persons, and to address the issue of presumption of innocence, in order to promote better cooperation in that area. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on provisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant proceedings; (ii) a directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings Moreover, on 14 June 2011, the Commission published a Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention to reflect on ways to strengthen the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the area of detention, within the limits of the EU's competence. The principle of presumption of innocence has been developed over the years. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has held that Article 6(2) of the ECHR encompasses three key requirements: (i) the right not to be publicly presented as convicted by public authorities before the final judgment; (ii) the fact that the burden of proof is on prosecution and that any reasonable doubts on guilt should benefit the accused; and (iii) the right of the accused to be informed of the accusation against him. The right to be present at trial is also an essential right of defence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission’s analysis considers that there exist points in which legal safeguards should be improved with regard to certain aspects the presumption of innocence to strengthen this fundamental right. CONTENT: the draft directive aims to lay down minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the right of suspects and accused persons to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty by a final judgment. The proposal covers the following rights: 1) The right not to be presented guilty by public authorities before the final judgment : the ECtHR established as one of the basic aspects of the principle of presumption of innocence the fact that a court or public official may not publicly present the suspects or accused persons as if they were guilty of an offence if they have not been tried and convicted of it by a final judgment. 2) The burden of proof is on prosecution and any reasonable doubts on the guilt should benefit the accused: this presupposes that a court's judgment must be based on evidence as put before it and not on mere allegations or assumptions. 3) The right not to incriminate one-self and not to cooperate and the right to remain silent: these rights lie at the heart of the notion of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR. ·  the right not to incriminate oneself presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression; ·  the right to remain silent must be ensured and any inferences drawn from the fact that suspects make use of this right should be excluded. Suspects should be promptly informed of their right to remain silent. Such information should also refer to the content of the right to remain silent and of the consequences of renouncing to it and of invoking it. 4) Right to be present at one's trial : the proposal lays down this right, established by the ECtHR, of an accused to be present at the trial and also establishes limited exceptions to this right, in line with the Charter, the ECHR and EU law. It provides that Member States must ensure that the right to be present applies to any trial aiming at assessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both conviction and acquittal decisions).

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit in May 2009, the EU reaffirmed its political support towards full liberalisation of the visa regime in a secure environment, and towards promoting mobility by concluding visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Eastern Partnership countries. According to the common approach for the development of EU policy on visa facilitation agreed at the level of COREPER by the Member States in December 2005, a visa facilitation agreement would not be concluded without a readmission agreement being in place. On that basis, the Commission presented on 12 November 2010, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate Agreements with the Republic of Belarus on, respectively, the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas, and readmission of persons residing without authorisation. Negotiations with Belarus were officially opened in Brussels on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an agreement initialled on 17 June 2019. In the meantime, Belarus, the European Union and seven participating Member States (Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Finland and Latvia) signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership on 13 October 2016. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and Belarus to facilitate the readmission of persons residing without authorisation. The purpose of the Agreement is to establish rapid and effective procedures for the identification and safe and orderly return of persons who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, presence in, or residence on the territory of Belarus or one of the Member States of the European Union, and to facilitate the transit of such persons in a spirit of co-operation. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - an opening clause reaffirming that the agreement must be applied in such a way as to ensure respect for human rights and the obligations and responsibilities of the requested and requesting States under the international instruments applicable to them; - readmission obligations on the basis of full reciprocity, applying to nationals as well as third-country nationals and stateless persons; - obligation to readmit nationals also concerning (i) former nationals who have been deprived of their nationality or who have renounced it without obtaining the nationality of another State; (ii) family members (i.e. spouse and unmarried minor children), whatever their nationality, who do not have an independent right of residence in the requesting State; - obligation to readmit third-country nationals and stateless persons subject to certain preconditions. This obligation does not apply to persons who have only carried out airport transit or who have obtained a visa or residence permit from the requested Member State unless, for example, the person does not comply with one of the conditions attached to the visa; - definition of the technical modalities governing the readmission procedure (readmission application, means of evidence, time limits, transfer modalities and modes of transport). Procedural flexibility is provided by the fact that no readmission application will be needed in cases where the person to be readmitted is in possession of a valid travel document; - description of the agreed accelerated procedure for persons apprehended in an area extending up to 30 kilometres beyond the common land border between a Member State and Belarus, as well as on the territory of the international airports of the Member States and Belarus. - necessary rules on costs, data protection and the position of the agreement in relation to other international obligations. In particular, the proposal for a Decision specifies that the Commission, assisted by experts from the Member States, shall represent the Union in the Joint Readmission Committee established by the Agreement. The specific situation of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is reflected in the preamble, and, regarding Denmark, in a relevant joint declaration."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport (the ITS Directive) requires that specifications be adopted, through delegated acts, for actions in four priority areas. Since the entry into force of Directive 2010/40/EU, four delegated acts relating to priority actions of that Directive have been adopted by the Commission. They address in particular eCall and data sharing mechanisms facilitating the electronic data exchange between the relevant public authorities and stakeholders and the relevant ITS service providers. There is a need for further delegated acts regarding actions still to be addressed and belonging to the scope of Directive 2010/40/EU. Not extending the delegation of power to the Commission would endanger the EU-wide integrated and coordinated deployment of interoperable ITS in road transport and their interfaces with other transport modes. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to extend the delegation of power for an additional period of five years starting from 27 August 2017. This period should be tacitly extended for periods of the same duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council oppose such an extension."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Council Regulation No (EC) 207/2009). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an increasingly competitive environment, the growing number of trade mark applications at both national and EU levels, and the growing number of trade mark users demonstrates the crucial role of trade marks in terms of market success and commercial value. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date. In its ‘ Small Business Act ’ of 2008, the Commission pledged to make the Community trademark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, in its 2008 Communication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe the Commission underlined its commitment to effective and efficient trademark protection and to a trademark system of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trademark system in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) and National Offices. Lastly, in its 2011 Intellectual Property Rights Strategy for Europe, the Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a view to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it more effective, efficient and consistent overall. The Council has also called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identified one main problem that the revised Regulation needs to address: the low level of cooperation among trade mark offices in Europe. The following options were considered to solve the problems and to achieve three corresponding objectives. ·  Providing an adequate legal basis for cooperation: Option 1: no specific legal basis; Option 2: legal basis allowing optional cooperation; Option 3: legal basis obliging mandatory cooperation. ·  Technical capacity building at National Offices : Option 1: each office to procure and develop the required facilities and tools; Option 2: optional access to tools; Option 3: mandatory access to tools. ·  Securing long-term financing for cooperation activities : Option 1: from Member States; Option 2: from EU budget; Option 3: from OHIM budget. The impact assessment concluded that option 3 (legal basis obliging mandatory cooperation, mandatory access to tools, and financing from OHIM budget) would in all cases be proportionate and best suited to achieving the objectives pursued. LEGAL BASIS: Article 118 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the main common objective of this initiative and of the parallel proposal for the recast of Directive 2008/95/EC is to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and efficient in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and legal security. As regards this proposal to revise the Regulation, the Commission is not proposing a new system, but well-targeted modernisation of existing provisions, with the main aims being: 1) Adapting the terminology in the Regulation to the Lisbon Treaty and adapting provisions to the Common Approach on decentralised agencies : throughout the Regulation, the term ‘Community trade mark’ is replaced by ‘European trade mark’. The term “Office”, insofar as it refers to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, is replaced by the term ‘Agency’. 2) Streamlining procedures to apply for and register a European trade mark: ·  since National Offices hardly ever receive applications for European trade marks any more, the option for filing these at National Offices should be abolished; ·  with regard to the filing date, it is proposed to abolish the one-month period and to link the ‘obligation’ to pay with the filing of the application, so that applicants will have to provide evidence that they submitted or authorised their payment when they filed their application; ·  current search regimes are abolished, in view of the fact that they do not provide a reliable trade mark clearance tool; ·  the current one-month period between the Agency notifying the applicant of search reports and publication of the application is abolished, which will speed up the registration procedure. 3) Increasing legal certainty by clarifying provisions and removing ambiguities: ·  the proposed new definition of a European trademark leaves the door open to registering matter that can be represented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees; ·  the absolute grounds for refusal are fully aligned with the EU law on geographical indications; ·  it is clarified that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier rights; ·  in cases of both double identity and similarity, it is only the origin function which matters; ·  in accordance with the rulings of the Court of Justice, it is appropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met; ·  the trade mark owner may prevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC; ·  it is clarified that goods may not be imported into the EU even if only the consignor is acting for commercial purposes. ·  bearing in mind the outcome of the Philips/Nokia judgment, the proposal entitles right holders to stop third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing an unauthorised trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the Union, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation; Other amendments concern the following provisions: limitation of the effects of a European trademark; designation and classification of goods and services; European certification marks, and tasks of the Agency, which are defined in one new Article. 4) Establishing an appropriate framework for cooperation between OHIM and national offices to promote convergence of practices and developing common tools: the proposal contains provisions for mandatory cooperation between the Agency and Member States, and stipulates the main areas for cooperation and specific common projects of Union interest which the Agency will coordinate. It further sets up a funding mechanism enabling the Agency to finance those common projects by means of grants. 5) Aligning the framework to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
12871EP9,"""""Distortive foreign subsidies""""",0.887,0.885,0.865,0.781,0.632,0.88,0.851,0.683,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to propose a new instrument to address the potentially distorting effects of foreign subsidies in the single market. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a strong, open and competitive single market allows both European and foreign companies to compete on the basis of merit, provided that a level playing field in the market is guaranteed. In recent years, there have been cases where foreign subsidies have been found to have distorting effects on the EU's internal market, creating an uneven playing field. These foreign subsidies can take different forms, such as zero interest loans, unlimited state guarantees, tax exemptions or reductions for foreign investment or trade, or dedicated State funding. EU rules on competition, public procurement and trade defence instruments play an important role in ensuring a level playing field for companies operating in the single market. However, none of these tools apply to foreign subsidies that give their beneficiaries an unfair advantage when acquiring EU companies, participating in public procurement in the EU or doing other business in the EU. There are currently no specific EU rules to address the distorting effects that foreign subsidies can have on the internal market. It is therefore necessary to complement the existing EU instruments with a new instrument to effectively combat distortions in the internal market caused by foreign subsidies and to ensure a level playing field The legislative proposal aims to fill a regulatory gap in the Single Market. It is in line with the new Industrial Strategy for Europe presented by the Commission in March 2020 and follows the adoption of the White Paper on foreign subsidies in June 2020. CONTENT: the proposed regulation establishes rules and procedures for investigating foreign subsidies that distort the internal market and for remedying the distortions they cause. Such distortions may affect all economic activities, in particular in the case of mergers and public procurement procedures. Under the proposed Regulation, the Commission will have the power to investigate financial contributions granted by public authorities of a non-EU country which benefit companies engaging in an economic activity in the EU and redress their distortive effects, as relevant. In this context, the Regulation proposes the introduction of three tools: - Component 1: a notification-based tool to investigate concentrations involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the EU turnover of the company to be acquired (or of at least one of the merging parties) is EUR 500 million or more and the foreign financial contribution is at least EUR 50 million; - Component 2: a notification-based tool to investigate bids in public procurements involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the estimated value of the procurement is EUR 250 million or more; and - Component 3: a tool to investigate all other market situations and smaller concentrations and public procurement procedures, which the Commission can start on its own initiative (ex-officio) and may request ad-hoc notifications. Ex officio examination of subsidies . The proposal provides that the Commission could, on its own initiative, examine information from any source concerning alleged distortive foreign subsidies, either as a preliminary examination or as a full investigation. It would be able to conduct on-site inspections in the EU and elsewhere. The Commission should take into account the positive effects of the foreign subsidy on the development of the subsidised economic activity in question. It should balance these positive effects against the negative effects of a foreign subsidy in terms of distortion in the internal market. If the negative effects outweigh the positive effects, the Commission could impose remedial measures or accept undertakings from the companies concerned to remedy the distortions. The proposal foresees a range of structural or behavioural remedies, such as divestment of certain assets or prohibition of a certain market behaviour. The Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments for procedural infringements, such as the supply of incorrect or incomplete information in an investigation, and for non-compliance with a Commission decision imposing redressive, interim measures or commitments. Concentration and bids in public procurement As regards mergers and public procurement, the proposal involves a system of ex ante notification of the largest and potentially most distortive case. It sets out the conditions under which a foreign subsidy is considered to distort the internal market. The Commission would have the power, upon notification, to examine information on foreign financial contributions in the context of a proposed merger. Companies should not be allowed to implement the concentration before the conclusion of the Commission's review. The proposal specifies when a concentration should be suspended and sets out the relevant time limits. The proposed Regulation provides that if an undertaking fails to comply with the obligation to notify a subsidised concentration or a financial contribution in the context of public procurement contracts meeting the thresholds, the Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments. Fines and periodic penalty payments could also be imposed in the case of notifications containing incorrect information or in the case of failure to notify. In case of notified transactions, the Commission should also have the power to prohibit the subsidised acquisition or the award of the public procurement contract to the subsidised bidder. Budgetary impact The total administrative expenditure for the implementation of the proposal in 2021-2027 will thus amount to EUR 90.340 million, part of which will be financed from the single market programme."
1148EP8,"""""Market stability reserve for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme""""",0.6,0.778,0.96,0.0,0.058,0.866,0.843,0.212,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish a market stability reserve for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the start of the third trading period (2013-2020), the EU ETS was characterised by a large imbalance between supply and demand of allowances, resulting in a surplus of around 2 billion allowances that is expected to grow over the coming years to more than 2.6 billion allowances by 2020. The reason for this imbalance is primarily a mismatch between the auction supply of emission allowances, which is fixed in a very rigid manner, and demand for them, which is flexible and impacted by economic cycles, fossil fuel prices as well as other drivers. Weakened demand usually goes together with decreasing supply. However, in the EU carbon market this is not the case for auction supply in the current regulatory regime. The EU ETS was set up to deliver EU emissions reduction goals in a harmonised and cost- effective manner. While the environmental objective is guaranteed by the cap, the presence of a large surplus reduces the incentives for low-carbon investment and has a negative effect on the cost-efficiency of the system. In short, if not addressed, these imbalances will profoundly affect the ability of the EU ETS to meet the ETS target in future phases in a cost- effective manner. The Commission report on the state of the European carbon market in 2102 identified the need for measures to tackle structural supply-demand imbalances. This imbalance is expected to continue, and would not be sufficiently addressed by adapting the linear trajectory to a more stringent target within this framework. A change in the linear factor only changes gradually the cap. Accordingly, the surplus would also only gradually decline, such that the market would have to continue to operate for more than a decade with a surplus of around 2 billion allowances or more. In order to address this problem and to make the European Emission Trading System more resilient to imbalances, a market stability reserve should be established. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment shows that :(i) the establishment of a market stability reserve could help address the current imbalances; (ii) such a reserve would make the ETS more resilient to any potential future large-scale event that may severely disturb the supply-demand balance; (iii) operating the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation has the advantage of capturing changes in demand. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a market stability reserve for the EU ETS, as part of the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies. This market stability reserve will operate as of phase 4 starting in 2021 to provide market participants with the necessary certainty as regards the auction supply during phase 3 and an appropriate lead-time for the introduction of the reserve. To ensure predictability, the market stability reserve is designed as an objective and rule- based mechanism on the basis of which the auction volumes are adjusted in an ""automatic manner"" under pre-defined conditions Market stability reserve : the market stability reserve functions by triggering adjustments to annual auction volumes in situations where the total number of allowances in circulation is outside a certain predefined range: · adding allowances to the reserve by deducting them from future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary surplus in the EU ETS if the total surplus is higher than 833 million allowances; · releasing allowances from the reserve and adding them to future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary deficit in the EU ETS provided the total surplus is below 400 million allowances. Allowances are thus placed in and released from the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation. To ensure predictability and more gradual changes to the market stability reserve, a pre- defined volume of 100 million allowances per year would be released from the reserve where the conditions are met. This quantity represents roughly 5% of the current annual emissions in the EU ETS which based on historical experience should be sufficient to cater for even very sudden and strong increases in demand. The proposal also contains provisions aimed at smoothening auctioning supply in the years around transitions between trading phases in cases where the default would otherwise have resulted in sharp changes. If the volume of allowances that should be auctioned in the last year of the period exceeds the average amount to be auctioned in the two following years by more than 30%, this difference will be evenly distributed over these years. This provision builds on the experience gained in the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 of the EU ETS."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the International Science and Technology Centre ('ISTC') was set up in 1994 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was funded together with other Parties (USA, Canada, and Japan) through an international multilateral agreement for the purpose of non-proliferation of scientific and technical expertise related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Over time, other Parties joined the Agreement, i.e. Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan, Republic of Korea, Norway, Russian Federation and Tajikistan. The ISTC works at the crossroads between scientific research and non-proliferation, and has funded almost 3000 projects with a total value of over EUR 550 million. The Union contribution amounts to approximately EUR 270 million. In the latest years the concept and the work of the ISTC as a science centre evolved to take into account the changing proliferation landscape, the results of threat analyses and the evolving needs of the parties. It increasingly focused on supporting projects aiming at mitigation of broader Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear risks, not necessarily focused on scientists' redirection, but on promoting bio safety and biosecurity, physical upgrades of laboratories as well as stimulation of networking activities among relevant scientific communities. Following the 2010 announced withdrawal of the Russian Federation, that becomes effective on 15 July 2015, the Parties agreed that a new Agreement needs to be put in place in order for the Centre to effectively fulfil its mandate under changed circumstances. On 21 October 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to start negotiations. The aims set out in the negotiating directives have been fully met. In accordance with the Council Decision (EU) 2015/1989 the Agreement continuing the International Science and Technology Centre between the European Union and Euratom acting as one Party and Georgia, Japan, Norway, the Kyrgyz Republic, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Tajikistan, and the United States of America was signed on 9 December 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has led to significant changes both in the framework for the adoption of delegated and implementing acts and for the conduct of trade policy. As regards the adoption of delegated and implementing acts the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union clearly distinguishes between the two: the provisions of the Treaty on delegated acts, which are set out in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, provide for the legislator to control the exercise of the Commission's powers by means of a right of revocation and/or a right of objection; the provisions of the Treaty on implementing acts, which are set out in Article 291, do not provide any role for the European Parliament and the Council to control the Commission's exercise of implementing powers. Such control can only be exercised by the Member States. A legal framework establishing the mechanisms of such control is set out in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers. As regards trade policy, the Treaty of Lisbon provides that the ordinary legislative procedure applies, meaning that for the first time the European Parliament is fully associated in the conduct of trade policy. In relation to the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 the Commission stated that it will proceed to an examination of all legislative acts in force which were not adapted to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in order to assess if those instruments need to be adapted to the regime of delegated acts introduced by Article 290 of the TFEU. It will make the appropriate proposals as soon as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he present proposal results from the Commission's examination of the legislative acts in the field of trade policy. Legislation in the field of trade policy has not been adapted in the past to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. This proposal accompanies a first proposal the Commission has made on trade policy, referred to as ""Trade Omnibus I"") amends certain regulations relating to the common commercial policy as regards procedures where the Council was involved in decision-making which were not based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. It proposes that such procedures be converted into either delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty or implementing acts pursuant to Article 291. The current proposal examines all remaining decision-making procedures found in trade policy legislation in order to adapt them, where appropriate, to the regime for delegated acts set down in Article 290. In principle these are decision-making procedures based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC. The proposal concerns 10 basic acts. Where appropriate, the Commission proposes that certain procedures be converted into delegated acts as set down in Article 290."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union’s economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aiming to amend Directive 1993/31/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste; Directive 1994/62/EC on package and packaging waste; Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles; Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators; Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets ‘fit for purpose’; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction – more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the targets laid down in Council Directive 1999/31/EC14 setting landfill restrictions to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy and make progress in the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative by reducing landfilling of waste destined for landfills for non-hazardous waste. The main points are as follows: Alignment of definitions : it is proposed that municipal waste should be clearly defined in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The definitions in Directives 1999/31/EC should be aligned to those of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Reduction in landfill waste: Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of the target. In the event of an extension, the Member State should take the necessary measures to reduce by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 20% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. By 31 December 2024 at the latest , the Commission should examine the target with a view to reducing it and introducing restrictions to the landfilling of non-hazardous waste other than municipal waste. To this end, the Commission should send a report accompanied by a proposal, if appropriate, shall be sent to the European Parliament and the Council.

386EP8,"""""Interchange fees for card-based payment transactions""""",0.757,0.932,0.94,0.667,0.135,0.881,0.916,0.808,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to lay down uniform technical and business requirements on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the regulatory and legislative framework for retail payments in the EU has been developed over the past 12 years, with the advent of the Euro acting as an accelerating factor. One of the key practices hindering the achievement of an integrated market reasons is the widespread use of so-called Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs). At present, no legislation regulating interchange fees is in place in the EU. MIFs are collectively agreed inter-bank fees usually between the acquiring payment service providers and the issuing payment service providers belonging to a certain scheme. Such interchange fees paid by acquiring payment service providers form part of the fees they charge to merchants which merchants in turn pass on to consumers. Thus, high Interchange Fees paid by merchants result in higher final prices for goods and services, which are paid by all consumers. There currently is a wide variety of interchange fees applied within national and international payment card schemes, which gives rise to market fragmentation and prevents retailers and consumers from enjoying the benefits of an internal market for goods and services. Market entry for pan-European players remains difficult, as domestic interchange fees in EU Member States vary widely and new entrants would have to offer interchange fees at least comparable to those prevailing in each market they want to enter. The entry barriers interchange fees thus created for online and mobile payment solutions also result in less innovation. Over the last 20 years, the European Commission and national competition authorities have conducted a number of antitrust proceedings addressing anti-competitive practices in the card payment market. The General Court judgment of May 2012 confirmed the Commission's finding in its MasterCard Decision of December 2007 that MIFs restrict competition as they inflate the cost of card acceptance by merchants without leading to benefits for consumers. In its non-legislative resolution of 20 November 2012 on the Green Paper 'Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments”, the Parliament took a firm position in favour of providing clarity on interchange fees to market participants and expressed itself in favour of a gradual approach leading to a ban on interchange fees through regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considers six scenarios for interchange fees. The assessment concludes that the most beneficial option appears to be a combination of: capping the level of interchange fees for cross-border transactions with consumer debit and credit cards (in the first stage) and, in a second stage, capping the level of interchange fees also for domestic transactions with consumer credit cards and consumer debit cards; a series of measures to enhance effective market functioning including the limitation of the rule allowing merchants to determine the choice of card brand at the point of sale for all cards and card-based transactions based on four party scheme models. CONTENT: the present regulation, combined with the proposed revised Payment Services Directive, proposes to create common rules for interchange fees in the European Union by introducing maximum fee levels for transactions with payment cards that are widely used by consumers and thereby difficult to refuse or surcharge by retailers. The regulation will in addition propose transparency measures to allow retailers and consumers to make better informed choices of payment instruments. Capping interchange fees : the Commission proposes to set caps for interchange fees to payment service providers of 0.2% and 0.3% for the value of the transaction for all consumer debit and credit transactions. These figures have been accepted by Visa, MasterCard and the French domestic card scheme Groupement Cartes Bancaires. During a transition period of two years, maximum levels of interchange fees are imposed for cross-border transactions (where the card holder uses their card in another Member State) or cross-border acquired transactions (where the merchant uses an acquiring PSP in another Member State) only. After a transitional period, the regulation of interchange fees for consumer cards should therefore be extended to cover also domestic interchange fees. Business rules : the proposed Regulation contains measures as regards business rules that will be applicable to all categories of card transactions and card-based payment transactions based on those. As of the entry into force of the regulation, for instance: the application of the 'Honour All Cards Rule' will be limited. No discrimination will be nonetheless allowed on the basis of the issuing bank or the provenance of the card holder and between the cards carrying the same interchange fee level; the application of any rule preventing or limiting merchants from steering customers to more efficient payments instruments ('no steering rules') will be prohibited; acquiring Payment Service Providers will provide at least monthly statements of fees to merchants, in which the fees paid by the merchant over the relevant month concerning each category of cards and each individual brand for when the acquirer provides acquiring services is specified; the application of any rule withholding merchants from disclosing to their customers fees they pay to payment services acquirers will be prohibited. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since early 2011, the Jordanian economy has been significantly affected by the ongoing regional unrest, notably in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Combined with a weaker global environment, this regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. The Syrian conflict has impacted Jordan not only by disrupting trade with and through Syria but also by causing an inflow of around 1.3 million of Syrian refugees into Jordan that has increased pressure on Jordan's fiscal position, public services and infrastructure. In 2012, Jordan and the IMF agreed on a first adjustment programme, which was supported by a three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 2 billion. This programme was successfully completed in August 2015. The IMF programme was complemented by a first Macro-Financial Assistance from the European Union (the EU) in the amount of EUR 180 million (MFA-I), which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in December 2013 and was disbursed in two tranches of EUR 100 million and EUR 80 million in February 2015 and in October 2015, respectively. While the country made progress with macroeconomic stabilisation and reform under the first programme supported by the IMF, the EU and other donors, the persistence of the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq continued to disrupt Jordan's foreign trade and undermine investor and tourist confidence, with the economic situation deteriorating again in 2015. In this context, the Jordanian government has called for increased support from the international community to address the economic consequences of the Syrian crisis, and in particular the presence of a large number of Syrian refugees in Jordan. At the conference 'Supporting Syria and the Region', held in London on 4 February 2016, the international community pledged about USD 10 billion to help the countries most affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. Of this amount, the EU pledged EUR 2.39 billion for the countries affected by the Syrian refugee crisis including a EUR 200 million loan for the purpose of a second Macro-Financial Assistance operation for Jordan (MFA-II). This is the aim of this proposal. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Jordan for a total maximum amount of EUR 200 million, provided in the form of a medium-term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2016-2017, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments of EUR 100 million each. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place towards the end of 2016. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the second quarter of 2017. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable? The loans shall have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Conditions granting assistance : the Union's macro-financial assistance should support Jordan's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the respect for human rights. Disbursements : the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. The Commission and the Jordanian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding aiming to improve the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth. These reform measures would support the authorities’ reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF, the World Bank and other donors, as well as the policy programmes associated with the EU’s budgetary support operations. They would be consistent with the economic reform priorities agreed between the EU and Jordan in the context of the Single Support Framework for 2014-2017 and other strategic documents (including the future Partnership Priorities and the Jordan Compact). They would also build upon the structural reforms implemented under MFA-I. Availability of assistance : the proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Implementing powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used in this context. Follow-up and reporting : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and would be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning of the EU's Guarantee Fund for external actions, at a rate of 9 % of the amounts disbursed, from budget line 01 03 06 (""Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) will be made in 2016 and the second loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) in 2017 in accordance with the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-19 budgets. Based on current projections on the utilisation of the budget line 01 03 06, the Commission assesses that the budgetary impact of the operation can be accommodated."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASE: Article 42 and Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: in view of the fact that since it was adopted on 30 January 2006, Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been the subject of several amendments, it is proposed that it be recast in the interests of clarity. Furthermore, changes in Community legislation and the practical implementation of this Regulation that have occurred since it was adopted, make it necessary to modify certain provisions and to restructure the legislative text so that it reflects more effectively the reality of the POSEI agricultural scheme. The main amendments are as follows: Subject: the Regulation lays down specific measures for agriculture to mitigate the difficulties caused by extreme remoteness, specifically remoteness, isolation, small surface areas, terrain, difficult climate and economic dependence on a limited number of products of the outermost regions. Objectives: the proposal is more explicit in setting out the scheme’s main objectives: The specific measures shall help to meet the following objectives: guaranteed supply to the outermost regions of products essential for human consumption or for processing and as agricultural inputs by mitigating the additional costs due to extreme remoteness; preservation and development of agricultural activities in the outermost regions, including the production, processing and the sale of local products. These objectives shall be implemented by means of the measures referred to in Chapters III, IV and V. Structure: the new structure highlights the central role played by the Programmes of Options Specifically Relating to the Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI programmes) which have now been defined for each outermost region at the most appropriate level and coordinated by the relevant Member States. These programmes relate to the two fundamental POSEI elements, namely the specific supply arrangements and the specific measures in favour of local production. POSEI : the measures provided for are defined for each outermost region by a POSEI Programme which shall comprise: a) specific supply arrangements and b) specific measures to assist local agricultural production. The POSEI programme shall be established at the geographical level which the Member State concerned deems most appropriate. It shall be prepared by the competent authorities designated by the said Member State, which shall submit it to the Commission for approval after the competent authorities and organisations at the appropriate regional level have been consulted. A single POSEI programme may be submitted for each Member State in respect of its outermost regions. Other amendments : minor amendments have been made to the wording of the Regulation, in particular: the procedure for submitting programmes and amendments for approval to the Commission has been specified to make it more consistent with current practice and in view of the need for greater flexibility and efficiency as regards the process of adapting programmes to meet the actual needs of agriculture and the supply of products essential for the outermost regions; it has been specified that the specific supply arrangements should be designed for each region in accordance with local agricultural production, the development of which should not be limited by aid for supply which is too excessive for products which are also produced locally. This provision is considered to be necessary to make it compulsory for the two POSEI instruments to be compatible with each other; the possibility of re-dispatching products which have been processed locally using basic products which have benefited from the specific supply arrangements, without the benefit being reimbursed, which was restricted to products dispatched from the Azores to Madeira or vice versa, or from Madeira to the Canary Islands or vice versa, will also now apply to the French overseas departments; in the interests of sound budgetary management, Member States must indicate in their programmes the list of aid constituting direct payments; it is also helpful to indicate how the aid amounts for measures to assist local agricultural products are defined, which was previously not indicated in the basic act; lastly, the financial allocation for each national programme selected is that which corresponds to the 2011 financial year and subsequent years. However, the ceiling for financing for the specific supply arrangements for France and Portugal has increased by 20%, in the light of the conclusions of the first report on the impact of the 2006 POSEI reform, submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in 2010. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not affect the sources of financing or the “intensity of Community support.”"

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: the scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008, carried out in 2011, stated that the cod plan has not achieved its objectives and that they are unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Furthermore, the report revealed that there are flaws in the design of the Regulation and problems with its implementation. The Commission is proposing an amendment to the Regulation in the light of this advice and of the opinions received from Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and the Member States. The proposal for the amendment of the Regulation does not cover all the problems identified since this amendment is intended as an interim solution pending the development and implementation of a mixed-fishery plan for North Sea fisheries as anticipated in the reform. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal was drawn up on the basis of consultations with the Member States and stakeholders. LEGAL BASE: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENTS: the main legal action is as far as possible to improve and clarify the provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 that were identified in the evaluation as problematic, in particular: ·  the changes to Article 4 (Calculation of fishing effort) aim at closing the unintended possibility for Member States to deploy higher levels of effort than the plan was meant to allow simply by changing the methods used for the calculation of effort when establishing the baselines and when calculating usage; ·  Article 9 (Special procedure for setting TACs) defines a procedure for TAC setting in the absence of the necessary information to apply Article 7 or 8. Instead of automatic reductions of 25% it is proposed to take a case-by-case, and therefore a more flexible, approach though remaining firmly based on available scientific advice; ·  instead of exempting groups of vessels specified by each Member State, exemptions are now based on criteria that would be generally applicable for any vessels that meet them, regardless of the Member State to which they belong. The amended Article also avoids the need for constant adjustments of the baseline by Council; ·  transitional measures will ensure that vessels groups already excluded will be subject to the criteria in force at the time of exclusion; ·  vessels involved in the fully documented fishery trials , where all catches are counted against quota, are exempted from fishing effort regime; ·  a new proposal foresees the possibility for the Council to decide not to apply further fishing effort reductions, once the fishing-effort ceiling has been reduced for four consecutive years; ·  it is now made clear that the condition that cod catch are less than 5 % of the total refers to the catch composition over the management period, not per trip; ·  in Article 14, the Member State obligation to address the discard issue is strengthened since it is not the case under the current ruling, and level of control and monitoring is specified according to risk-based management; ·  the Committee procedure is brought into line with the rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Decision (EU) 2017/1324 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for the participation of the Union in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The strategic objective of PRIMA is to build research and innovation capacities and to develop knowledge and common innovative solutions for agro-food systems in order to make them sustainable, as well as for an integrated water supply and management in the Mediterranean area. PRIMA will be jointly undertaken by a number of Member States and third countries with a high level of commitment to scientific, management and financial integration and under the same terms and conditions. Lebanon expressed its wish to join PRIMA as a Participating State and pledged to commit a financial contribution of EUR 7 million to the initiative. The negotiations started on 26 June 2017 and were successfully completed on 27 July 2017, when the text of the draft Agreement was initialled by representatives from each of the future Parties. In order to ensure that Lebanon participates in PRIMA on an equal footing with Member States and third countries associated to Horizon 2020, an International Agreement with the Union is required to extend the scope of the legal regime established by Decision (EU) 2017/1324 to Lebanon.

6015EP7,"""""Common European sales law""""",0.018,0.799,0.0,0.258,0.182,0.843,0.579,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve the establishment and the functioning of the internal market by facilitating the expansion of cross-border trade for business and cross-border purchases for consumers. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: differences in contract law between Member States and the additional transaction costs and complexity that they generate in cross-border transactions dissuade a considerable number of traders, in particular SME, from expanding into markets of other Member States. These differences also have the effect of limiting competition in the internal market. Currently, only one in ten traders in the Union exports goods within the Union and the majority of those who do, only export to a small number of Member States. The value of the trade foregone each year between Member States due to differences in contract law alone amounts to tens of billions of Euros. With its 2001 Communication on European contract law,  the Commission launched a process of extensive public consultation on the problems arising from differences between Member States' contract laws. In July 2010, the Commission launched a public consultation by publishing a 'Green Paper on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses', which set out different policy options on how to strengthen the internal market by making progress in the area of European contract law. In response to the Green Paper, the European Parliament issued a Resolution on 8 June 2011 in which it expressed its strong support for an instrument which would improve the establishment and the functioning of the internal market and bring benefits to traders, consumers and Member States' judicial systems. The Commission Communication 'Europe 2020' recognises the need to make it easier and less costly for traders and consumers to conclude contracts with partners in other Member States, notably by making progress towards an optional European contract law. The Digital Agenda for Europe envisages an optional instrument in European contract law to overcome the fragmentation of contract law and boost consumer confidence in e-commerce. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment analysed the seven policy options set out in the Green Paper. These options were: (1) the baseline scenario (no policy change); (2) a toolbox for the legislator; (3) a Recommendation on a Common European Sales Law; (4) a Regulation setting up an optional Common European Sales Law; (5) a Directive (full or minimum harmonisation) on a mandatory Common European Sales Law; (6i) a Regulation establishing a European contract law; (7) a Regulation establishing a European Civil Code. The establishment of an optional uniform contract law regime (Option 4) was therefore reasoned to be the most proportionate action as it would reduce transaction costs experienced by traders exporting to several Member States and give consumers more product choice at a lower price LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he Proposal provides for the establishment of a Common European Sales Law. It harmonises the national contract laws of the Member States not by requiring amendments to the pre-existing national contract law, but by creating within each Member State's national law a second contract law regime for contracts covered by its scope that is identical throughout the European Union and will exist alongside the pre-existing rules of national contract law. This ‘second regime’ is characterised by the following features: A contract law regime common to all Member States : the Common European Sales Law will be a 'second regime' of contract law that is identical in every Member State. It will be common for the whole of the EU. An optional regime : the choice of the Common European Sales Law will be voluntary. In line with the principle of freedom of contract, a trader is free to choose to offer a contract under this regime (opt-in system) or to remain with the existing national contract law. Focus on 'sales' contracts : the Common European Sales Law will introduce a self-standing and complete set of rules for sales transactions. This will in particular but not exclusively be useful for the online supply of goods. The Common European Sales Law could also be used, for example when buying music, films, software or applications that are downloaded from the internet. These products would be covered irrespective of whether they are stored on a tangible medium such as a CD or a DVD. Limited to cross-border contracts : the scope of the Common European Sales Law is focussed on cross-border situations where the problems of additional transactions costs and legal complexity arise. The Common European Sales Law is therefore targeted to where it is needed and is not available as a general substitute to existing national contract law. It is left to the discretion of Member States whether to give the regime a wider application. Member States thus have the choice to make the Common European Sales Law also available for domestic contracts – which could further reduce transaction costs for businesses active on the single market. Focus on B2C contracts and B2B contracts where at least one party is an SME : t he scope of the Common European Sales Law is focussed on aspects which pose real problems in cross-border transactions, i.e. business-to-consumer relations and business-to-business relations where at least one of the parties is an SME. Contracts concluded between private individuals (C2C) and contracts between traders where neither of the parties is an SME are not included. Identical set of consumer protection rules : the Regulation will establish for all the areas of contract law the same common level of consumer protection. A comprehensive set of contract law rules : t he Common European Sales Law includes rules that cover issues of contract law that are of practical relevance during the life-cycle of a cross-border contract. These issues fall within the areas of the rights and obligations of the parties and the remedies for non-performance, pre-contractual information duties, the conclusion of a contract (including formal requirements), the right of withdrawal and its consequences, avoidance resulting from a mistake, fraud or unfair exploitation, interpretation, the contents and effects of a contract, the assessment and consequences of unfairness of contract terms, restitution after avoidance and termination as well as prescription. It settles the sanctions available in case of the breach of the obligations and duties arising under its application. On the other hand, certain topics that are either very important for national laws or less relevant for cross-border contracts – such as rules on legal capacity, illegality/immorality or representation and the plurality of debtors and creditors – will not be addressed by the Common European Sales Law. These topics continue to be governed by the rules of the national law that is applicable under the Rome I Regulation. With an international dimension : the proposal also has an international vocation in that, in order to be applicable, it is sufficient that only one party is established in a Member State of the EU. This international vocation enables the Common European Sales Law to become a standard setter for international transactions in the area of sales contracts. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: after the adoption of the proposal, the Commission will set up a database for the exchange of information concerning final judgments referring to the Common European Sales Law or any other provision of the Regulation, as well as relevant judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The costs associated with this data-base are likely to grow as more final judgments become available. At the same time, the Commission will organise training sessions for legal practitioners using the Common European Sales Law. These costs are likely to decrease with time, as knowledge about how the Common European Sales Law works spreads."
1936EP9,"""""Transitional provisions in order to address the impact of COVID-19 crisis (Amendment of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628)""""",1.016,0.929,0.905,0.877,0.526,0.926,0.909,0.488,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 on emission limits and type-approval for non-road mobile machinery to address the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as ‘Stage V’, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT : Council Decision. CONTENT : the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco has been negotiated under a mandate received from the Council in December 2004. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, the text of the Morocco agreement was agreed ad referendum at the final negotiating round on 14 December 2005 on the occasion of the first Euromed conference of Transport Ministers held in Marrakech on 15 December 2005. The signature of the agreement is foreseen for the first half of 2006. Due to the advance status of the relationship between Morocco and the European Union, the Morocco agreement will result in the seamless integration of the Moroccan transport market into the single European market through a two-stage approach, always based on the three pillars of the aviation external policy: regulatory convergence (integration of the EC aviation regulations, participation in the Single European Sky) assorted with targeted technical assistance (through instruments such as the PAST), leading to the highest possible degree of market opening. This would result in an unrestricted commercial environment where operators are free to take commercial decisions, and where they operate under the highest standards in the areas of aviation safety, aviation security, environmental and consumer protection."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 establishes the Union fleet capacity policy for vessels used to carry goods on inland waterways in the Member States. In line with their fleet capacity policies, Member States with inland waterways linked to those of another Member State and total fleet tonnage of over 100 000 tonnes set up an Inland Waterway Fund (the ‘Reserve Fund’) on the basis of the aforementioned Regulation. The funds are administered by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned under their national legislation and with their own administrative resources. National organisations representing inland waterway carriers are involved in this administration. The reserve funds may be used in only two situations: In the event of a ‘serious market disturbance’ in the inland waterway transport market, as referred to in Directive 96/75/EC, the Commission may, at the request of a Member State, take suitable measures, in particular measures designed to prevent any new increase in the transport capacity on offer on the market in question. If unanimously requested by the organisations representing inland waterway transport. In such as case, any Member State may take the measures as referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. The reserve funds, consisting solely of financial contributions from the industry, have never been used. The EU-level representative organisations approached the Commission once, in 2003, to enquire about possibilities for using the funds. However, the envisaged measures were considered to be outside the scope of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999. The measures referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 only cover social aspects. However, these measures could be extended in particular to broaden the scope of training schemes, to strengthen the organisation of the sector and to create a context favourable to innovation and improved environmental performance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. The Commission consulted the representative organisations on 11 April 2013 on the reasons for the reserve funds never having been used, even though the sector was experiencing a decline, and on possible solutions. They confirmed that the limited scope of Article 8 was a barrier to triggering the use of the funds and stated that they would be in favour of expanding the scope of the Article. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 by measures aiming to: make it easier for inland waterway carriers leaving the industry to obtain an early retirement pension or to transfer to another economic activity; organise vocational training or retraining schemes for crew members leaving the industry; improve skills in inland navigation in order to safeguard the development and future of the profession; encourage owner-operators to join trade associations and strengthen the organisations representing inland waterway transport at Union level; encourage adaptation of vessels to technical progress in order to improve working conditions and promote safety; encourage innovation of vessels and their adaptation to technical progress as regards the environment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the European Union."
6050EP7,"""""Third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement""""",0.526,0.747,0.877,0.226,0.212,0.675,0.759,0.6,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to include some small Pacific islands on the positive list under the Regulation (Regulation, Annex II, list of nationals exempt from the obligation to be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTEXT: Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the so-called negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the so-called positive list). The determination of those third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating inter alia to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the European Union's external relations with third countries or territories. Consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. In view of the criteria of public order and illegal immigration, particular attention should also be paid to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries or territories concerned. As the criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed at regular intervals. This review aims in particular to: · ensure that the composition of the lists of third countries complies with the criteria set out in Recital 5 of the Regulation, in particular the illegal immigration and public policy criteria and the transfer of countries from one annex to another as appropriate; · ensure that in accordance with Article 77 (2) (a) of the TFEU, the Regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country national is to be subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement. As a result, a new amended version of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 is proposed to add a certain number of States to the positive or negative list of the Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been carried out. LEGAL BASE: article 77, par. 2, point a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in line with the approach taken within the framework of previous amendments to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, it is proposed to: · transfer some countries onto the positive list : t he imposition of the visa requirement on the nationals of Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati , Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu and Vanuatu is no longer justified. These countries do not present any risk of illegal immigration or a threat to public policy for the Union in accordance with the criteria set out in recital 5 of Regulation (EC) N° 539/2001. Consequently, nationals of those countries should be exempt from the visa requirement for stays of no more than three months in all and references to those countries should be transferred to Annex II. Exemption from the visa requirement should not come into force until bilateral agreements on visa waiver between the Union and the countries concerned have been concluded in order to ensure full reciprocity. · transfer the groups of “ British nationals ” onto the positive list : statistical data show that the groups of British nationals currently listed in point 3 of Annex I do not pose a risk in terms of irregular migration to the Schengen Area and that most of them live in islands of the Caribbean region which have strong links and similarities with neighbouring countries which are exempt from the visa obligation. These groups of British nationals should therefore be exempt from the visa requirement for stays of no more than three months in all and references to those groups should be transferred to Annex II. · update the negative list (Annex I) by the inclusion of South Sudan: on 9 July 2011, South Sudan declared its independence from Sudan, which is on the negative list. On 14 July 2011, the country was granted membership of the United Nations. Annex I should therefore be amended so as to include South Sudan. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment has no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates – a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges – are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."

6777EP7,"""""Markets in financial instruments and amendment of the EMIR Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories""""",0.877,0.832,0.895,0.484,0.303,0.795,0.815,0.086,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to adopt new rules for more sound, transparent and efficient EU financial markets (over the counter ‘OTC’ derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) (Directive 2004/39/EC), in force since November 2007, is a core pillar in EU financial market integration. It establishes a regulatory framework for the provision of investment services in financial instruments (such as brokerage, advice, dealing, portfolio management, underwriting etc.) by banks and investment firms and for the operation of regulated markets by market operators. It also establishes the powers and duties of national competent authorities in relation to these activities. The result after 3.5 years in force is more competition between venues in the trading of financial instruments, and more choice for investors in terms of service providers and available financial instruments, progress which has been compounded by technological advances. Overall, transaction costs have decreased and integration has increased. However, some problems have surfaced: the benefits from this increased competition have not flowed equally to all market participants and have not always been passed on to the end investors, retail or wholesale; the market fragmentation implied by competition has also made the trading environment more complex; market and technological developments have outpaced various provisions in MiFID; the financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the regulation of instruments other than shares, traded mostly between professional investors. In line with the recommendations from the de Larosière group and the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of June 2009, the revision of MiFID therefore constitutes an integral part of the reforms aimed at establishing a safer, sounder, more transparent and more responsible financial system. It is also an essential vehicle for delivering on the G20  commitment to tackle less regulated and more opaque parts of the financial system, and improve the organisation, transparency and oversight of various market segments, especially in those instruments traded mostly over the counter (OTC), complementing the legislative proposal on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. The proposal amending MiFID is divided in two: this draft Regulation on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation [EMIR] on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories; the proposed Directive on markets in financial instruments, repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were assessed against different criteria: transparency of market operations for regulators and market participants, investor protection and confidence, level playing field for market venues and trading systems in the EU, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the review of MiFID is estimated to generate one-off compliance costs of between EUR 512 and EUR 732 million and ongoing costs of between EUR 312 and EUR 586 million. This represents one-off and ongoing cost impacts of respectively 0.10% to 0.15% and 0.06% to 0.12% of total operating spending of the EU banking sector. This is far less than the costs imposed at the time of the introduction of MiFID. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation sets out requirements in relation to the disclosure of trade transparency data to the public and transaction data to competent authorities, removing barriers to non-discriminatory access to clearing facilities, the mandatory trading of derivatives on organised venues, specific supervisory actions regarding financial instruments and positions in derivatives, and the provision of services by third-country firms without a branch. A central aim of the proposal is to ensure that all organised trading is conducted on regulated trading venues: regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and organised trading facilities (OTFs). Identical pre and post trade transparency requirements will apply to all of these venues. The transparency requirements will be calibrated for different types of instruments, notably equity, bonds, and derivatives, and for different types of trading, notably order book and quote driven systems. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Extension of transparency rules to equity like instruments and actionable indications of interests : MiFID has established transparency rules, both pre and post trade that apply to shares admitted to trading on regulated markets, including when those shares are traded on an MTF or over the counter (OTC). The proposed provisions first extend the transparency rules applicable by these shares to equity like instruments such as depository receipts, exchange-traded funds, certificates and other similar financial instruments issues by companies. The extension of the transparency requirements will also cover actionable indications of interests (IOIs). Increased consistency in the application of waivers to pre trade transparency for equities markets : the proposed provisions will oblige the competent authorities to inform ESMA about the use of the waivers in their markets and ESMA will issue an opinion on the compatibility of the waiver with the requirements established in this Regulation and prospective delegated acts. Extension of transparency rules to bonds, structured finance products and derivatives : the proposal extends the principles of transparency rules up to now only applicable to equity markets to bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives. Increased and more efficient data consolidation : the proposed provisions will contribute to reducing the cost of data by requesting trading venues, that is regulated markets, MTFs or OTFs to make post trade information available free of charge 15 minutes after the execution of the transaction, to offer pre- and post-trade data separately, and by giving the possibility to the Commission to clarify by delegated acts what constitutes a reasonable commercial basis. The proposal also requires investment firms to make public trades executed outside trading venues via Approved Publication Arrangements which will themselves be regulated in the Directive. This should significantly improve the quality of OTC data and consequently facilitate its consolidation. Transparency for investment firms trading OTC including systematic internalisers : the existing transparency rules for systematic internalisers will apply to shares and equity-like instruments, while new provisions would be introduced for bonds, structured finance products admitted to trading on a regulated market or for which a prospectus has been published, emission allowances and derivatives which are clearing-eligible or are admitted to trading on a regulated market or are traded on an MTF or an OTF. Transaction reporting : all transactions in financial instruments will need to be reported to competent authorities, except for transactions in financial instruments which are not traded in an organised way and are not susceptible to market abuse and cannot be used for abusive purposes. Competent authorities will have full access to records at all stages in the order execution process, from the initial decision to trade, through to its execution. Trading of derivatives : consistent with the requirements already proposed by the Commission (EMIR) to increase central clearing of OTC derivatives, the proposed provisions in this Regulation will require trading in suitably developed derivatives to occur only on eligible platforms, that is regulated markets, MTFs or OTFs. This obligation will be imposed on both financial and non financial counterparties exceeding the clearing threshold in EMIR. Non-discriminatory clearing access : the proposed provisions will prohibit discriminatory practices and prevent barriers that may prevent competition for the clearing of financial instruments. Supervision of products and positions : the proposed amendments will greatly increase the supervision of products and services by introducing the possibilities on the one hand, for competent authorities to set permanent bans on financial products or activities or practices with coordination by ESMA, and on the other hand, for ESMA to also temporarily ban products, practices and services. The proposed provisions in the Regulation introduce a role for ESMA to coordinate the measures taken at national level and specific powers to manage or limit positions for market participants. Provision of investment services by third country firms without a branch : the proposal creates a harmonised framework for granting access to EU markets for firms and market operators based in third countries in order to overcome the current fragmentation into national third country regimes and to ensure a level playing field for all financial services actors in the EU territory. The proposal introduces a regime based on a preliminary equivalence assessment of third country jurisdictions by the Commission. Third country firms from third countries for which an equivalence decision has been adopted would be able to request to provide services in the Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to task allocated to ESMA. Total appropriations are estimated at EUR 1 744 million from 2013 to 2015. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in their inter-institutional agreement on better law making that Community law should be updated and condensed by repealing acts which are no longer applied.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. CONTENT: the Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/352 which establishes a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports. It is proposed that the new transitional provision shall provide Member States with the option to allow managing bodies of a port or competent authorities to decide whether to:  waive (condone, i.e. not require the payment at all); or suspend (freeze or put on hold the payment for a certain time period); or reduce (decrease the payment); or defer (require the payment at a later point in time) the payment of the port infrastructure charges. As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. This new provision also stipulates that the managing body of a port or the competent authority shall ensure that port users and the representatives or associations of port users are informed accordingly. The time limit of two months referred to in Regulation (EU) 2017/352 shall not apply."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Decision (EU) 2017/1324 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for the participation of the Union in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The strategic objective of PRIMA is to build research and innovation capacities and to develop knowledge and common innovative solutions for agro-food systems in order to make them sustainable, as well as for an integrated water supply and management in the Mediterranean area. PRIMA will be jointly undertaken by a number of Member States and third countries with a high level of commitment to scientific, management and financial integration and under the same terms and conditions. Jordan expressed its wish to join PRIMA as a Participating State and pledged to commit a financial contribution of EUR 30 million to the initiative. The negotiations started on 26 June 2017 and were successfully completed on 10 July 2017, when the text of the draft Agreement was initialled by representatives from each of the future Parties. In order to ensure that Jordan participates in PRIMA on an equal footing with Member States and third countries associated to Horizon 2020, an International Agreement with the Union is required to extend the scope of the legal regime established by Decision (EU) 2017/1324 to Jordan. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council conclude the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Jordan setting out the terms and conditions for participation of Jordan in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The present initiative will allow Jordan to become a Participating State in PRIMA, and thus engaged on an equal footing with Member States and third countries associated to Horizon 2020. Jordanian legal entities would be automatically eligible to apply for EU funding in projects funded from the EU budget. In order to ensure the protection of Union financial interests, particularly the powers of the Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the Court of Auditors and the PRIMA Implementation Structure (PRIMA-IS) to carry out audits and investigations, the Agreement and obliges the Parties to provide all necessary assistance to ensure their implementation and agree on detailed arrangements for assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 82 800 for the period 2018-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the common rules for protection against dumped and subsidised imports from countries which are not members of the European Union are contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community respectively. The Regulations were initially adopted in 1995 following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Given that a number of amendments were made to them since then, the Council decided in 2009 to codify the regulations in the interest of clarity and rationality. Following a review launched by the Commission in 2011, it was considered that certain provisions of the Regulations should be amended in order to improve transparency and predictability, provide for effective measures to fight against retaliation, improve effectiveness and enforcement and optimise review practice. In addition, certain practices that in recent years have been applied in the context of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations should be included in the Regulations. This legislative proposal is issued in parallel with a Communication on the Modernisation of Trade Defence Instruments: Adapting trade defence instruments to the current needs of the European economy and draft guidelines on four important elements Union interest, injury margin, analogue country and expiry reviews of the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments (TDIs). The draft guidelines public consultation before they are adopted by the Commission. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: taking into account the results of a public consultation, an evaluation study and the Commission's extensive practice in the use of the instruments, an impact assessment was carried out in autumn 2012. The impact assessment report identified problems in the functioning of the trade defence instruments and proposed various solutions. The preferred solutions form the basis for this proposal. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under its legislative proposal, the Commission introduces what it considers to be a series of improvements to the current rules in relation to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures which may be summarised under five main headings: Enhanced transparency and predictability: interested parties, such as importers or users, would be informed two weeks in advance of the imposition of provisional measures that such measures are going to be imposed. Parties would also be given a guarantee that the measures will not be imposed within this two-week period. A summary of the basis on which it is intended to impose the measures would be sent to interested parties and they would have the opportunity to comment on the calculation of the dumping and injury margins. Calculation errors could then be corrected in advance of the imposition of measures. Furthermore, when it is decided not to impose provisional measures but to continue the investigation, interested parties would be informed of the intention not to impose such measures two weeks in advance of the ultimate date for imposition. Threats of retaliation against Union producers: in order to ensure effective measures to fight against retaliation, the proposal would enable Union producers to rely on the Regulations without fear of retaliation by third parties. Existing provisions, under special circumstances, provide for the initiation of an investigation without having received a complaint (“ex-officio”), where sufficient evidence of the existence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, injury and causal link exists. Such special circumstances should include threat of retaliation. Furthermore, when investigations are opened on an ex-officio basis, it is proposed to oblige Union producers to cooperate in the proceeding. Effectiveness of the instruments: according to the Commission, third countries increasingly interfere in trade of raw materials with a view to keeping raw materials in those countries for the benefit of domestic downstream users, for instance by imposing export taxes or operating dual pricing schemes. As a result, the costs of raw materials do not result from the operation of normal market forces reflecting supply and demand for a given raw material. Such interference creates additional distortions of trade. As a consequence, Union producers are not only harmed by dumping, but suffer, compared to downstream producers from third countries engaged in such practices, additional distortions of trade. In order to protect trade adequately, it is proposed to remove the lesser duty rule in cases of circumvention, or where structural raw material distortions have been found to exist, and subsidisation. Reviews: in order to optimise the review practice, it is proposed that duties collected during the investigation should be reimbursed to importers, where measures are not extended after the conclusion of an expiry review investigation. This is considered appropriate given that the conditions required for the continuation of the measures have not been found to exist during the investigation period. Lastly, there are a number of areas where it is proposed to codify certain practices which stem from ECJ or WTO rulings that have been handed down in recent years. These concern (i) the definition of Union industry, (ii) the consequences for exporting producers found not to be dumping or to be dumping at de-minimis levels in an original investigation, (iii) dealing with changed circumstances in a review investigation, (iv) the treatment of related companies in anti-circumvention investigations, (v) the conditions for the registration of imports, and (vi) the basis for choosing a sample of Union producers. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has implications for the Union budget. The non-application of the lesser duty rule under certain circumstances will, in some cases, lead to higher duty levels and is thus revenue enhancing. The reimbursement of duties in cases where measures are terminated after an expiry review represents an expense for the Union budget. Quantification is, however, very difficult since any revenue or expense depends on the circumstances of each individual case. The cost of the upgrading of the SME helpdesk would amount to EUR 130 000 per year."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the effective return of third country nationals who do not fulfil or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in the Member State of the Union is an essential part of a comprehensive approach to ensure the proper functioning of the EU migration policies and for maintaining public trust in the Union migration system. However, the EU system to return irregular migrants is not sufficiently effective. The lack of valid travel documents issued by the country of destination of the returnee is one of the main obstacles to successful return. At present, Member States may issue a substitute document for those illegally staying third-country nationals who do not possess a valid travel document. However, its recognition by third countries is low, including because of its unsatisfactory security features and standards. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish a dedicated European travel document for the return of third-country nationals subject to a return decision. It aims to: harmonise the format and technical specifications of the European travel document for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals in order to ensure higher technical and security standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification; facilitate recognition of this document by third countries for the purpose of return and readmission; increase flexibility for the authorities of third countries in terms of managing documents in order for them to accelerate the administrative procedures for return and reduce the administrative burden on competent consular authorities; set the rules relating to the fees for issuing the European travel document for return, which shall be free of charge for the third-country national given that it shall only be valid for a single journey; contribute to reducing the period during which returnees awaiting removal are kept in administrative detention."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASIS: Article 19(2), second paragraph, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. (TFUE); first paragraph of Article 254, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 and the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU; Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. CONTENT: the Court of Justice submits to the European Union legislature draft amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice and its Annex I. This single text incorporates separate proposals in respect of each of the three jurisdictions which comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union. 1) Proposals relating to the Court of Justice : the Court considers it desirable to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice and to amend the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber. The current structure of the Grand Chamber and the rules determining how it operates - a quorum of nine Judges together with the participation in every case of the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges - are the product of amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003. Since that date, there have been a number of changes affecting the work of the Court: (i) the accession of 12 new Member States; (ii) the transition from two to three Chambers of five Judges in May 2004 and to four Chambers of five Judges in October 2006; (iii) the introduction of the urgent preliminary ruling procedure in March 2008; and (iv) the introduction of the review procedure following the establishment of the Civil Service Tribunal. At present, the President of the Court and the Presidents of the Chambers of five Judges have a very heavy workload, whereas other Judges sit in relatively few cases assigned to the Grand Chamber. broader participation by the Judges in cases assigned to the Grand Chamber , allowing them to sit far more frequently than at present (in almost half, instead of a third, of all cases). That would be achieved by the amendment of Articles 16 and 17 of the Statute so as to increase to 15 the number of Judges constituting the Grand Chamber and to end the automatic participation of the Presidents of Chambers of five Judges in Grand Chamber cases. Corresponding adjustments must be made to the rules relating to the quorum of the Grand Chamber and of the full Court; the establishment of the office of Vice-President: the latter would sit, like the President, in every case assigned to the Grand Chamber. The permanent presence of two persons, together with the more frequent participation of the other Judges in the work of the Grand Chamber, would ensure that its case-law is consistent. In addition to sitting in every Grand Chamber case, the Vice-President would also assist the President of the Court in his duties. 2) Proposals relating to the General Court : for several years now, the number of cases disposed of by the General Court has been lower than the number of new cases, so that the number of pending cases is rising constantly. At the end of 2010, there were 1 300 cases pending, whereas, in the same year, 527 cases were disposed of. In addition to the number of cases currently pending, the likely increase in the number of cases brought before the General Court must be taken into account: there was an increase of 65% between 2000 and 2010. In addition to those areas of litigation, further litigation will be generated by the application of the numerous regulations establishing European Union agencies, in particular the REACH Regulation The current increase in workload is due to (i) the devolution of jurisdiction, since 2004, to rule on certain classes of action or proceedings brought by the Member States; (ii) to the increase in litigation following the 2004 and 2007 accessions; (iii) to the litigation engendered by the increase, resulting from greater European integration, in the number and variety of legislative and regulatory acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU; and (iv) to the growth of litigation relating to Community trade mark applications. The Court of Justice believes that a structural solution is urgently required. The Treaties offer two possible routes to reform: (a) to establish specialised courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine direct actions in a specific area, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 257 TFEU. The field of intellectual property has been mooted in that regard; (b) increasing the number of Judges of the General Court by means of an amendment to Article 48 of the Statute in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU. Having weighed up the two options at length, the Court of Justice has come to the conclusion that an increase in the number of Judges is clearly preferable to the establishment of a specialised court in the field of intellectual property. Its reasons relate to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the measure envisaged and the consistency of European Union law. The Court of Justice therefore considers that an increase in the number of Judges by at least 12, bringing the number of General Court Judges to 39, is necessary. 3) Proposals relating to the Civil Service Tribunal : the European Union Civil Service Tribunal comprises seven Judges. Owing to that limited composition, the functioning of the Tribunal can be seriously affected if one of its members, for an extended period of time, is prevented on medical grounds from performing his duties, without however suffering from disablement within the meaning of Article 10 of Council Regulation No 422/67/EEC, No 5/67/Euratom. In order to ensure that the Civil Service Tribunal is not placed in a situation of difficulty such as to prevent it from carrying out its judicial functions, it is proposed to amend Article 62c of the Statute of the Court by providing, in general terms, for the possibility of attaching temporary Judges to the specialised courts. The rules governing the appointment of temporary Judges, their rights and obligations, the conditions under which they are to perform their duties and the circumstances in which they will cease to perform those duties are laid down in a separate draft regulation, which would supplement Annex I to the Statute."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on shipments of waste (WSR) lays down requirements for shipments of waste both within the Union and between the Member States and third countries, in order to protect the environment. However, gaps have been identified in the enforcement and inspections carried out by the competent authorities in Member States due to, inter alia, a lack of clear provisions in the Regulation on these matters. Illegal waste shipments are a serious and frequent problem. In 2011 a study estimated the tonnage of illegal shipments within and out of the EU to be 2.8 million tonnes per year. The most problematic illegal waste shipments are those concerning hazardous waste and waste which is illegally sent for dumping or sub-standard treatment. The export bans for hazardous waste and waste for disposal under the WSR are often circumvented. The joint inspections carried out by the ""network for the implementation and enforcement of environmental law, trans-frontier shipments of waste-cluster"" (IMPEL-tfs) revealed very high rates of non-compliance with the WSR due to illegal waste shipments. During the period October 2008-November 2010, the overall non-compliance rate can be estimated to be 25%. Council conclusions of 3 June 2010 invited the Commission, inter alia, to consider strengthening EU requirements on inspections and spot checks carried out under the WSR. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission’s impact assessment examined several options to strengthen inspections and enforcement of the WSR. The assessment concluded that a combination of EU legislative requirements and guidance would be the most effective option to address the problems related to illegal waste shipments. This option would also have the lowest net costs and the most positive economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 aims to help ensure more uniform implementation of the WSR through establishing minimum inspection requirements throughout the EU with a focus on problematic waste streams. More specifically, the proposal seeks to: strengthen the provisions regarding the enforcement of rules and inspections covered by Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 with a view to ensuring regular and consistent planning of inspections . Planning should include a number of key elements, including risk assessments, strategies, objectives, priorities, numbers and types of planned inspections, assignment of tasks, means of cooperation between authorities and provisions on training of inspectors; introduce the possibility for competent authorities in Member States to require evidence from waste exporters in order to check the legality of shipments . Such evidence may concern whether the substance or object is ""waste"" or not, whether the shipment is destined for recovery or disposal, or the nature of the specific waste treatment methods and standards applied by the facility in the country of destination. The Commission may adopt guidelines for the enforcement of the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no incidence on the EU’s budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
6633EP7,"""""European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme""""",0.93,0.861,0.965,0.613,0.455,0.892,0.877,0.686,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to enable the participation of the Union in a second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme jointly undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established in 2003 in response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases - HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis - and to the EU’s commitment to achieving the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The first EDCTP programme (EDCTP-I 2003-2012) is now beyond its active funding period. EDCTP-I had major achievements and has so far developed eight improved medical treatments, in particular for new-borns, children or pregnant/lactating women suffering from HIV/AIDS or malaria. It has resulted in the launch of the first four African Regional Networks of Excellence promoting South-South cooperation on clinical research and more than 400 African researchers have been trained. It has also contributed to establishing the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry and the African Vaccine Regulators Forum. Despite the results and impact of EDCTP so far, the health and socio-economic burden of poverty-related diseases persists and hinders the sustainable development of developing countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa. More than one billion people, including 400 million children, are suffering from one or more poverty-related diseases, including neglected infectious diseases such as sleeping sickness and worm infections. HIV/AIDS alone kills an estimated 2 million people, while malaria and tuberculosis together kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually. Following the recommendations from the independent interim evaluation of EDCTP-I, the Belgian EU Council Presidency proposed, in November 2010, the launch of a second EDCTP joint programme (EDCTP-2) with at least ten years duration (2014-2024). On 15 June 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in which it ‘asks the Commission, the Member States and developing countries to address MDG 5 (on improving maternal health), MDG 4 (on child mortality) and MDG 6 (on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) in a coherent and holistic way’. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the external interim evaluations of the EDCTP-I and the impact assessment of the future EDCTP-2 programme call for the programme to be continued but with the next programme lasting 10 years and covering a scope that extends to other poverty-related diseases (beyond HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria) and to all phases of clinical development. The geographical focus should continue to be on sub-Saharan Africa. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 185 and Article 188(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a decision concerns the participation of the Union in a second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme (EDCTP-2) jointly undertaken by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as Switzerland and Norway. EDCTP2 shall contribute to the reduction of the social and economic burden of poverty-related diseases in developing countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, by accelerating the clinical development of effective, safe and affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases, in partnership with sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP-2 seeks to achieve the following specific objectives: an increased number of new or improved medical interventions for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other poverty-related diseases, and by the end of the programme to have delivered (i) at least one new medical intervention; (ii) to have issued at least 30 guidelines for improved or extended use of existing medical interventions; and (iii) to have progressed the clinical development of at least 20 candidate medical interventions; strengthened cooperation with sub-Saharan African countries, in particular on building their capacity for conducting clinical trials; better coordination, alignment and integration of relevant national programmes to increase the cost-effectiveness of European public investments; extended international cooperation with other public and private funders; an increased impact due to effective cooperation with relevant European Union initiatives, including its development assistance. EDCTP-2 has been conceived to complement the actions implemented under the European Development Funds and the Development Cooperation Instruments, and to respond to the Union’s commitment to the 2012 Rio+20 conference conclusions on developing and achieving internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Union contribution shall be up to EUR 683 million at current prices including EFTA contribution. The envelope is in current prices. The Union contribution shall be made from the ‘Health, demographic change and wellbeing’ challenge, DG Research & Innovation envelope, as part of the implementation of Horizon 2020 – The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The maximum amount of Union contribution for administrative costs is up to EUR 41 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in the years preceding the crisis, low financing costs fuelled misallocation of resources, often to less productive uses, feeding unsustainable levels of consumption, housing bubbles and accumulation of external and internal debt in some Member States. The emergence of large macroeconomic imbalances, including wide and persistent divergences in competitiveness trends, proved highly damaging to the European Union, and in particular to the euro, when the crisis struck. It is therefore important to develop a new structured procedure for prevention and correction of adverse macroeconomic imbalances in every Member State. In its Communication and report on « EMU@10: successes and challenges after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union ” the Commission stressed, in particular, the need to broaden economic surveillance in order to detect and address macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage. The Europe 2020 strategy calls for the development of a specific policy framework for the euro area to tackle broader macroeconomic imbalances. Overall, the Task Force on economic governance, chaired by the President of the European Council, agreed that macroeconomic surveillance should function alongside the budget surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact. This proposal is part of legislative package comprising six texts which seeks to strengthen the pact by improving its provisions in the light of experience, not least of the crisis: 1) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1466/97); 2) A Regulation amending the legislative underpinning of the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact (Regulation 1467/97); 3) A Regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area; 4) A new Council Directive on requirements for the budgetary framework of the Member States; 5) A new Regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; 6) A Regulation on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASE: Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission is proposing a mechanism for the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances which is made up of two draft proposals for regulations. The first proposal sketches out the excessive imbalance procedure (EIP), while this proposal focuses on the associated enforcement measures. The second proposal specifies that if a Member State repeatedly fails to act on Council recommendations to address excessive macroeconomic imbalances, it will have to pay a yearly fine equal to 0.1% of its GDP. As a rule, the Commission will propose the maximum amount of the fine provided for and this proposal will be considered adopted, unless the Council decides to the contrary by qualified majority within ten days of the Commission adopting its proposal (“reverse voting”). The Council may amend the Commission proposal by acting unanimously. The Council may decide, on the basis of a Commission proposal, to cancel or to reduce the fine. The Commission could make a proposal to this end following assessment of a reasoned request by the Member State and this would reverse the burden of proof for application of the sanction. Furthermore, the Commission could also make a proposal to the same end on the basis of exceptional economic circumstances. Council decisions concerning such fines will be made only by the members representing Member States whose currency is the euro. The vote of the member of the Council representing the Member State concerned by the decisions will not be taken into account. The fines provided for in this proposal for a regulation constitute other revenue, as referred to in Article 311 of the Treaty. In line with the practice established in the corrective part of the SGP (Regulation 'EC) No 1467/97), this revenue will be distributed between Member States whose currency is the euro and which are not involved in an excessive imbalance procedure and not involved in an excessive deficit procedure, in proportion to their share of the total GNI of the eligible Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years."

Extension of the transitional arrangement""""",0.984,0.956,0.946,0.438,0.491,0.926,0.896,0.122,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to extend the transitional arrangement for management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and non-UCITS. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 enables retail investors to better understand and compare packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and make better-informed investment decisions. To meet its objectives, Regulation requires PRIIPs manufacturers to comply with a uniform set of product disclosure requirements and provide retail investors with a key information document (KID) on each PRIIP they offer. Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS within the meaning of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a KID. This arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 supplements Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 by laying down regulatory technical standards with regard to the presentation, content and standard format of the key information document. The Commission adopted Commission Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 to make it easier for management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS. However, the date of application of Delegated Regulation has been set on 1 July 2022 to give those management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and thus for the obligation to draw up a key information document. This proposal is accompanied by a proposal amending Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the use of key information documents by management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and implement the other proposed measure (which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653). Under this proposal, Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 would apply to management companies, investment companies and persons advising on or selling units of UCITS and non-UCITS on the same date as the amendments to Directive 2009/65/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653, i.e. from 1 July 2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Ukraine continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. An Association Agreement between the Union and Ukraine, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), entered into force on 1 September 2017. Since spring 2014, Ukraine has embarked on an ambitious reform programme aiming to stabilise its economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens. In addition to its political support, the Union pledged over EUR 11 billion financial package in March 2014 to support economic stabilisation and reform implementation in Ukraine, including 1.6 billion of macro-financial assistance pursuant to Council Decision 2002/639/EC, Decision No 646/2010/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and pursuant to Council Decision 2014/215/EU. In view of Ukraine's substantial external financing needs, an additional EUR 1.8 billion of macro-financial assistance (MFA) was made available to the country in April 2015 pursuant to Decision (EU) 2015/601 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Since May 2014, Ukraine has received EUR 2.81 billion of macro-financial assistance from the Union , including EUR 1.2 billion out of the EUR 1.8 billion available under Decision (EU) 2015/601. Ukraine fulfilled 17 of the 21 policy commitments attached to the third tranche of EUR 600 million that could have been made available to Ukraine under the third MFA operation. Although four measures were not implemented by the time the availability period of the assistance expired in January 2018. Under these circumstances, the Commission was not in a position to disburse the last tranche under the third MFA operation. Given that a residual external financing gap remains in Ukraine’s balance of payments over and above the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Ukraine is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Ukraine’s request for support to its economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. The Union’s macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Ukraine, supplementing resources made available under the IMF’s financial arrangement. CONTENT: under the proposed Decision, the European Union shall make MFA available to Ukraine for a total amount of up to EUR 1 billion, provided in the form of medium- to long-term loans. The objective of the proposed AMF is to: help Ukraine cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2018-2019 , reducing the economy’s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities; provide incentives to step up Ukraine's reform efforts by agreeing with the Ukrainian authorities a Memorandum of Understanding setting out an appropriate package of measures supporting economic adjustment and structural reforms. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments. Provided the policy measures attached to each tranche have been implemented in a timely manner, the first instalment is expected to be disbursed in the second half of 2018, while the second instalment could be released in the first half of 2019. All disbursements under the proposed programme, including the first, would be conditional on the implementation of reform measures designed to address vulnerabilities identified in the Ukrainian economy. These reforms, established in a Memorandum of Understanding, will have to take into account the measures of the previous MFA operation that have not yet been implemented, namely the establishment of a system for verifying asset declarations of public officials and a verification of data to be provided by companies on their beneficial owners. The issue wood export ban shall also be examined. The MFA may only be completed if major reforms in the fight against corruption and governance are well implemented. In addition, the Memorandum for the new programme will also include other measures to be implemented by Ukraine in order to receive the first and second disbursement. These will comprise actions in the area of public finance management. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of loans and should be financed through borrowing operations that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed into the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (“Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund”). Assuming that the first loan disbursements will be made in 2018 for a total amount of EUR 500 million and the second loan disbursement in 2019 for the amount of EUR 500 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the budgets for 2020 (EUR 45 million) and 2021 (EUR 45 million). The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 90.997 million for the period 2017-2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers' interests to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market. Applicable as of 29th December 2005, the Regulation achieves this aim by creating an enforcement cooperation network between public enforcement authorities and thus increasing consumer confidence in taking up cross-border offers, and preventing sellers and suppliers from evading enforcement to the competitive detriment of law-abiding sellers and suppliers. The network established by the Regulation monitors and enforces legislation which protects consumers' interests. The legislation which falls into the scope of the network is listed in the Annex referred to in Article 3(a) of the Regulation. The amendment of the Annex will consist of the removal from the Annex of legislation which is not relevant for consumer protection cooperation and the updating of references to old legislation which is no longer in force by references to the current legislation in the field of consumer protection. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the proposed amending Regulation does not have significant economic, social and environmental impacts, an impact assessment is not necessary. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the overall goals of the proposed amending regulation are to ensure that Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws remains efficient and continues to guarantee that there is no discrimination between intra-EU and national transactions as to the effectiveness with which infringements are pursued by the competent national authorities. To achieve these goals, the proposed amending regulation has as its objective to update the contents of the Annex to the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation to reflect recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection. The proposal deletes obsolete legislation referred to in the Annex and replaces them with references to legislation currently in force.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the need to rapidly achieve the Banking Union to ensure financial stability and growth in the euro area as well as throughout the single market was underlined by the Commission in its communications entitled “A Roadmap towards a Banking Union” (September 2012) and “A blueprint for a deep and genuine economic and monetary union: Launching a European Debate” (November 2012). In March 2013, the European Council committed to complete the Banking Union via the following steps. the remaining legislative procedures to set up the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) conferring powers on the ECB to supervise Euro Area banks should be concluded as a priority; agreement should be reached in the summer of 2013 on how the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could, following the establishment of the SSM and a review of bank balance sheets including the definition of “legacy assets”, recapitalise banks directly; likewise, in summer 2013, agreement should be reached on the Commission’s proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms; lastly, the Commission’s proposal for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) together with appropriate and effective backstop arrangements should be examined as a matter of priority with the intention of adopting them during the current parliamentary cycle. It was agreed that the Banking Union would cover all Euro Area Member States and those non-Euro Area Member States that choose to join. As recognised by the European Council, in the Banking Union, bank supervision and resolution need to be exercised by the same level of authority. The same EU-wide single rulebook of prudential requirements 6 and rules on bank resolution will apply within the Banking Union and in all other Member States. The swift agreement on a Single Supervisory Mechanism in April 2012 has laid the ground for a Banking Union, as integral part of the Economic and Monetary Union. The Single Supervisory Mechanism is set to enter into force in mid-2014. The ECB will assume ultimate responsibility for the supervision of all Euro Area banks. The Single Resolution Mechanism meanwhile should commence operations in January 2015, when the Directive which will provide the rulebook governing bank resolution across the internal market is set to enter into force IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has taken into account the analysis carried out in the Impact Assessment conducted for the adoption of the proposal for Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms which assessed operational and legal aspects relevant to the establishment of a single resolution mechanism (SRM). With regard to the ability of the SRM to produce efficient decisions, it is considered that a central decision-making level will contribute to minimizing the costs of resolution both since it can attain significant advantages in terms of economies of scale over a network, and because it is instrumental to the enforceability and optimality of the resolution decision. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to preserve the integrity of the Member States banking markets participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) by the putting in place of a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to deal with failing banks. The SRM would permit the application of uniform rules to any bank in difficulty in a participating Member State and to proceed effectively towards the resolution of bank failures in such a way as to minimise the cost for the taxpayer and for the real economy. Structure of the SRM: the composition of the SRM ensures that its decision-making structures are legally sound and effective, including in times of crisis. The decision-making structures of the Single Resolution Mechanism include the Single Resolution Board, the national resolution authorities of participating Member States and the European Commission. The tasks of the SRM are shared between Single Resolution Board and the national resolution authorities. The European Commission will participate in the SRM only in so far as needed to perform specific tasks provided for in this proposed Regulation and in relation to State aid scrutiny under the Treaty. Resolution - operation and procedure: to ensure that all participating Member States have full confidence in the quality and impartiality of the bank resolution process, resolution decisions will be prepared and monitored centrally by a Single Resolution Board to ensure a coherent and uniform approach is applied. The objective of resolution is to ensure the continuity of the bank’s critical functions, to protect financial stability, to minimise reliance on taxpayers’ money, and to protect depositors. Resolution is triggered by means of the following process : the ECB, as bank supervisor, notifies that a bank is failing to Commission, to the Resolution Board and to the relevant national authorities and ministries; the Resolution Board assesses if there is a systemic threat and no private sector solution and, if so, the Resolution Board recommends to the Commission to initiate resolution; on the basis of the Resolution Board’s recommendations, or of its own initiative, the Commission will have the power to initiate the resolution procedure; in this case, it would also indicate to the Resolution Board the framework of the resolution tools that will be applied in each case and on the use of the Fund; the national resolution authorities execute the resolution measures decided by the Board according to the national law. If the national resolution authorities do not comply with the decisions of the Board, the Board has the power to supersede the national resolution authorities and address certain decisions for the implementation of the resolution measures directly to the banks. Single Bank Resolution Fund: to support the resolution process and enhance its effectiveness, the proposed Regulation establishes a Single Bank Resolution Fund. This Fund will be able to pool significant resources from bank contributions and therefore protect taxpayers more effectively than national funds, while at the same time providing a level playing field for banks across participating Member States. The primary objective of the Single Resolution Fund is to ensure financial stability, rather than to absorb losses or provide capital to an institution under resolution. The Fund should not be considered as a bailout fund. On the basis of 2011 data on banks and an estimated amount of covered deposits held in banks in the euro-area, the 1% target level for the Single Resolution Fund would correspond to around EUR 55 billion. A transitional period of 10 years is foreseen before the Fund reaches its full target level. If no disbursements are made from the Fund during the initial build-up phase, the banking industry would annually contribute around one tenth of the target amount or in absolute terms around EUR 5.5 billion. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Resolution Board will be fully financed from contributions from the financial institutions. Around 6 000 Eurozone banks, in addition to their annual contributions to the Single Bank Resolution Fund, will pay a fixed pro rata of this amount to fully cover the Boards’ budgetary expenses. However, there will be some minor implications on the Union’s budget in the start-up phase of the Board. The incidence on the Commission’s administrative expenditure is estimated at EUR 10.575 million for the period 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to prepare for the possibility that the United Kingdom could withdraw from the Union without an agreement on 30 March 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/501 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) 2019/502 of the European Parliament and of the Council were adopted to ensure basic road freight and road passenger and basic air connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom. Regulation (EU) 2019/501 and Regulation (EU) 2019/502 shall cease to apply on 31 December 2019 and 30 March 2020 respectively. Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. In order to address the impact of the new timeline for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union, the period of application of those Regulations should be extended, taking into account the core principles underlying contingency measures and their originally intended periods of application. CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the period of validity of Regulations (EU) 2019/501 and (EU) 2019/502 by seven months, which corresponds to the duration of the extension of the period referred to in Article 50(3) of the TEU. Therefore, it is proposed that Regulation (EU) 2019/501 should cease to apply on 31 July 2020 rather than on 31 December 2019. In addition, in order to ensure that the option provided for in Article 2(3)(d) of Regulation (EU) 2019/501 is available for a meaning period of the same order as that initially provided for, it is necessary to define the period during which cabotage services in the field of road passenger transport may be provided in the border region of Ireland as a six-month period starting from the date of application of that Regulation. This rule should replace the current reference to the date of cessation of application of 30 September 2019. As regards Regulation (EU) 2019/502, the proposal sets 24 October 2020, the end of IATA's 2020 summer season, as the date of cessation of its application. The 12-month period of application initially envisaged would thus be preserved."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. The Commission has consistently made clear that protecting Union citizens in the United Kingdom, as well as United Kingdom nationals in the European Union is a priority. This will require Member States to take a generous approach to the United Kingdom nationals who are already resident in their territory. The expectation is that the United Kingdom acts in the same manner. As of the withdrawal date, in the event there is no withdrawal agreement concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom, Union law on social security coordination will no longer apply in the relations between the Union and the United Kingdom. This means that social security entitlements will not be guaranteed for Union citizens who are, or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States and in situations involving the United Kingdom (e.g. they worked or resided there while the United Kingdom was a Member State of the Union) and also of the United Kingdom nationals who are or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States. This proposal is necessary to protect the social security entitlements of the persons concerned with regard to facts or events occurring and periods completed before the date of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union in order to mitigate the risks associated with the so-called 'no deal' scenario. CONTENT: the proposal aims at ensuring that persons who have exercised, as Union citizens, their right to freedom of movement before the withdrawal date maintain their social security entitlements related to facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. Other relevant persons in situations involving the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, should also maintain those entitlements: stateless persons, refugees, as well as family members and survivors of all the previous categories. Certain core principles of social security coordination as enshrined in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems (assimilation, aggregation, equality of treatment), as well as rules of this Regulation which give practical effect to the implementation of those principles (such as the pro-rata calculation of an old-age pension), should continue to apply in respect of those persons, as regards facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. The proposal does not concern rights accrued after 29 March 2019, nor the exportability of cash benefits, the continued provision of sickness benefits in kind and the rules on applicable legislation. This Regulation shall apply as from the day following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 82/891/EEC, Council Directive 89/666/EEC, Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council have been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, whilst stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, this proposal seeks to codify the following directives: Sixth Council Directive concerning the division of public limited liability companies (82/891/EEC), Eleventh Council Directive concerning disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State (89/666/EEC), Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning mergers of public limited liability companies, Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive lays down measures concerning the following: the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital; the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States concerning disclosure requirements in respect of public and private limited liability companies; the disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State; mergers of public limited liability companies; cross-border mergers of limited liability companies; the division of public limited liability companies.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 19 May 2010 on a Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), the Commission stressed that interoperability is essential to maximise the social and economic potential of ICT and that, consequently, the Digital Agenda can take off only if interoperability is ensured. As mentioned in its 2013 annual growth survey, the Commission considers the cross-border interoperability of online services and the digitisation of European public administrations to be important contributors to growth and increased efficiency. To enable efficient and effective interaction with citizens and businesses, Member States should modernise their administrations and provide interoperable digital services at national and European level. However, because it takes place at national level and lacks European-level interoperability, such change very often throws up electronic barriers (‘e-barriers’) that prevent citizens and businesses from using public services efficiently and impede the smooth functioning of the internal market. Activities under the programmes put in place by the Commission since 1995 (IDA, IDABC and ISA) have contributed significantly to ensuring interoperability in the electronic exchange of information between European public administrations. In its Resolution of 20 April 2012, the European Parliament recognised the contribution and overarching role of the ISA Programme in defining, promoting and supporting the implementation of interoperability solutions and frameworks for European public administrations. It also called for an increase in the financial allocations for interoperability solutions between the EU public administrations for 2014-2020. With the ISA Programme coming to an end on 31 December 2015, a new EU programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens is needed. On 24 and 25 October 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions stressing that the modernisation of public administrations should continue, with the swift implementation of services, such as e-government, e-health, e-invoicing and e-procurement that rely on interoperability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the 2012 interim evaluation for the ISA Programme, the Commission considers that the adoption of the new programme will help reduce the cost and administrative burden of cross-border interaction for all concerned, further improve the internal market and freedom of movement in the EU without administrative e-barriers, and contribute to the swift implantation of ICT systems supporting EU legislation. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to establish, for 2016-2020, a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (‘the ISA2 programme’). The proposed programme succeeds the ISA Programme and will consolidate, promote and expand its activities. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: improve, operate and re-use existing cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; develop, operate and re-use new cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; assess the ICT implications of proposed or adopted Union legislation and identify areas in which new legislation could promote interoperability; create a European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) to be used as the tool for building and assessing interoperability solutions; create an instrument to facilitate the re-use of existing interoperability solutions and to identify the areas in which such solutions are still missing; assess and promote existing common specifications and standards and develop new common specifications and standards; introduce a mechanism that will measure and quantify the benefits of interoperability solutions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for implementation of the new ISA2 Programme for the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 is EUR 130 928 000. The proposed envelope is consistent with the current Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 1999/32/EC has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 1999/32/EC of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EEC. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive seeks to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment. This Directive lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the Union. With regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, the proposal provides for: (i) derogations in Member States and regions where the environmental conditions allow; (ii) derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down in Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. To recall, in 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL), containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010. In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in the Union, the codified Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the defence industry is a major element of the economy of the European Union. For Europe to take over more responsibility for its defence, the Commission considers it crucial to improve competitiveness and enhance innovation across the Union defence industry. The proposal for a European defence industrial development programme aims at enhancing the competitiveness and innovation of the Union defence industry including cyber defence. In November 2016, the Commission adopted the European Defence Action Plan, which sets out measures to achieve greater European defence cooperation and support the competitiveness of the European defence industry. It proposed in particular to launch a European Defence Fund to support investment in joint research and the joint development of defence equipment and technologies. The initiative was welcomed by the European Council and the Commission was invited to present proposals in the first half of 2017. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to establish a European Defence Industrial Development Programme for Union action covering the period from 1st January 2019 to 31 December 2020. The amount for the implementation of the Programme for the period 2019-2020 is set at EUR 500 million in current prices. The Commission will be responsible for the execution and the management structure of the programme. The Programme shall have the following objectives: to foster the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the Union defence industry by supporting actions in their development phase; to support and leverage the cooperation between undertakings in the development of technologies or products in line with defence capability priorities; to foster better exploitation of the results of defence research and contribute to closing the gaps between research and development. The programme will help create a collaborative approach between defence industrial players of the Member States and is expected to reduce wasteful duplications, dispersions and create economies of scale. Union's financial assistance : this shall take the form of grants and financial instruments or via public procurement. The programme shall support the design, definition of common technical specifications, prototyping, testing, qualification and certification of defence products, tangible or intangible components and technologies. Support can also be provided for studies, feasibility assessments and other support activities. Eligible entities : the action shall be undertaken in a cooperation of at least three undertakings which are established in at least two different Member States. Beneficiaries shall be undertakings established in the Union, in which Member States and/or nationals of Member States own more than 50% of the undertaking and effectively control it, whether directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate undertakings. The financial assistance of the Union provided under the Programme may not exceed 20% of the total cost of the action where it relates to prototyping. In all the other cases, the assistance may cover up to the total cost of the action. Award criteria : actions proposed for funding under the Programme shall be evaluated on the basis of the following cumulative criteria: excellence; contribution to the innovation and technological development of defence industries; contribution to the security and defence interests of the Union by enhancing defence technologies which contribute to implement defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the Union; viability of actions, the contribution to the competitiveness of the European defence industry through the demonstration by the beneficiaries that Member States have committed to jointly produce and procure the final product or technology in a coordinated way. The Commission shall regularly monitor the implementation of the programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in view of the end of the transitional period provided for in the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom has applied to the Commission for recognition of the equivalence, from 1 January 2021, of forest reproductive material produced in that country with that produced in the EU in accordance with the respective Union law. The Commission has examined the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom. It has concluded that forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, produced in the United Kingdom is equivalent to forest reproductive material produced in the EU, since the former affords the same assurances as regards the approval of its basic material and the measures taken for its production with a view to marketing as the latter. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the Union recognises the equivalence of forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, with the respective material produced within the Union. This recognition is based on an examination of the legislation applicable in the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and systems in place are equivalent to those of the Union. Following the addition of the United Kingdom to the list of countries in Annex I to Decision 2008/97/EC, imports into the Union of forest reproductive material from the United Kingdom would be authorised."

3593EP7,"""""Transparency of measures regulating the prices of medicinal products for human use""""",0.895,0.861,0.018,0.645,0.394,0.88,0.851,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve the transparency of measures regulating the prices of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of public health insurance systems. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 89/105/EEC relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems was adopted so as to remove distortions to intra-Community trade in medicinal products. Directive 89/105/EEC has never been amended since its adoption. Its provisions reflect the pharmaceutical market conditions which prevailed more than twenty years ago. However, these conditions have fundamentally changed, for instance with the emergence of generic medicines providing cheaper versions of existing products or the development of increasingly innovative (yet often expensive) research-based medicinal products. In parallel, the constant rise in public expenditure on pharmaceuticals in the last decades has encouraged Member States to devise more complex and innovative pricing and reimbursement systems over time. Despite the historically positive impact of Directive 89/105/EEC on the internal market for medicines, there is evidence that it does not fully achieve its objectives in the present context: (1) A gap has emerged between the provisions of the Directive, which describe the main types of pricing and reimbursement procedures established in the 1980s, and the much wider range of cost-containment measures adopted nowadays by Member States. Despite the extensive interpretation of the Directive by the Court of Justice, the implementation of its provisions in national law and the effective enforcement of its principles, in particular by the Commission, have become particularly challenging. This situation not only results in legal uncertainties but also in a reduced transparency of national pricing and reimbursement measures, which negatively affects the smooth functioning of the internal market to the detriment of European patients and pharmaceutical companies. (2) The time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions established by Directive 89/105/EEC are regularly exceeded by Member States. This leads to delays in the marketing of medicinal products, which in turn slows down the availability of valuable treatments for patients. In order to take into account the evolution of the pharmaceutical market and of national policies to control public expenditure on medicines, substantive changes are necessary to all major provisions of Directive 89/105/EEC. Therefore, in the interest of clarity, Directive 89/105/EEC should be replaced. The fundamental objectives and principles of Directive 89/105/EEC remain fully valid in the present context. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal to revise the Directive is based on the combination of options recommended in the framework of the impact assessment, namely: to ensure timely pricing and reimbursement decisions : options A.3/c (regular reports on pricing and reimbursement approval times), A.4/a (shorter time-limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions concerning generic medicinal products) and A.4/b (prohibition of patent linkage and re-assessment of safety features); to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Directive in the current context : options B.3/b (extensive revision of the Directive to clarify its scope and wording) and B.4 (notification of draft national measures to facilitate enforcement). The possible extension of the Directive to include medical devices was examined in the impact assessment but discarded due to the specificities of this market. Furthermore, in spite of the difficulty to conclude on the overall cost-benefit balance of reducing the time limits with respect to originator medicines, a reduction from the current 90/180 days to 60/120 days is proposed in light of the positive impact it would have on the swift availability of innovative medicines to patients and on rewarding pharmaceutical innovation when medicines are approved for reimbursement. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: t he overall objective of the proposal is to clarify the procedural obligations incumbent upon Member State and to ensure the effectiveness of the Directive, both in avoiding delays in pricing and reimbursement decisions and in preventing barriers to pharmaceutical trade. This shall be done without affecting national social security policies, except as far as it is necessary to achieve the transparency of national procedures and the effectiveness of the internal market legislation. The proposal maintains the core principles of the existing Directive but also puts forward a comprehensive adaptation of its legal provisions based on the following key elements: Clarification of the scope of the Directive : the transparency requirements apply to all pricing and reimbursement measures understood in a broad sense, including “demand side” measures to control or promote the prescription of specific medicines. Nevertheless, measures involving public procurement and voluntary contractual agreements with individual companies are excluded from the scope of the Directive in order to avoid interference with other bodies of law. Comprehensive coverage of national measures and legal clarity : the provisions of the Directive are reworded in accordance with general principles (rather than on the basis of specific national procedures) and incorporate the case-law of the Court of Justice. Several key provisions are clarified and updated to avoid interpretation controversies. In particular, it is made clear that the time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions include all procedural steps leading to the decision, including health technology assessments where applicable. Adaptation of the time limits for pricing and reimbursement decisions : the time limits applicable to generic medicines are reduced to 15/30 days when the reference product has already been priced and included in the health insurance system. The time limits applicable to all other medicinal products are reduced to 60/120 days. However, in cases where national authorities subject medicinal products to health technology assessment procedures in order to assess the relative efficacy or the short- and long-term effectiveness, as an integral part of their decision-making process, the time-limits shall be 90/180 days. Non-interference of patent and safety issues with pricing and reimbursement procedures : the proposal clarifies that intellectual property rights should not interfere with pricing and reimbursement procedures, as is already the case for marketing authorisation procedures. In addition, elements already assessed in the framework of the marketing authorisation process (quality, safety and efficacy, including bioequivalence) may not be reassessed in the framework of pricing and reimbursement procedures. Dialogue and enforcement tools : different instruments are put in place to facilitate dialogue on the implementation of the Directive and to ensure its effective enforcement (consultation on draft measures at national level and pre-notification to the Commission, the creation of a remedies procedure in case of non-compliance with the time-limits related to the inclusion of medicinal products in health insurance systems). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the C ommission's proposal has no impact on the European Union budget beyond what is already foreseen for the years to come in the Multiannual Financial Framework. Total appropriations under headings 1 to 5 of the multiannual financial framework are estimated at EUR 0.859 million (2014); EUR 1.293 million (2015); EUR 1.143 million (2016-2017); EUR 1.093 (2018 action continued)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning of each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation. Article 25 of this regulation determines that the total amount of the reserve for crises in agricultural sector shall be EUR 2 800 million with equal annual instalments of EUR 400 million (at 2011 prices) for the period 2014-2020 and shall be included under Heading 2 of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget. The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices. Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure, the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely to be exceeded. Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is only to apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the corresponding calendar year. Furthermore, it provides that as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustment rate is only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia from 1 January 2022. The Commission has to present a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate no later than 31 March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustment rate applies. CONTENT: this proposal aims to implement the provisions of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. It seeks to set the percentage rate of the financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015. The proposed Regulation lays down the amounts of direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be reduced by 1.393041%. The reduction shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: high-speed broadband infrastructure is the backbone of the Digital Single Market and a precondition for worldwide competitiveness, for example, in the field of e-Commerce. According to the 2010 report on the Single Market, telecommunications services and infrastructures in the EU are still highly fragmented along national borders. A recent report on the cost of non-Europe in the electronic communications sector has shown that the untapped potential of the Single Market corresponds to a yearly amount of 0.9% GDP, or EUR 110 billion. As recalled in the Communication on the Single Market Act II, a 10% increase in broadband penetration can result in a 1-1.5 % increase in the GDP annually and 1.5% labour productivity gains. Broadband-induced innovation in companies creates employment and has the potential to generate 2 million extra jobs by 2020. The Union has subscribed to ambitious broadband targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe: by 2013, basic broadband for all Europeans, and by 2020, (i) access to speeds of above 30 Mbps for all Europeans, and (ii) subscription of internet connection above 100 Mbps for 50% or more of European households. These goals will only be achieved if the infrastructure deployment costs are lowered across the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission analysed four options: ·  Option 1 (Status quo) : maintaining the current approach of monitoring, enforcement and guidance. ·  Option 2 : recommending measures towards a more coherent and harmonised application by National Regulatory Authorities of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. ·  Option 3 : a proposal for a Regulation aiming at unlocking the potential of cross-sector cooperation (two sub-options, 3a and 3b, discuss options regarding respectively, a regulation only and a combination of a regulation and a recommendation). ·  Option 4 : a proposal for legislation complementing the current regulatory framework to mandate measures going beyond option 3, (such as infrastructure atlases, cost-oriented infrastructure access, mandated cooperation in civil engineering works even when not financed by public means, and installation of high-speed-ready infrastructure even in old buildings). The impact assessment concludes that option 3a is the best option available, given its effectiveness in achieving the objectives identified, the costs-benefits analysis, and ability to exploit the cost reduction potential efficiently and coherently with general EU policy objectives. A study estimates that if measures were taken to address the problems identified, the potential capital savings to operators are in the range of 20–30% of total investment costs, i.e. up to EUR 63 billion by 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the objectives of the proposed Regulation are to reduce the cost and enhance the efficiency of deploying high-speed electronic communications infrastructure by scaling up existing best practices across the EU. In order to do this, the proposal sets out a number of directly applicable rights and obligations across the various steps of infrastructure deployment, which can lead to significant cost reductions. The proposal aims to lower the barriers to investment and market entry (i) by allowing for more intensive usage of existing physical infrastructures, (ii) by enhancing cooperation on planned civil works, (iii) by streamlining procedures on granting permits and (iv) by removing obstacles to high-speed-ready in-building infrastructure. This initiative therefore addresses four main problem areas: ·  inefficiencies or bottlenecks concerning the use of existing physical infrastructure (such as ducts, conduits, manholes, cabinets, poles, masts, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions); ·  bottlenecks related to co-deployment; ·  inefficiencies regarding the granting of administrative permits; ·  bottlenecks concerning in-building deployment. In order to maximise synergies across networks, the regulation is aimed not only at electronic communications network providers but to any owner of physical infrastructures, such as electricity, gas, water and sewage, heating and transport services, which are suitable for hosting electronic communications network elements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

Unusually, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union and Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety, Member States had a choice of two transposition deadlines – 16 June 2019, or, upon notification to the Commission and the European Union Agency for Railways, 16 June 2020. Only eight Member States have transposed both Directives in 2019 (BG, FI, FR, GR, IT, NL, RO, SI). In the light of COVID-19 outbreak, most of the remaining 17 Member States have requested a delay to transposition, claiming they will be unable to complete the necessary legislation before 16 June 2020. Since the COVID-19 outbreak struck in the final stage of adoption of the national transposition measures, it is proposed that Member States should be allowed an additional period of three months to complete the transposition process. Given the extraordinary circumstances, it is entirely understandable that final transposition may be impossible before 16 June 2020. CONTENT: therefore, the Commission proposes that Member States should be able to complete the process in an additional period of three months (16 September 2020). A number of implementing acts and delegated acts have been adopted in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798. Given the dual transposition deadline, according transitional provisions and dates for entry into force have been introduced therein. The Commission shall propose a set of amendments to the implementing acts to align them with the extension of the transposition deadlines following the adoption of the proposed Directive. For the relevant delegated acts, the existing procedure set out in Directive (EU) 2016/798 would not allow an alignment with the extension of the transposition deadlines on time. Thus, a legal basis and simplified procedure for the further alignment is provided in the proposal."

The measures taken so far have not effectively solved the main problems of the fishery, these being: Due to deep-sea stocks' high vulnerability to fishing, stock depletion can occur within a short period of time, and recovery might take very long or fail. The stocks' biological state is largely unknown. Some are considered depleted, others have started to stabilise at low levels of exploitation. In general the fisheries are not sustainable. A new regulation is required in order to deal with these problems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of impacts resulting from different policy choices focussed on five options. Three of these were not considered further because they were considered not representing meaningful management approaches, with disadvantages largely outweighing advantages, namely: (i) to continue the current regime amending it only by needed updates; (ii) to ban fishing for deep-sea species altogether, and (iii) to scale the regime down to being a tool for transposing measures adopted in NEAFC and applying those measures also in Union waters. The two options with relative advantage were: (iv) to phase out the most harmful fishing gears targeting deep-sea species, or (v) to introduce in Union waters management standards that were developed for bottom fishing on the High Sea. Option (iv) was retained as being a more effective and simpler instrument. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes a framework Regulation for exercising fishing activity targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantics, comprising Union waters including outermost regions of Spain and Portugal, and international waters. The objectives of this Regulation are the following: ·  to ensure the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea species while minimising the impact of deep-sea fishing activities on the marine environment; ·  to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats for these purposes; ·  to implement technical measures on fisheries management recommended by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Ensure sustainable exploitation : the general objective of the proposal is to ensure as much as possible the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea stocks while reducing the environmental impact of these fisheries, and to improve the information base for scientific assessment. As long as data and method have not achieved the required level allowing MSY-based management, the fisheries have to be managed according to the precautionary approach to fisheries management. Protect marine ecosystems : in order to reduce the destructive impact on the marine ecosystem, the use of bottom trawls should be phased out in this fishery, as they are most harmful to vulnerable marine ecosystems and have shown high levels of undesired catch of deep-sea species. The transitional restrictions on bottom-set gillnets in fisheries below 600m depth and in the depth-range 200-600m should be accompanied by a prohibition to target deep-sea species. Simplifying the management system for these stocks : the proposal also considers the opportunity to simplify the management system for these stocks, currently subject to a double instrument: catch limitations and capacity/effort limitation. Where this duplication is not necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, proposals are made to regulate the concerned fisheries with only one management instrument. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code). The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main codified provisions : Purpose, scope and application : this Regulation provides for the absence of border control of persons crossing the internal borders between the Member States of the European Union. It lays down rules governing border control of persons crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union. In addition, it establishes the list of persons to which it the absence of control to internal borders applies. Border checks should be carried out in such a way as to fully respect human dignity. Border control should be carried out in a professional and respectful manner and be proportionate to the objectives pursued. Types of controls : the Regulation provides that border control comprises not only checks on persons at border crossing points and surveillance between those border crossing points, but also an analysis of the risks for internal security and of the threats that may affect the security of external borders. Therefore, the Regulation sets out the conditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at border crossing points and surveillance at the border, including checks in the Schengen Information System (SIS). Since only a verification of fingerprints can confirm with certainty that a person wishing to enter the Schengen area is the person to whom the visa has been issued, provisions have been made for the use at external borders of the Visa Information System (VIS). Exceptional circumstances and controls : the Regulations stipulates that it should be possible to have checks at external borders relaxed in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances in order to avoid excessive waiting time at border crossing points. The systematic stamping of the documents of third-country nationals remains an obligation in the event of border checks being relaxed. Stamping makes it possible to establish, with certainty, the date on which, and where, the border was crossed. In order to reduce the waiting times of persons enjoying the Union right of free movement, separate lanes, indicated by uniform signs in all Member States, should, where circumstances allow, be provided at border crossing points. Separate lanes should be provided in international airports. Where it is deemed appropriate and if local circumstances so allow, Member States should consider installing separate lanes at sea and land border crossing points. Exceptional reintroduction of controls and serious threats : the reintroduction of internal border control should remain exceptional. In an area without internal border control, it is necessary to have a common response to situations seriously affecting the public policy or internal security of that area, of parts thereof, or of one or more Member States, by allowing for the temporary reintroduction of internal border control in exceptional circumstances, but without jeopardising the principle of the free movement of persons. Given the impact that such measures of last resort may have on all persons having the right to move within the area without internal border control, the conditions and procedures for reintroducing such measures should be provided for, in order to ensure that they are exceptional and that the principle of proportionality is respected. In any case, the reintroduction of internal border control should remain an exception and should only be effected as a measure of last resort, for a strictly limited scope and period of time, based on specific objective criteria and on an assessment of its necessity which should be monitored at Union level. Where a serious threat to public policy or internal security requires immediate action, a Member State should be able to reintroduce border control at its internal borders for a period not exceeding ten days. Any prolongation of that period needs to be monitored at Union level. Conditions for the reintroduction of internal border control : the reintroduction of internal border control might exceptionally be necessary in the case of terrorist incidents or threats, or because of threats posed by organised crime. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders may only be justified under a specific Union-level procedure. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders could also be justified in the case of exceptional circumstances and as a measure of last resort where the overall functioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control identified in the context of a rigorous evaluation process in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings. In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. This draft Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should also be noted that in order to provide urgent financing, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. This period refers to elapse of time between a draft legislative act being made available to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a provisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a position under a legislative procedure. CONTENT: the Council proposes that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (MFF Regulation) should therefore be amended to stipulate that the commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the Global Margin for Commitments. Margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global Margin for Commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), the Commission carried out, in 2016, a review of the total amounts allocated to Member States for the “Investment for Growth and Jobs” goal of cohesion policy for 2017-2020, The Commission presented in its communication of 30 June 2017 the results of this review to the Council and the European Parliament. The review indicated that: on the basis of the most recent statistics, there is a cumulative divergence of more than +/– 5 % between the total and the revised allocations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom ; on the basis of its gross national income (GNI) per capita figures of 2012-2014, Cyprus will become fully eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund as of 1 January 2017. The review of the total amounts allocated also includes the decision to extend the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) to the years 2017 to 2020. The Council decided to extend the YEI until 2020 with an amount of EUR 1.2 billion in current prices for the specific allocation for the YEI, which needs to be complemented by at least EUR 1.2 billion from targeted ESF investment. Insofar as the revision had an impact on the annual breakdown of the allocations for the global resources by Member State under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and under the European Territorial Cooperation Goal as well as on the Youth Employment Initiative, it was implemented by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1941. The total net effect of those adjustments is to increase the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion by EUR 4 billion. Regulation (EU) No 1303/2016 needs to be amended accordingly. CONTENT: the proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 includes: regulatory provisions regarding the review of the allocations of cohesion policy for the years 2017-2020; the decisions to transfer resources between categories and goals; the decision to extend the YEI to the years 2017 to 2020 and the decision to transfer some commitment appropriations of 2014 to subsequent years. In terms of the amendments proposed, the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for budgetary commitment will be EUR 329 978 401 458, of which: EUR 325 938 694 233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund and EUR 4 039 707 225 represents a specific allocation for the YEI. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to adjust: the resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal and their allocation between less developed regions, transition regions, more developed regions, Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund and outermost regions; resources for the European territorial cooperation goal. Furthermore, an amount of EUR 9 446 050 652 in current prices of the allocation provided for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund which could not be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015 will be transferred to subsequent years. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is an impact on commitment appropriations equal to EUR 4 billion. These additional resources will also generate needs for additional payment appropriations for the years 2018 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: online platforms are key enablers of digital trade. At present, more than a million EU enterprises trade through online platforms in order to reach their customers, and it is estimated that around 60% of private consumption and 30% of public consumption of goods and services related to the total digital economy are transacted via online intermediaries. The growing intermediation of transactions through online intermediation services, fuelled by strong data-driven indirect network effects, lead to an increased dependence of such business users, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, on those services in order for them to reach consumers. The dependence of businesses on certain online services implies that the providers of such online intermediation services have a scope to engage in a number of potentially harmful trading practices which limit business users' sales through them and risk undermining their trust, notably: unexplained changes in terms and conditions without prior notice; the delisting of goods or services and the suspension of accounts without a clear statement of reasons; lack of transparency related to the ranking of goods and services and of the undertakings offering them; unclear conditions for access to, and use of, data collected by providers. Furthermore, online general search engines exhibit a dependency-enabled issue, specifically for potentially harmful ranking practices, which may affect business users. Building on extensive stakeholder consultation, this initiative contributes to the objectives of the digital single market strategy by creating a clear, transparent and stable legal environment for online B2C service providers and their business users, in order to combat market fragmentation and ensure that businesses using online intermediation services have access to redress opportunities throughout the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the optimal policy choice aims to provide legally binding transparency and redress obligations on the full range of potentially harmful trading practices identified as part of this initiative, including transparency for the issue of ranking in online general search. The Commission considers that the proposal should be capable of reversing a dampening effect on the online platform economy resulting from a lack of trust of business users amounting to at least between EUR 810 million and EUR 4 billion. CONTENT: the proposed new Regulation: lays down obligations for providers of online intermediation services and, in certain respects, online search engines to provide business users and corporate website users, respectively, with appropriate transparency and to offer them certain redress possibilities; obliges providers of online intermediation services to ensure that their terms and conditions: (i) are drafted in clear and unambiguous language; (ii) are easily available for business users; (iii) set out the objective grounds for decisions to suspend or terminate, in whole or in part, the provision of their online intermediation services to business users; establishes requirements for a statement of reasons from a provider of online intermediation services if it suspends or terminates the use by a business user of its intermediation services; establishes requirements for a description of the main parameters determining ranking of business users in search results, including a description where ranking is influenced by the business user giving direct or indirect remuneration to them, in the terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement to include a description of the access to personal data or other data which business users or consumers provide to online intermediation services or which are generated through those services, in the standard terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement for providers of online intermediation services to list in their terms and conditions one or more mediators with which the provider is willing to engage to reach an agreement out of court on a dispute, for instance where an issue has not been resolved by the internal complaint handling system; establishes a requirement for the Commission to encourage providers of online intermediation services to individually or jointly set up one or more independent mediator organisations to facilitate the settlement, out of court, of disputes that arise in the course of online intermediation services, particularly given their cross-border nature; establishes a right for judicial proceedings to be brought by representative organisations, associations or public bodies to stop or prohibit any non-compliance by providers of online intermediation services with the requirements contained in the Regulation."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is a global leader in environmental protection and climate action. The Commission considers the shift towards a clean, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy to be a priority. The programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE), established by Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 for the period 2014 to 2020, is the latest in a series of Union programmes over 25 years which support the implementation of environmental and climate legislation and policy priorities. Through its catalytic role, the programme supports small scale actions intended to initiate, expand or promote sustainable production, distribution and consumption practices, as well as to protect natural heritage. The Commission considers that this approach should be continued in the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. An enhanced LIFE programme would play an important role in developing climate action and clean energy investments across Europe. It would also help the EU meet its climate objectives and commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN’s sustainable development goals. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the environment and climate action programme (LIFE). It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, as well as the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Programme objectives : the proposed programme aims to achieve the Union’s objectives as set out in international environmental, climate and clean energy legislation, policy, plans and commitments. Its overall objective is to contribute to the shift towards: a clean, circular, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, including a transition to clean energy; protecting and improving the quality of the environment; halting and reversing biodiversity loss, including in marine ecosystems, so as to contribute to sustainable development. In particular, the new LIFE programme shall: mobilise investment and support energy efficiency activities, particularly in European regions lagging behind in the shift towards clean energy; support projects promoting best practice in relation to nature protection and biodiversity, as well as ‘strategic nature protection projects’ for all Member States, including measures to protect the marine environment; contribute to the transition to a circular economy model through financial support targeting a variety of actors (businesses, public authorities and consumers), in particular by applying, developing, and replicating best technology, practices and solutions tailored to specific local, regional or national contexts, including through integrated approaches for the implementation of waste management and prevention plans; support the other aspects of the Union's environment policy, such as the protection and improvement of air and water quality in the EU, implementing the 2030 climate and energy policy framework and meeting the Union’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. Actions taken under the programme are expected to contribute 61 % of the overall financial envelope of the programme to climate objectives. The Commission proposes to simplify the programme management procedures and allow for a wider geographical access. Synergies would be developed with the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, Horizon Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility and InvestEU. Proposed budget : EUR 5.45 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027. The indicative breakdown of this amount is as follows: Environment : EUR 3.5 billion of which: (i) EUR 2.15 billion for the Nature and Biodiversity sub-programme; (ii) EUR 1.35 billion for the Circular Economy and Quality of Life sub-programme; Climate action : EUR 1.95 billion of which: (i) EUR 950 million for the sub-programme Climate change mitigation and adaptation; (ii) EUR 1 billion for the sub-programme clean energy transition."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 setting up the European GNSS Agency. PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: BACKGROUND: security requirements play an essential role in the design, implementation and operation of the infrastructures emerging from the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. The provisions of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 expressly lay down the terms under which the Agency must perform its task concerning security accreditation of the systems. In order to ensure that the security accreditation activities are performed in an independent manner, including, to a large extent, the Regulation provides the Agency with an independent body, the Security Accreditation Board, which constitutes one of the three separate roles of the Agency along with the Executive Director and the Administrative Board. On 30 November 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on the implementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems. This future GNSS Regulation will replace Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 as of 1 January 2012 and determine the governance framework during the 2014-2020 period. In particular, it stipulates that most of the tasks associated with the operation of both the Galileo and EGNOS systems will be entrusted to the European GNSS Agency. The commitment expressed by the Commission in its proposal to delegating these tasks to the Agency is shared by the European Parliament and the Council. In this new context, it is essential to ensure that the Security Accreditation Board is able to carry out the task entrusted to it with complete independence, in particular vis-à-vis the other bodies and activities of the Agency. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission's proposal was not subject to an impact assessment; nor did it follow formal consultation of the parties concerned. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 with a view ensuring the independence of the exercise of activities relating to security systems accreditation as well as the separation between these activities and other activities of the European GNSS Agency. To do so, the proposal provides mainly for an increase in the powers of the Security Accreditation Board and those of the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board, by partly aligning them with those of the Administrative Board and the Executive Director respectively, while providing for a cooperation requirement between the various bodies of the Agency. Security Accreditation Board: it is proposed that this Board, and not the Administrative Board prepares and approves the part of the Agency work programmes describing the operational activities associated with security accreditation of the systems as well as the part of the annual report concerning the activities and prospects of the Agency with regard to the systems' security accreditation activities and submits them in good time to the Administrative Board so that they can be incorporated in the Agency's work programme and annual report. Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board: it would be desirable to assign a role in relation to security accreditation activities to the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board comparable to that of the Executive Director in other Agency activities. Therefore, in addition to the function of representing the Agency, already provided for under Regulation (EU) No 912/2010, the Chairperson of the Security Accreditation Board should: manage the security accreditation activities under the direction of the Security Accreditation Board and ensure the implementation of the part of the Agency work programmes associated with accreditation; at the request of the Parliament or the Council, submit a report on the performance of its tasks and make a declaration before these institutions. Furthermore, given the involvement of a number of third countries in the European GNSS programmes, including in security matters, express provision should be made for representatives of third countries to be able to participate under conditions to be specified in the work of the Security Accreditation Board. Lastly, Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 must be made consistent with the principles contained in the shared approach of the Parliament, Council and Commission to the decentralised agencies, adopted by the three institutions on 5 July, 26 June and 12 June 2012 respectively. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the legislative financial statement associated with Regulation (EU) No 912/2010, which accompanies the proposal and incorporates the new staff requirements of the Agency relating to the new tasks which may be entrusted to it, such as the exploitation of the European GNSS systems, translates these requirements in financial terms. In budgetary terms, the amounts required are already included in the Commission's proposal for the next financial framework 2014-2020. They will be financed by redeployment within the budget headings of the GNSS programmes in the same way as the additional requirements for 2013. It should be noted that the expenditure associated with the new staff requirements of the Agency will be partially offset by a reduction of 30 posts in the Commission's establishment plan during the same period, i.e. from 2014 to 2020. The total estimated impact on the Agency’s budget (operational and administrative expenditure) amounts to EUR 204.318 million for the period 2013-2020. This estimate is provisional because it is dependent on the adoption of the next multiannual finanancial framework 2014-2020 by the budgetary authority."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Tunisian economy has been negatively affected by the domestic unrest that followed the 2011 revolution, regional instability (notably the war in Libya). In particular, the fiscal and balance of payments situation has deteriorated quite markedly, generating important financing needs. At the same time, following the ousting of President Ben Ali on 14 January 2011, the country is taking significant steps towards the establishment of democratic mechanisms. However, the political transition has not been without difficulties and episodes of instability. Against this background, the Tunisian authorities reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion (400% of quota), which was approved by the IMF Board in June. The aim of the SBA is to support the government’s economic reform programme, reduce economic vulnerabilities and foster sustainable and inclusive growth. In this context, the Tunisian government requested Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million on 28 August 2013, with a portion in the form of a grant. The European Commission submits to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal to grant a MFA to the Republic of Tunisia amounting to a maximum of EUR 250 million. The assistance would take the form of medium-term loans, with no grant component being envisaged given that Tunisia does not meet the eligibility criteria for the use of grants in MFA operations. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make available to Tunisia MFA for a total maximum amount of EUR 250 million in order to: contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2014-15; support the fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of the IMF programme; facilitate and encourage efforts of the authorities of Tunisia to implement measures identified under the EU-Tunisia ENP Action Plan, and; support structural reform efforts aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management, strengthening economic governance and transparency, and improving conditions for sustainable growth. The full amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Tunisia in the form of loans. The loans shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. The Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions and to on-lend them to Tunisia. Disbursement of assistance : the assistance is planned to be disbursed in three loan instalments: - the disbursement of the first instalment (EUR 90 million) is expected to take place in mid-2014; - the second instalment (EUR 80 million), conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed towards the end of 2014; - the third and last instalment (EUR 80 million) could be made available, provided the policy measures are met, during the first half of 2015. Implementing conditions : respects effective democratic mechanisms : a pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance should be that Tunisia respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. Both fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission; release of the Union's macro-financial assistance : this shall be managed by the Commission in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Tunisia; implementing reforms : the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment). The proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Decreased assistance : where the financing needs of Tunisia decrease fundamentally during the period of the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance compared to the initial projections, the Commission, acting in accordance with the examination procedure, shall reduce the amount of the assistance or suspend or cancel it. Where the circumstances permit, and if Tunisia so requests, the Commission may take the steps necessary to ensure that an early repayment clause is included in the loan terms and conditions and that it is matched by a corresponding clause in the terms and conditions of the borrowing operations. Implementing conditions : in order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the Tunisian authorities under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used for operations above that threshold as well as to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the assistance. Reports : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation. Not later than two years after the expiry of the availability period, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council an ex post evaluation report, assessing the results and efficiency of the completed Union's macro-financial assistance and the extent to which it has contributed to the aims of the assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (""the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2014 for a total amount of EUR 170 million and the third loan disbursement in 2015 for the amount of EUR 80 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2016-17 budgets."
2290EP7,"""""Sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography""""",0.632,0.747,0.737,0.516,0.545,0.843,0.769,0.143,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to recast Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA on the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography by including new provisions aimed at making it more effective. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: with regard to child victims, the main cause of this phenomenon is vulnerability resulting from a variety of factors. Insufficient response by law enforcement mechanisms contributes to the prevalence of these phenomena, and the difficulties are exacerbated because certain forms of offences transcend national borders. Victims are reluctant to report abuse, variations in national criminal law and procedure may give rise to differences in investigation and prosecution, and convicted offenders may continue to be dangerous after serving their sentences. Developments in information technology have made these problems more acute by making it easier to produce and distribute child sexual abuse images while offering offenders anonymity and spreading responsibility across jurisdictions. Ease of travel and income differences fuel so-called child sex tourism, resulting often in child sex offenders committing offences abroad with impunity. National legislation covers some of these problems, to varying degrees. However, it is not strong or consistent enough to provide a vigorous social response to this disturbing phenomenon. The recent Council of Europe Convention CETS No. 201 on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (""the COE Convention"") arguably constitutes the highest international standard for protecting children against sexual abuse and exploitation to date. However, not all Member States have yet acceded to this Convention. At EU level, Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA, introduces a minimum of approximation of Member States’ legislation to criminalise the most serious forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation, to extend domestic jurisdiction, and to provide for a minimum of assistance to victims. Although the requirements have generally been put into implementation, the Framework Decision has a number of shortcomings. It approximates legislation only on a limited number of offences, does not address new forms of abuse and exploitation using information technology, does not remove obstacles to prosecuting offences outside national territory, does not meet all the specific needs of child victims, and does not contain adequate measures to prevent offences. It is therefore necessary to recast this text in order to respond to the needs of these new challenges. It should be noted that this proposal would replace existing legislation in place since 2004, and builds on a proposal made on 25/03/2009. After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, this proposal has to be reshaped. This will allow the Commission to verify that EU law is correctly translated into national rules and take those countries that are not complying to Court. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered several options: option 1 : no new EU action; option 2 : complement existing legislation with non-legislative measures: Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA, would not be amended. Instead, non-legislative measures could be put in place to support coordinated implementation of national legislation. This would include exchanging information and experience in prosecution, protection or prevention, awareness raising, cooperation with private sector and encouragement of self regulation, or the setting up of mechanisms for data collection; option 3 : new legislation on prosecuting offenders, protecting victims, and preventing offences: a new legislative act would be adopted, incorporating the existing Framework Decision, certain provisions of the COE Convention, and additional elements not contained in either of these. It would cover prosecution of offenders, protection of the victims, and prevention of the phenomenon; option 4 : new comprehensive legislation: the existing provisions of Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA would be supplemented by EU action to amend substantive criminal law and procedure, protect victims, and prevent offences as under option 3, plus the non-legislative measures identified under option 2 to improve the implementation of national legislation. Following the analysis of the economic impact, social impacts, and impacts on fundamental rights, options 3 and 4 represent the best approach to the problems and achieve the objectives of the proposal. The preferred option would be option 4, followed by option 3. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82 (2) and 83 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Given the cross-border dimension, EU action is required as the objective of effectively protecting children cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States, either at central level or at regional or local level. CONTENT: the proposal will both repeal and incorporate Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA to include the following new elements: substantive criminal law : serious forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation currently not covered by EU legislation would be criminalised. This includes, for instance, the organisation of travel arrangements with the purpose of committing sexual abuse, something particularly relevant, but not exclusively, in the context of child sex tourism. The definition of child pornography is amended to approximate it to the COE Convention and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Special consideration is given to offences against children in a particularly vulnerable situation. In particular, the level of criminal penalties should be increased so that they are proportionate, effective and dissuasive. To determine the degree of seriousness and attach penalties proportionate to it, consideration is given to different factors which may intervene in very different sorts of offences, like the degree of harm to the victim, the level of culpability of the offender and the level of risk posed to society. Accordingly, a number of relations between offences can be established. In general terms, activities involving sexual contact are more serious than those which do not; the presence of exploitation makes the offence more serious than its absence; coercion, force or threats are more serious than abuse of a position of power of the offender or weakness of the victim, which in turn is more serious than free consent of the victim. Prostitution, which involves sexual activities and money, is more serious than pornographic performances, which may or may not include them; recruiting to prostitution or similar is more serious than mere causing, as it involves active seeking of children as commodities. On child pornography, production, usually involving recruiting and sexual contact with the child, is more serious than other offences like distribution or offering, which in turn are more serious than possession or access. As a result of combining these different criteria, distinction is thus made between five different groups of offences, depending on their degree of seriousness, leading to accordingly different levels of penalties for the basic crimes; new criminal offences in the IT environment : new forms of sexual abuse and exploitation facilitated by the use of IT would be criminalised. This includes on-line pornographic performances, or knowingly obtaining access to child pornography, to cover cases where viewing child pornography from websites without downloading or storing the images does not amount to ""possession of"" or ""procuring"" child pornography. Also the new offence of ""grooming"" is incorporated closely following the wording agreed in the COE Convention. criminal investigation and initiation of criminal proceedings : a number of provisions would be introduced to assist with investigating offences and bringing charges. A mechanism to coordinate prosecution in cases of multiple jurisdictions is included, but may be superseded once the proposal for a Framework Decision on conflict of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings is adopted; prosecution of offences committed abroad : rules on jurisdiction would be amended to ensure that child sexual abusers or exploiters from the EU, both nationals and habitual residents, face prosecution even if they commit their crimes outside the EU, via so-called sex tourism; protection of victims : new provisions will be included to ensure that victims have easy access to legal remedies and do not suffer from participating in criminal proceedings. They cover assistance and support to victims, and protection of victims specifically in criminal investigations and proceedings; prevention of offences : amendments would be introduced to help prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation offences, through a number of actions concentrating on previous offenders to prevent recidivism, and to restrict access to child pornography on the internet. The aim of restricting such access is to reduce the circulation of child pornography by making it more difficult to use the publicly-accessible Web. It is not a substitute for action to remove the content at the source or to prosecute offenders; other protective measures not contained in the COE Convention : the proposal includes elements not contained in the COE Convention, notably: (i) ensuring implementation across the EU of prohibitions from activities with children imposed on offenders; (ii) blocking access to child pornography on the internet; (iii) criminalising coercing a child into sexual relations with a third party and child sexual abuse online; (iv) a non-punishment clause for child victims. It also goes beyond the obligations imposed by the COE Convention regarding the level of penalties, free legal counselling for child victims and repression of activities encouraging abuse and child sex tourism. Moreover, incorporating provisions from the Convention into EU law will facilitate faster adoption of national measures compared to national procedures for ratification, and ensure better monitoring of implementation. Territorial scope : the adoption of the proposal will be addressed to the Member States. The application of the resulting Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols (No 21) and (No 22) annexed to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 established a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat stocks in the Baltic Sea. The objective of the plan is to ensure that the exploitation of the stocks concerned restores and maintains populations of these stocks above the levels that achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The scientific evaluation of the Bothnian Sea herring stock and the Bothnian Bay herring stock conducted in 2017 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) showed that those two stocks are similar. As a consequence, ICES combined the two stocks into one, changed the boundaries of its geographic distribution area and re-estimated the MSY fishing mortality ranges, as well as the relevant conservation reference points. Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 provides that where, on the basis of scientific advice, the Commission considers that the conservation reference points set out in Annex II to that Regulation no longer correctly express the objectives of the plan, those points, as a matter of urgency, may be submitted for the revision to the European Parliament and the Council. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to urgently amend Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 to ensure that the fishing opportunities for Gulf of Bothnia herring stocks are determined in accordance with the updated conservation reference points following the scientific evaluation carried out by ICES."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as ‘Stage V’, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."
6089EP7,"""""Production and making available on the market of plant reproductive material (plant reproductive material law)""""",0.053,0.846,0.877,0.194,0.576,0.193,0.892,0.343,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to set down rules on the production and making available on the market of plant reproductive material (PRM) with a view to ensuring the quality of that material and informed choices for users. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: “sustainable intensification"" and greening of food crop production, in which yields are increased without adverse environmental impact and without the cultivation of more land, have become a central concern. Plant reproductive material legislation is critically important for reaching this aim. The EU Forest Strategy emphasises the importance of the multifunctional role of forest and its sustainable management. The majority of Council Directives for making available on the market of plant reproductive material have first been adopted between 1966 and 1971 and some Directives are more recent. The complexity and fragmentation of the existing legislation is likely to perpetuate existing uncertainties and discrepancies in its implementation between the Member States. This creates an uneven playing field for professional operators on the single market. Developments in the areas of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, plant breeding and making available on the market of plant reproductive material have shown that the legislation needs to be simplified and further adapted to the developments of the sector by replacing the existing Directives by a single Regulation. This proposal is part of a comprehensive package that also includes three other proposals to modernise the plant health, animal health, and official controls acquis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that no single option succeeds in achieving the objectives of the review of the current system. The preferred option combines aspects that seek to strike a balance between flexibility for professional operators (Options 2 and 4), biodiversity (Option 4) and the necessary rigour in health and quality requirements (Options 2 and 5) for the fair functioning of the market and for maintaining the quality and health of plant reproductive material. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal consolidates and updates legislation on the placing on the market of plant reproductive material by repealing and replacing the 12 existing directives. Its main features may be summarised as follows: Objectives: the proposal seeks to: (i) ensure a level playing field across the EU through simplified, clarified and harmonised rules; (ii) reduce unnecessary costs and administrative burden and to increase flexibility; (iii) align PRM legislation with other recent Union strategies; and (iv) foster innovation in plant breeding. The scope of the proposed Regulation covers all forms of PRM. Professional operators: the proposal introduces basic obligations for professional operators concerning the identification of the plant reproductive material they are producing or making available on the market, keeping of records, facilitation of controls and maintenance of the material. The traceability of any plant reproductive material is ensured by the obligation for the professional operators to have information one step before and one step after their commercial activities. PRM other than forest reproductive material: the proposal maintains the basic approach on registration of varieties/material and certification/inspection of lots before making available on the market. However, more flexibility will be given to professional operators. In addition, secondary acts will be adopted setting out the specific requirements for the production and making available on the market of particular species and their categories (pre-basic, basic, certified and standard material). The proposal sets down the requirements for making available on the market of PRM. It retains certain derogations and introduces a derogation on niche market plant reproductive material. It also brings exports within the scope of the Regulation. Production and making available on the market of PRM belonging to non-listed genera or species: PRM not belonging to the listed genera and species shall also be subject to a few basic requirements with regard to its health status, fitness for purpose, appropriate reference to varieties, where applicable, and identification of the respective material and imports. Registration of varieties in national and Union registers: the varieties, in order to be made available on the market throughout the Union, shall be included in a national register or in the Union register via direct application procedure to the CVPO. CPVO will keep the updated information on all plant varieties that can be made available on the market in the Union, including the varieties registered in national registers (Union plant variety database). The proposal establishes the detailed requirements for the variety registration Procedure. A new obligation for each national variety examination centre to be audited by the CPVO will be introduced with the aim to ensure the quality and harmonisation of the variety registration process in the Union. Concerning old varieties, less stringent requirements should continue to be laid down. Production and making available on the market of forest reproductive material: the EU legislation sets a specific approach on forest reproductive material. The proposal establishes the requirements applicable to forest reproductive material. Derogations are envisaged in regard to: (i) authorisation of more stringent national requirements; (ii) prohibition to make available to end-user specified forest reproductive material; and (iii) rules concerning temporary difficulties in supply and rules concerning temporary experiments. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial appropriations for implementing the Regulation up to 31 December 2020 are presented in the Regulation on laying down provisions for the management of expenditure relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare, and relating to plant health and plant reproductive material. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal includes provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa became applicable as of 1 January 2014. Furthermore, Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management also became applicable on the same date. Under this Regulation, the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the Internal Security Fund (the ISF-Borders and Visa). The purpose of the ISF-Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. The ISF-Borders and Visa will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an 'efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders'. It is thus a development of the Schengen acquis. Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors, as the respective Association Agreements do not provide for such rules. The aim of the draft Agreement with Norway is to establish the arrangements of this participation and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: under this proposal, it is proposed that the Council adopt the Decision in which it is called upon to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. Rules for the participation of Norway in the ISF-Borders and Visas: the Agreement provides for a number of technical provisions to establish the framework for participation. The funds allocated to Norway under the ISF-Borders and Visa shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management. Protection of the financial interests of the Union against fraud is also stressed. Budgetary control: provisions are laid down as regards budgetary and financial controls. Member States shall be subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the Court of Auditors and of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) derived either directly from the Treaty or from secondary Union legislation. Moreover, the Court of Auditors and OLAF shall be granted suitable access to carry out controls. Financial contributions from Norway to the ISF: provisions are also provided to guarantee the payments of the contribution from Norway to the ISF for the implementation of EU actions and its mid-term review and other specific actions. For the years 2016 to 2018, Norway shall make annual payments to the budget of the ISF-Borders and Visa in the order of EUR 19 777 712. Territorial application: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis. In this regard, the present Agreement with Norway also builds on the Schengen acquis. Denmark shall not take part in the adoption of this decision and will not be bound by it or be subject to its application. The same goes for the United Kingdom and Ireland."
3298EP7,"""""Minimum level of training of seafarers""""",0.684,0.857,0.982,0.613,0.333,0.831,0.872,0.6,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to integrate into EU law the 2010 amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: r ules on training and certification of seafarers have been agreed at an international level by means of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention), adopted in 1978 by conference at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), entered into force in 1984 and significantly amended in 1995. The STCW Convention has been integrated into Union law for the first time by Council Directive 94/58/EC of 22 November 1994 on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Afterwards the EU rules on training and certification of seafarers have been adapted to the subsequent amendments to the Convention, while a common EU mechanism for the recognition of the systems of training and certification of seafarers in the third countries has been set up; lately, the rules of the Union on this matter have through a recast become Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. In 2010 a Conference between the State Parties to the STCW Convention was held in Manila and introduced several significant changes to the Convention, namely on the prevention of fraudulent practices for certificates, in the field of medical standards, in the matter of training on security and with respect to training in technology-related matters. The Manila amendments have also introduced requirements for able seafarers and established new professional profiles, such as electro-technical officers. The Manila amendments to the Convention will enter into force on 1 January 2012. From that date onwards maritime training will have to meet the new requirements. Since the EU Member States are also parties to the Convention, and none of them opposed the Manila amendments, they will have to adapt their legislation to the new text of the Convention. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. As for the proposed directive, the experts of the Member States were consulted on the review exercise in a meeting which was held in Brussels on 3 December 2010. On that occasion the Member States unanimously expressed their wish that the Manila amendments should be integrated into EU law, while they considered that no overhaul of the directive should be carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal is to integrate into EU law the 2010 amendments to the STCW Convention, in order in particular to avoid any conflict between the international and the EU obligations of the Member States. New rules introduced following the Manila amendments : the 2010 amendments regard both the ""Regulations"" annexed to the Convention and the more technical ""Code"", whose Part ""A"", as explained, is mandatory. The main amendments to the Convention, which are reflected in the present proposal, are: strengthened provisions concerning training and assessment, the issuance of certificates of competency, as well as for prevention of fraudulent practices; updated standards relating to medical fitness, fitness for duty as well as alcohol abuse; new requirements concerning certification for able seafarers, for electro-technical officers as well as security-related training for all seafarers; updated requirements for personnel on certain types of ships; clarification and simplification of the definition of ""certificate"". In addition, the proposal has adapted the STCW provisions on watchkeeping, in order to bring them in line with the EU rules on working time for seafarers. Deadline for the recognition of third countries : t he proposal also aims to make more realistic the current three-month deadline for the recognition of third countries currently provided for in Article 19(3) of Directive 2008/106. This deadline shall be extended to 18 months. This provision is about the timeframe available to the Commission to decide on the recognition of a third country following a request by a Member State. Providing the Commission with existing information on certificates : a potential source of accurate data is the certificates and endorsements issued by the national administrations. Currently, under the STCW Convention State Parties are obliged to maintain registers of all certificates and endorsements and the relevant revalidations or other measures affecting them. While this is an important source of data, the different formats used by each Member State do not allow for a complete picture. Therefore, the present proposal foresees a new provision requiring the Member States to provide standardised information to the Commission for the purpose of statistical analysis. The detailed content of such information is presented in a technical annex to the present proposal. Adaptation to the new rules on ""comitology"" : the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced significant changes to the ""comitology"" mechanism. Under the new Treaty the procedure for technical adaptation of the directive is governed by the rules on ""delegated acts"", while the decisions on recognition of third countries by those on ""implementing acts"". The present proposal contains provisions to that effect. Entry into Force and Transitional Arrangements : the amendments to the STCW Convention agreed at Manila will enter into force on 1 January 2012. Since at that point in time the present proposal will not have been adopted yet, it has been foreseen that the proposed directive should enter into force as soon as it is published in the Official Journal. The Manila agreement also includes transitional arrangements. These arrangements allow for the renewal and revalidation of certificates issued before the entry into force of the amended Convention on 1 January 2012. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. If no agreement on the future relationship that covers aviation safety is reached by the end of the transition period, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union will affect in particular the validity of certificates and licenses issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency on behalf of the United Kingdom, or by certain design organisations based in the United Kingdom. Regarding certain aeronautical products (‘type certificates’) and companies (‘organisation approvals’), the United Kingdom resumes, for its jurisdiction as of the end of the transition period, the role of ‘State of design’ under the Convention on International Civil Aviation. It is therefore necessary to develop a controlled transition mechanism, ensuring that the affected products or designs, which were certified by the Agency or a design organisation certified by the Agency before the end of the transition period, can continue to be used in Union aircraft without disruption. CONTENT: the proposal concerns aviation safety and complements Union Regulation (EC) 2018/1139 to deal specifically with the situation entailed by the end of transition period set in the withdrawal agreement in the absence of an agreement covering aviation safety matters applicable by that date. The proposal should allow EU manufacturers to continue production and operators to continue to operate these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. An interruption of these activities would cause serious economic and social difficulties. By ensuring compliance with EU law by the bodies concerned, the proposal should also ensure the protection of consumers and citizens. This Regulation should apply to the certificates listed in the Annex which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by the Agency to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom or by a design organisation having its principal place of business in the United Kingdom. It shall only apply in respect of aircraft registered in the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 provides that the Union budget should continue to support fisheries and maritime affairs policies. Europe's maritime sector employs over 5 million jobs generating almost EUR 500 billion a year, with a potential to create many more jobs. The output of the global ocean economy is estimated at EUR 1.3 trillion and this could more than double by 2030. Fisheries are vital to the livelihood and cultural heritage of many coastal communities in the EU and an essential part of their cultural heritage. Along with aquaculture, it also contributes to food security and nutrition. EU support is a key tool for sustainable fisheries and the conservation of the sea's biological resources, for food security through the supply of seafood, for the growth of a sustainable blue economy and for healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans, notably in the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) for the period 2021-2027. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall be repealed. The new Fund shall support the environmental, economic, social and employment objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), promote the implementation of the Union's maritime policy and support the Union's international commitments in the field of ocean governance. The fund's support shall be based on four priorities: 1. Fostering sustainable fisheries and the conservation of marine biological resources : support from the EMFF shall aim to achieve and maintain sustainable fishing based on the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and to minimise the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem with particular attention to small-scale fishermen. That support shall include innovation and investments in low-impact, climate resilient and low-carbon fishing practices and techniques. Support for fleet adaptation remains sometimes necessary with regard to certain fleet segments and sea basins. Such support should be tightly targeted to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and aimed to achieve balance between the fishing capacity and the available fishing opportunities. 2. Contributing to food security in the Union through competitive and sustainable aquaculture and markets : the EMFF may support the promotion and the sustainable development of aquaculture, including freshwater aquaculture, for the farming of aquatic animals and plants for the production of food and other raw material. Public health actions, aquaculture stock insurance schemes and animal health and welfare actions shall also be eligible. 3. Enabling the growth of a sustainable blue economy and fostering prosperous coastal communities : the fund shall support community-led local development under shared management to stimulate economic diversification in a local context through the development of coastal and inland fisheries, aquaculture and a sustainable blue economy. It shall also support the collection, management and use of data to improve knowledge of the state of the marine environment. 4. Strengthening international ocean governance and enabling safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans : the EU plays a leading role in particular in preventing, deterring and eradicating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, improving the international framework for ocean governance, reducing pressures on oceans and seas, creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy and strengthening international ocean research and data. The EMFF shall support these international commitments and objectives under direct management. The EMFF shall also contribute to achieving the Union's environmental objectives in the light of the Commission's proposal to increase the total share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25%. Simplification : under the proposal, the EMFF beyond 2020 shall evolve towards a simplified architecture. Its effectiveness shall be improved by (i) allowing Member States to target support based on their strategic priorities; (ii) better targeting of support for the CFP; and (iii) better alignment with other EU funds since the rules applicable to all structural and investment funds are laid down in a Common Provisions Regulation. In concrete terms, the EMFF shall co-finance projects alongside national funding streams with each Member State receiving a share of the total budget. Member States would prepare their national operational programmes indicating how they intend to spend the funds. Once these programmes have been approved by the Commission, the national authorities would decide which projects they wish to finance. Proposed budget : the proposed overall budget for the EMFF amounts, in current prices, to EUR 6.14 billion, of which (i) EUR 5.31 billion allocated to support under shared management by the Member States through EMFF programmes based on national strategies and (ii) EUR 829 million to direct management. Concerning shared management, after having deducted the value of the UK programme (EUR 243 million), Member States would retain, in nominal terms, 96.5% of their 2014-2020 allocation. In order to ensure stability in particular with regard to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, the definition of national allocations will be based on the 2014-2020 shares."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative complements the Commission's proposal of 13 March 2020 for specific measures to mobilise investment in Member States' healthcare systems and other sectors of their economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative), as well as all other measures to address the current unprecedented situation. In view of the deep and worsening negative impact on EU economies and societies, the Commission considers it necessary to grant Member States exceptional additional flexibility to enable them to respond to this crisis by strengthening the possibility to mobilise all unused aid from the Funds. The proposal follows extensive consultations with Member States and the European Parliament in recent weeks and takes into account the more than 200 questions of clarification and advice received from national authorities on their handling of crisis response measures through the Coronavirus Investment Initiative Task Force. CONTENT: the proposal aims to introduce extraordinary flexibility to allow maximum mobilization of all unused aid from the European Structural and Investment Funds. This flexibility would be provided by: - the possibility of temporarily granting, for the implementation of cohesion policy programmes for the financial year 2020-2021, a 100% co-financing rate from the EU budget; - additional transfer possibilities between the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund, as well as between categories of regions; -the introduction of some flexibility in terms of thematic concentration, to allow Member States to redirect resources to the areas most affected by the current crisis; - the relaxation of certain obligations for Member States, where these entail an administrative burden that could delay the implementation of measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic; - the simplification of procedural requirements related to audits and financial instruments; - the possibilities for the support for working capital through financial instruments should be extended to the EAFRD. Lastly, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 to allow for ERDF support to be provided for undertakings in difficulties in these specific circumstances, thus ensuring consistency with the approach taken under the Temporary Framework for State Aid Measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak and with rules for the granting of de minimis aid.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: China is among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the Schengen area. EU citizens also need a visa to enter China. In the context of the EU-China Mobility and Migration Dialogue established in October 2013, the European Union and China agreed on a cooperation package comprising measures in the area of irregular migration and visa policy that would be negotiated or implemented in two interdependent phases: On 14 September 2015 the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China for a short-stay visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic passports and addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations were opened on 21 September. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators of the EU and China respectively on 3 and 4 November 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and China on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports. The main provisions of the proposal may be summarised as follows: Purpose and scope: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for citizens of the European Union holding a valid diplomatic passport or an EU laissez-passer and for citizens of China holding a valid diplomatic passport when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that China may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom and Ireland are therefore not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application. Duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as these Member States ((currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania) are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the Chinese holders of diplomatic passports to stay for 90 days in any 180-day period on the territory of each of those Member States, independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Visits by high officials: the agreement stipulates that officials at or above vice-ministerial level of the central government and officers of or above the rank of major general of the armed forces must inform the competent authorities of the country to be visited through diplomatic channels before they travel to its territory for official purposes. Exchange of specimens: the agreement provides for the exchange of specimens of diplomatic passports and the EU laissez-passer no later than 90 days after the date of signature of the agreement. Territorial application: the agreement clarifies that the visa waiver for Chinese holders of diplomatic passports only applies to the European territories of France and the Netherlands. Joint declarations: a joint declaration on the interpretation of the period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. In addition to the joint declaration, two other joint declarations are attached to the agreement regarding: The agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the agreement whose tasks include, among others, the monitoring of its implementation as well as suggesting amendments or additions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2001, all the rules on production, marketing, distribution and use were consolidated in a veterinary medicines code (Directive 2001/82/EC); this was followed by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The current EU legislation on veterinary medicinal products provides the legal environment on authorisation, production, marketing, distribution and use of veterinary medicinal products. It brought some harmonisation to the procedures and rules required to place veterinary medicinal products on the EU market. However, the Commission considers that there is evidence that the existing provisions do not deliver a functioning internal market: diverging or incomplete transposition of the rules and the existence of numerous national requirements imply that companies are confronted with different rules and interpretation in countries and have also led to different levels of public and animal health protection; that needs of the veterinary sector differ substantially from those of the human sector in relation to medicines: in the veterinary sector there are many different animal species, which creates both a fragmented market and the need for major investments in order to extend the authorisation of medicines existing for one animal species to another; the price-setting mechanisms in the veterinary sector follow a completely different logic. Consequently, prices for veterinary medicines are typically substantially lower than for medicinal products for human use; the size of the animal pharmaceutical industry is only a small fraction of the size of the pharmaceutical industry for human medicines. The Commission considers that it is critically important to have a single market for veterinary medicinal products. The current confined and fragmented markets do not allow the pharmaceutical sector to have a positive return on investments for developing new products for certain animal species. The ambition to improve the availability of medicines in the Union and the functioning of the internal market and market competition can only be carried out at EU level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commission’s Impact Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013. CONTENT: the revision of Directive 2001/82/EC and other legislation on veterinary medicinal products seek to put in place, while safeguarding public health, animal health, food safety and the environment, an up-to-date, proportionate body of legislation tailored to the specificities of the veterinary sector. Specific objectives aim to: expand the market beyond the top four animal species, simplify procedures for obtaining a marketing authorisation in multiple national markets, review data requirements in marketing authorisation procedures, simplify post authorisation requirements, review incentives for breakthrough medicines. The proposal also tackles the issue of antimicrobial resistance and introduces provisions to minimise risks to public health arising from the use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU. The additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of implementing acts. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 epidemic crisis is hampering growth in the Member States, exacerbating the severe liquidity shortages resulting from the sharp and sudden increase in public investment needed in their health systems and other sectors of their economies. This creates an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed by specific measures. The lack of public funds in Member States should not hamper investments under programmes supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF), as well as the European Fund for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (EFFAMP), which are necessary to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to release funds to fight the crisis, it is necessary to rapidly mobilise cash reserves from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESF) - the money available to the EU under the Cohesion Fund. This would make financial means available to Member States' budgets without delay. CONTENT: the Commission proposes a ‘Coronavirus response investment initiative’ to promote investment by mobilising the cash reserves available in the European Structural and Investment Funds to tackle this crisis without delay. Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 , (EU) No 1301/2013 and (EU) No 508/2014 would be amended accordingly. The proposed investment initiative consists of the following elements: Mobilisation of EUR 37 billion of European public investment The investments shall be sizeable and shall rapidly reach more than EUR 37 billion. To achieve this, the Commission proposes to release about EUR 8 billion of investment liquidity. In order to quickly direct these EUR 37 billion of European public investment to address the consequences of the coronavirus crisis, the Commission proposes to relinquish this year’s obligation to request refunding of unspent pre-financing for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) until programme closure. Member States should normally have reimbursed by the end of June 2020 a total of around EUR 8 billion of unused pre-financing received for 2019. They should now be allowed to keep this money. Taking into account the average co-financing rates among Member States, this EUR 8 billion would, in combination with co-financing from the EU budget of around EUR 29 billion, mobilise a total EU budget support of EUR 37 billion. Flexibility in applying EU spending rules In order to provide more flexibility in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, it is proposed to give more flexibility to Member States in programme implementation of programmes and to provide for a simplified procedure not requiring a Commission decision in case of modifications to operational programmes. In order to respond to the impact of the crisis: - financial instruments financed by the Funds should also provide support in the form of working capital to SMEs if necessary as a temporary measure to provide an effective response to a public health crisis; - the ERDF investment priority to strengthen research, technological development and innovation can cover investment in products and services necessary for fostering the crisis response capacities in health services; - the EMFF to safeguard the income of aquaculture producers by contributing to an aquaculture stock insurance covering economic losses due to a public health crisis. In order to provide an immediate response to the impact of the crisis, expenditure for operations for fostering crisis response capacities should be eligible as of 1 February 2020. A Task Force has been setup to coordinate work with Member States, identify their precise needs and assist them so as to ensure that the money starts flowing as soon as possible. The proposed amendment does not entail any change in the annual ceilings of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework for commitments and payments. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund remains unchanged. The proposal shall facilitate the acceleration of the programme implementation resulting in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission shall carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts. The non-recovered amounts in 2020 shall be cleared at programme closure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the challenges that need to be tackled by external action have increased in recent years: regional conflicts, terrorism, economic inequalities and growing migratory pressures, demographic growth and environmental degradation. At the same time, while poverty levels have declined globally, the number of people living in poverty continues to be a major problem, including in emerging economies. For the next long-term EU budget for the period 2021-2027, the European Commission proposes to increase investment in external actions, to restructure the Union's external action instruments and to integrate the European Development Fund (EDF) into the EU budget in order to ensure greater coherence, to benefit from effective cooperation, to simplify procedures and to achieve economies of scale. The proposed neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument (NDICI) is designed to uphold and promote the Union’s values and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of its external action. It shall be the EU's main instrument for assisting its partners in their political and economic change towards sustainable development, stability, consolidation of democracy, socio-economic development and poverty eradication. The proposal provides a framework for the implementation of external action policies and international obligations that include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and UN Security Council Resolution 2282 (2016) on sustaining peace. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument programme for the period 2021-2027. It also establishes the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (the EFSD+) and an external action guarantee. The neighbourhood and international cooperation instrument shall be based on three pillars: a geographical pillar to cover planned cooperation with neighbouring countries and all other third countries. This component shall bring together geographical programmes for the European Neighbourhood, for sub-Saharan Africa, for Asia and the Pacific, and for the Americas and the Caribbean to jointly address global challenges such as human development, including gender equality, climate change; a thematic pillar (achieving common goals), which addresses global issues and/or policy flagship initiatives through specific programmes focusing on human rights and democracy, civil society organisations, stability and peace. a ‘rapid response’ pillar which is dedicated to quick response capacity for crisis management and conflict prevention, as well as strengthening the resilience of states, societies, communities and individuals, the link between humanitarian aid and development actions, and early action to meet other foreign policy objectives. Flexibility reserve : building on the successful experience of the European Development Fund (EDF), an amount should remain unallocated as an emerging challenges and priorities cushion. The cushion shall be used primarily to address migration pressures, but also stability and security needs, unforeseen events and new international initiatives and priorities. New European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) : the EFSD+ shall be an integrated financial mechanism providing financing capacity worldwide in the form of grants, budget guarantees and financial instruments. The EDFD+ shall support the external investment plan and combine blending and budget guarantee operations covered by the external action guarantee, including those covering sovereign risks associated with lending operations previously carried out under the external lending mandate to the European Investment Bank. General principles : the following principles shall apply to the instrument as a whole: democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, rights-based approach, cooperation, dialogue, partnership, development effectiveness, consideration of climate change, environmental protection and gender equality. The proposal also provides for an obligation to inform the European Parliament and to exchange information regularly with it. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the instrument for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 89.2 billion in current prices. EUR 7 billion for thematic programmes : (i) EUR 1.5 billion for human rights and democracy; (ii) EUR 1.5 billion for civil society organisations; (iii) EUR 1 billion for stability and peace; (iv) EUR 3 billion for global challenges; The cushion for emerging challenges and priorities amounting to EUR 10.2 billion may also be used."

BACKGROUND: this Commission proposal concerns the review of the list of priority substances (PS) in the field of water policy, i.e. the chemicals identified among those presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment at EU level which are listed in Annex X to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC. The revision takes place following the review of priority substances required by both the WFD and the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (EQSD) 2008/105/EC. In the course of reviewing the priority substances list, improvements in the functioning of the EQSD were identified, as well as a mechanism for improving the identification of additional priority substances in future reviews. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t echnical work on the review of the PS list began in 2007 and was supported by an extensive consultation with experts from the Commission services, Member States, stakeholders and the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER). As the technical work was in its final stages in 2010, work on the impact assessment began with the commencement of a study by the consultancy Entec. The Impact Assessment Board discussed the Impact Assessment report at its meeting on 22 June 2011. The comments made were addressed in the accompanying Impact Assessment report. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the proposal is limited to the identification of priority substances and to establishing EQS at EU level. The main amendments are as follows: Amendments to Annex X of the WFD : the updated Annex X includes the newly proposed priority substances and identifies two existing priority substances as priority hazardous substances. The new list is comprised of the following: Plant protection product substances: Aclonifen, Bifenox, Cypermethrin, Dicofol, Heptachlor, Quinoxyfen Substances used in biocidal products: Cybutryne, Dichlorvos, Terbutryn Industrial chemicals: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) Combustion by-products: Dioxin and Dioxin-Like PCBs Pharmaceutical substances: 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), Diclofenac. Amendments to EQSD : the main amendments are as follows: New Annex for priority substances and biota : Part A of Annex I is replaced by Annex II to this Directive. The latter introduces the newly proposed priority substances, amends the EQS for some of the existing priority substances and introduces a column for biota standards. This latter column includes the three biota standards that were already established by EQSD as well as biota standards for some other existing priority substances and some new priority substances. Listing the biota standards in Annex I of the EQSD simplifies presentation and improves clarity. Matrix : a definition of “matrix” is introduced i.e. the environmental compartment to which the EQS apply and in which the concentrations of priority substances and priority hazard substances are therefore to be monitored: usually water, sediment or biota (fish unless otherwise stated). The text is amended to make it coherent with the new structure of Part A of Annex I (in particular with the inclusion of biota standards in the Annex), and to amend the obligations of Member States as regards the selection of the matrix for monitoring. A default monitoring matrix is specified for each substance, on the basis of its intrinsic properties. The existing flexibility for Member States to choose an alternative matrix is retained, but it is now conditional on the fulfilment of the minimum analytical performance criteria in Article 4 of Commission Directive 2009/90/EC11. Notification : the notification obligations set out in the EQSD are integrated into the reporting of the river basin management plans under the WFD. Comitology : the comitology mandate to amend paragraph 3 of Part B of Annex I is aligned to the new delegated powers under Article 290 of the Treaty. Furthermore, changes are made to the text to align it with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on Commission implementing powers. PBT substances : persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs) and other substances that behave like PBTs may be found for decades in the aquatic environment at levels posing a significant risk, even if extensive measures to reduce or eliminate emissions have already been taken. A new provision is inserted that makes specific provision for substances behaving as ubiquitous persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances. Watch list : a new provision is inserted to establish a watch list for the targeted collection of monitoring data to support future reviews of the priority substances list. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal contains no budgetary implications."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union, in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner (EU ETS). Aviation activities were included in the EU emissions trading system by Directive 2008/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. Considering current and projected emissions from the aviation sector, and in the context of an enhanced climate ambition of the EU for 2030, the climate contribution needs to be significantly strengthened, also with a view to allow for the necessary contribution to the EU climate neutrality by 2050. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission introduces amendments to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) legislation in relation to its application to aviation to ensure that: - aviation contributes to the 2030 emissions reduction target in accordance with the European Green Deal; - the EU ETS is amended as appropriate in respect of the ICAO’s Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation; and - allocation of emission allowances in respect of aviation is revised to increase auctioning. The proposal makes amendments to Directive 2003/87/EC in order to: - consolidate the total quantity of allowances for aviation at the level of allocation/auctioning for intra-European flights and departing flights from EEA airports to Switzerland and the UK. The allocation for year 2024 will be based on the total allocation to active aircraft operators in 2023. The total number of aviation allowances in the ETS will be capped at current levels and be reduced annually by 4.2% (linear reduction factor). The number of free allowances allocated to aircraft operators will be reduced progressively, with the aim of stopping free allocation to aviation by the end of 2026; - include a time-limited derogation from the EU ETS for emissions from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region of a Member State and an aerodrome located in the same Member State; - allows delegated acts to be adopted to supplement this Directive concerning the detailed arrangements for the auctioning by Member States of aviation allowances should include the modalities for the transfer of a share of revenues to the Union budget; - delete the provisions on free allocation rules to aircraft operators are no longer needed after the transition to full auctioning; - allow the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to apply to emissions from EU-based airlines for flights to and from countries outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. When emissions from flights outside the EEA reach levels higher than those in 2019, they will have to be offset by corresponding carbon offsets; - provide for EU-based airlines to use appropriate international credits for compliance for flights to or from third countries that are applying CORSIA; - ensure that fights to and from most Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States not implementing CORSIA would be exempt from EU ETS or CORSIA obligations without end date for the exemption. In parallel to these amendments to the EU ETS Directive, a separate proposal is being made to implement Member State notification to EU-based airlines of zero CORSIA offsetting for the year 2021. The separate proposal relates to CORSIA-related aspects that should be in place by November 2022, for notification of zero additional offsetting to take place by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 of 21 January 2002 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. The new proposed Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020, proposing among other things, a new Fiscalis 2020 programme. The smooth functioning of taxation systems in the internal market is dependent on effective and efficient processing of cross-border transactions by national tax administrations, the prevention of and fight against tax fraud and protection of tax revenues. This implies exchange of large quantities of information between tax administrations, but also tax administrations working more efficiently and at the same time reducing the administrative, economic and time burden for tax payers involved in cross-border activities. This can only be achieved on the basis of cooperation between tax administrations of the Member States and third parties. Given the increasing globalisation, an efficient fight against fraud should equally have an international dimension. Therefore, the programme will also support the exchange of information with non-Member States in the realm of the international agreements concluded with the non-Member States concerned. The proposed programme is the successor programme of the Fiscalis 2013 programme, which ends on 31 December 2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : considering the overall policy context and problems ahead for customs in the next decade, a number of policy options has been analysed and compared: Option 1: baseline: continuing the programme with the current objectives and design. Option 2: no continuation of the programme. Option 3: upgrade the baseline: this option would encompass the baseline scenario tailoring the objectives to the future challenges. It puts additional focus on the fight against tax fraud, avoidance and evasion, working towards a more efficient tax administration, addressing the high administrative burden for taxpayers and tax administrations and considering the cooperation with third countries and third parties. Option 4: upgrade and cater for new policies: besides addressing the problems described under the Option 3 "", this policy option would offer the means to extend cooperation to new areas that may follow from policy evolution. The impact assessment identified Option 3 ""Upgrade the baseline"" as the preferred option. It is in line with the proposal for a new budget for Europe 2020 and scores best on acceptability by Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 114, 197 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Regulation proposes to establish a multi-annual action programme ""Fiscalis 2020"" covering the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. Scope: the proposed Fiscalis 2020 programme will support tax cooperation in the Union clustered around human networking and competency building, on the one hand, and IT capacity building on the other hand. The first cluster allows for the exchange of good practices and operational knowledge amongst the Member States and other countries participating in the programme. The latter enables the programme to fund appropriate IT infrastructure and systems that allow tax administrations in the Union to evolve to fully-fledged e-administrations. The scope of the programme has been brought in line with recent Union tax legislation meaning that it will not only cover VAT, excise duties and taxes on income and capital but also other taxes which are subject of Union tax legislation. The programme will be open to participation by Member States, candidate countries and potential candidates. Countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy will also have the option of taking part in the programme under certain conditions. External experts may also participate in specific actions (e.g. representatives of other authorities, trade, national and international organisations, and possibly other experts), if required to realise the programme objectives. Objectives: these address the problems identified and challenges expected for tax policy and European authorities in the next decade. The specific objective of the programme shall be to improve the operation of the taxation systems, in particular through cooperation between participating countries, their tax authorities, their officials and external experts. The programme will have the following priorities: to support the preparation, coherent application and effective implementation of Union tax law; to fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, in particular by enhancing effective and efficient administrative cooperation and exchange of information to contribute to the reduction of administrative burden on tax administrations and compliance costs for taxpayers to work towards efficient tax administration, in particular as regards tax compliance, and administrative capacity of tax administrations. to enhance a coherent application and implementation of Union tax policy; to enhance cooperation with international organisations, other governmental authorities, third countries, economic operators and their organisations with a view to fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance. The main added value of the programme is generated by enhancing the capacity of Member States in fighting fraud and possibly raising revenue, while cutting costs in developing the tools for these purposes. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the timing of the review of EU funding programmes is linked to the proposal for a new Multiannual Financial Framework . In accordance with that proposal, this Regulation on the Fiscalis 2020 programme contains a budgetary framework of EUR 234 370 000 (in current prices) for the period of 2014-2020. The Fiscalis 2020 programme will be implemented by means of a direct central management mode and in a priority-based manner. Work programmes are established –together with the stakeholders- stipulating the priorities for a specific period."
4420EP7,"""""Further macro-financial assistance for Georgia""""",0.684,0.751,0.789,0.226,0.273,0.723,0.733,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to propose further macro-financial assistance for Georgia, in the amount of EUR 46 million. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: The EU completed in early August 2010 the disbursement of a EUR 46 million macrofinancial assistance (MFA) operation to Georgia approved by the Council in November 2009. The assistance, which was provided in the form of grants, was part of a pledge of two possible MFA operations of the same amount made by the European Commission at the International Donors' Conference of October 2008. The approval of the second MFA was conditional on the continued existence of external financing needs over and above those covered by the IMF arrangement. In a letter from 10 May 2010, the Georgian Minister of Finance requested the activation of the second part of the Commission pledge of EU funds, amounting to EUR 46 million, which is the subject of this proposal. The Commission considers that the activation of the second part of the MFA pledged in 2008 is warranted. Although the Georgian economy is recovering (following the double shock caused by the military conflict with Russia of August 2008 and the global financial crisis), the balance of payments and budgetary position remain weak and vulnerable. The new MFA would contribute to help Georgia to address the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis. The new MFA will support the economic reform agenda of the government. It would reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance would also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management, as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the MFA and the economic adjustment and reform programme attached to it will help alleviate Georgia's short-term financing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening medium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability, raising sustainable growth and promoting economic integration and regulatory convergence with the EU. It will also help improve the efficiency and transparency of public finance management, building on the positive impact of the previous MFA operation in the country. MFA will also support the macroeconomic stabilisation and structural policies of the programme agreed with the IMF. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the TFEU. CONTENT: the EU shall make the MFA available to Georgia for a total maximum amount of EUR 46 million, half of which will be provided as grants and half as loans. The assistance will contribute to cover Georgia's residual external financing needs in 2009-2011, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance will be disbursed in 2011 in two equal instalments, each of them consisting of a grant and a loan element. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be taken into account. The main points are as follows: the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2011; the second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the third quarter of 2011; as is usual with the MFA instrument, the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement; in addition, the Commission and the Georgian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. In the context of the previous MFA operations, the Commission services have worked closely with the Georgian authorities on public finance management (PFM) reforms that aim at establishing a more transparent, coherent and accountable PFM system; in the new MFA operation, the scope of the policy conditionality would be enlarged, notably to measures aimed at fostering the economic and financial integration as well as regulatory harmonisation with the EU in selected areas, under the ENP Action Plan and taking into account the new context created by the plan to conclude an Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia; the new MFA would be exceptional and limited in time and is intended to run in parallel to the SBA. It will complement support from international and bilateral donors; the proposal includes a sunset clause. The proposed MFA would be made available for 2.5 years starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Following the successful implementation of the last MFA, in which the Georgian authorities demonstrated the political will and the capacity to implement structural reforms, the Commission believes that also this second MFA operation would contribute to the implementation of the government's agenda of structural reforms. The conditions will be consistent with the priorities of the EU-Georgia ENP Action Plan. The decision to disburse half of the proposed assistance in grants and the other half in loans is justified by Georgia’s level of development (as measured by its per capital income) and debt indicators, and the recent improvement in the country's economic situation. The full use of grants in the previous operation had to be understood as an exceptional decision justified by the very difficult circumstances Georgia found itself in late 2008. The blend of grants and loans is also consistent with the fact that Georgia has been a blend country for the World Bank since January 2009. For the forthcoming World Bank operations, the country is expected to receive one third of the World Bank assistance in the form of the IDA lending, while two thirds of the assistance are expected to be provided on IBRD terms. The new MFA will reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation over the medium-term. The assistance will also promote policy measures to strengthen public finance management (building on those of the previous operation and of the EU's sectoral budgetary support operation), as well as measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the grant element of the assistance of EUR 23 million would be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2011 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), with payments taking place in 2011. In line with the Guarantee Fund Regulation, the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund is expected to take place in 2013 and to amount to a maximum of EUR 2.1 million. This corresponds to 9% of the EUR 23 million loan expected to be disbursed in 2011."
3083EP7,"""""Energy efficiency""""",0.86,0.886,0.895,0.419,0.303,0.88,0.867,0.714,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to ensure the objective of achieving 20% primary energy savings in 2020 and to prepare the way for new improvements in energy efficiency beyond that date. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: energy efficiency is one of the key features of the flagship initiative “ A resource-efficient Europe ” announced in the Europe 2020 strategy. Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and fastest way to increase security of supply, and is an effective way to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions responsible for climate change. As outlined in the Commission Communication “ A Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 ”, energy efficiency can help the EU achieve and even outperform its greenhouse gas emission reduction target. The EU has set itself the objective of achieving 20% primary energy savings in 2020. The Commission’s latest estimations suggest that the EU will achieve only half of the 20% target in 2020. The current framework which governs energy efficiency, in particular Directive 2006/32/EC on energy services and Directive 2004/8/EC on cogeneration, has failed to fully tap the energy saving potential. The measures already adopted at Member State level are also insufficient to overcome the remaining obstacles on markets and in regulation. The European Council and the European Parliament have called on the Commission to adopt a new ambitious strategy in the area of energy efficiency for determined action to tap the considerable potential. To give fresh momentum to energy efficiency, on 8 March 2011 the Commission put forward a new Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) setting out measures to achieve further savings in energy supply and use. This legislative proposal transforms certain aspects of the EEP into binding measures. It also looks beyond the 20% target and seeks to set a common framework to promote energy efficiency in the Union beyond 2020. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment explores a series of options broken down into three levels: First-level policy options analyse ways to improve the current policy framework. This analysis focuses primarily on issues of whether the current approach of the ESD to target setting should be extended until 2020, whether national energy savings targets should be added to achieve the EU 20 % target and if so, whether they should be binding or merely indicative. The analysis concludes that the ESD targets should be maintained for end-use sectors until their deadline in 2016, but to reach the 20 % energy efficiency target they need to be complemented with more ambitious energy savings targets under the Europe 2020 process. Second-level policy options explore different measures to tackle the remaining economic potential on the demand and supply side. The IA looks at energy savings obligation schemes as a possible option for yielding energy savings in end-use sectors. Another set of policy options examine measures involving the public sector. Other options with a considerable positive impact compared to their costs are those that aim to promote the energy services market, provide improved and more frequent information to households and companies on their actual energy consumption through billing and smart meters, and mandatory energy audits for large companies. Other options to promote energy efficiency via voluntary measures are assessed as insufficient to tap all the available potential for savings. The IA also analyses which measures could help tap energy efficiency potential in energy transformation and distribution, as well as options for national reporting and monitoring of implementation. Third-level policy options assess the legal form of the selected first- and second-level measures. It concludes that, in order to reach the level of ambition of the EU 20% energy efficiency target, EU policies need to reap the energy saving potential in every sector, including in those sectors excluded from the scope of the ESD. This is why it is proposed to adopt a new legislative proposal that covers the scope of the two Directives and extends it to all sectors with energy saving potential. LEGAL BASIS: Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive establishes a common framework for promoting energy efficiency in the Union to ensure the target of 20 % primary energy savings by 2020 is met and to pave the way for further energy efficiency afterwards. It lays down rules designed to remove barriers and overcome some of the market failures that impede efficiency in the supply and use of energy. End-use sectors : the proposed Directive focuses on measures that lay down requirements on the public sector, both as regards renovating the buildings it owns and applying high energy efficiency standards to the purchase of buildings, products and services. requires Member States to establish national energy efficiency obligation schemes; requires regular mandatory energy audits for large companies and lays down a series of requirements on energy companies regarding metering and billing. Energy supply sector : the proposal requires Member States: to adopt national heating and cooling plans to develop the potential for high-efficiency generation and efficient district heating and cooling, and to ensure that spatial planning regulations are in line with these plans; to adopt authorisation criteria that ensure that installations are located in sites close to heat demand points and that all new electricity generation installations and existing installations that are substantially refurbished are equipped with high-efficiency CHP units. Member States should however be able to lay down conditions for exemption from this obligation where certain conditions are met; to establish an inventory of energy efficiency data for installations undertaking the combustion of fuels or the refining of mineral oil and gas. The proposal also sets requirements on priority/guaranteed access to the grid, priority dispatch of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration and the connection of new industrial plants producing waste heat to district or cooling networks. Other measures proposed include efficiency requirements for national energy regulatory authorities, information and awareness-raising actions, requirements concerning the availability of certification schemes, action to promote the development of energy services, and an obligation for Member States to remove obstacles to energy efficiency, notably the split of incentives between the owner and tenant of a building or among building owners. Lastly, the proposal provides for the establishment of national energy efficiency targets for 2020 and requires the Commission to assess in 2014 whether the Union can achieve its target of 20% primary energy savings by 2020. The Commission is required to submit its assessment to the European Parliament and the Council, followed, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal laying down mandatory national targets. It should be noted that the scope of two Directives: the Cogeneration Directive (2004/8/EC, CHP Directive) and the Energy Services Directive (2006/32/EC, ESD) overlap with this proposal. It is therefore proposed that these two Directives are repealed when the new Directive enters into force, except for Articles 4(1) to (4) and Annexes I, III and IV to the ESD. These provisions concern the achievement by 2017 of an indicative energy saving target of 9% of the final energy consumption of each Member State in the 5 years before the implementation of the ESD. This target – albeit different in scope and level of ambition - contributes to the realisation of the EU's 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, and should therefore remain applicable until 2017. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Directive will be implemented using the existing budget and will not have an impact on the multi-annual financial framework. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions giving the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
5135EP7,"""""European satellite navigation systems""""",0.912,0.905,0.018,0.548,0.545,0.952,0.908,0.343,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to propose a new financial and governance framework concerning the two European satellite radio navigation programmes, Galileo and EGNOS (GPS signal augmentation) for the period 2014-2020. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 defines the framework for the public governance and financing of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. In particular, it allocates EUR 3405 million for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. As provided for in the Regulation, the Commission adopted a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the mid-term review of the European satellite navigation programmes on 18 January 2011. As a result of this report, the Council, among other things, expressed its support once again for the European satellite navigation programmes as defined in Regulation (EC) No 683/2008. It also noted the overall cost estimates and the fact that the Commission would submit a proposal including changes to the governance model with a view to the next multiannual financial framework. For its part, in its resolution adopted on 8 June 2011, the Parliament also restated its support for the European satellite navigation programmes and considered that it should be principally funded by the Union budget. It asked the Commission to submit legislative proposals quickly with particular emphasis on the need to provide a long-term, stable framework, in particular for operation of the systems. In its Communication dated 29 June 2011, accompanied by a proposal for a Council Regulation of the same date, the Commission proposed to assign EUR 7 000 million to the financing of the European satellite navigation programmes during the next multiannual financial framework for the 2014-2020 period. Nevertheless, it indicated here that it is necessary to maintain efforts to control costs and that new management procedures should be planned for the long-term. It should be noted that this sum of EUR 7 000 million, at 2011 constant prices, is an absolute ceiling and corresponds to a sum of EUR 7 897 million at current prices. The Commission recalls that it should be borne in mind that the Galileo and EGNOS programmes are flagship projects of the Union and fit in perfectly with the Europe 2020 strategy and policies for sustainable development. It should also be emphasised that the European satellite navigation programmes does not only concern the Member States with the greatest involvement in the space field: they concern all the Member States of the Union directly. As part of Europe 2020's f lagship initiative 'An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era' the Commission is responsible for developing an effective space policy to provide the tools to address some of the key global challenges and in particular to deliver Galileo. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on the continued implementation of the programmes and on two particular key problems: i) firstly, the configuration of future services, given that the budget allocated for the period 2008-2013 is insufficient to complete the infrastructure of the system established under the Galileo programme and to ensure the operation of EGNOS; and ii) the definition of the operational governance model and the financing required. concerning the system established under the Galileo programme, evaluation of the various options has shown that the best option is to retain the services initially specified, with the exception of the (Safety of Life) SoL service. This solution, which requires less infrastructure on the ground, reduces the costs; with regard to EGNOS, the system is already operational and many users are enjoying its benefits. In addition, when the SoL service was declared operational, the Commission gave assurances regarding the continuity of this service to users who went on to make significant investments. Ending the EGNOS programme is not an option in this context. On the second point , the impact assessment concluded that the Commission, representing the Union, should remain responsible for the programmes while the Union continues to ensure their funding alone, as proposed by the Commission. LEGAL BASIS: Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: The proposed Regulation meets the requests of the Parliament and the Council while taking into account the contents of the Commission Communication of 29 June 2011. It is the basic act for European satellite navigation programmes for the period covered by the next multiannual financial framework, providing in particular for funding and the governance model for the programmes. Given the magnitude of the changes to be made to Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, it was deemed necessary to propose that it be replaced with a new Regulation rather than amended. The Commission proposes to earmark EUR 7 000 million (EUR 7 897 million in current prices) to guarantee the completion of the EU satellite navigation infrastructure and to ensure the exploitation of the systems until 2020, such as the operations of the space and terrestrial infrastructures, the necessary replenishment/replacement activities, certification procedures, and notably the provision of services. The proposal also recalls that the Union remains the owner of the systems. Therefore the management of the programmes' exploitation should be delegated to the European GNSS Agency while management of the programmes' deployment should be delegated to the European Space Agency. In order to enable the European Parliament and the Council to gain a full picture of the conditions under which the European GNSS Agency would be obliged to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under the new governance model, particularly concerning resources, the Commission will submit a proposal in 2012 for the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 and of the associated financial statement. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the Union will continue to finance the Galileo and EGNOS programmes alone. Its contribution to the programmes for the period 2014-2020 shall not exceed EUR 7 897 million at current prices. It covers three main activities, namely, completion of the deployment phase of the Galileo programme, the exploitation phase of the same programme and operation of the EGNOS system. The latter includes ongoing improvement of the services provided by the system in order to meet the changing needs of users. Retaining the expertise acquired within the Commission is an essential factor in ensuring the continuity of the programmes. Consequently, the Commission will retain temporary agents currently in employment for periods to be determined in accordance with the various phases of the programmes and will transfer personnel to the European GNSS Agency. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: an Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat between Denmark, Norway and Sweden was signed on 19 December 1966. It remained in force for an initial period of 35 years until 2002 and was subsequently extended for two five-year periods until 2012. This agreement allowed for reciprocal access between those three countries to fish up to 4 nautical miles from their respective baselines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, which are the waters between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It established that, for the purposes of such fishing, the area in question was deemed to constitute the high seas. In view of more recent developments in international fisheries law, Norway considered that the existing agreement was not in conformity with the current provisions of the Law of the Sea. Norway was particularly concerned with regard to the provisions on control. On 29 July 2009, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry formally informed the Danish authorities that they wished to terminate the Agreement with a formal denunciation. Consequently, the Agreement expired on 7 August 2012. Subsequently, Norway entered into formal negotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, with the aim of establishing a replacement Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area. This new Agreement was signed on 15 January 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden on behalf of the Union. The new Agreement: The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development."
10181EP8,"""""Programme implementing Horizon Europe""""",0.829,0.855,1.0,0.812,0.212,0.881,0.822,0.5,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe - the framework programme for research and innovation. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while the proposal for a Regulation establishing the framework programme for research and innovation ‘Horizon Europe’ for the period 2021-2027 sets out the general and specific objectives of Horizon Europe, the structure and the broad lines of activities to be carried out, this proposal for a Decision aims to define the operational objectives and the activities which are specific to parts of Horizon Europe. The Horizon Europe proposal is in line with the Commission proposal on the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The proposal is framed by the premise that research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values, and enabling solutions that address challenges in a more systemic way. CONTENT: the proposal for a Decision seeks to establish the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe - the framework programme for research and innovation. It lays down the operational objectives of the specific programme, the budget for the period 2021 – 2027, the rules for implementation of the specific programme and activities to be carried out under this programme. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ includes five thematic clusters that address the full spectrum of global challenges through top-down collaborative R&I activities: (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. A small number of missions with specific goals will be launched from within the pillar. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ which essentially consists of: (i) scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation through a new European Innovation Council; (ii) activities aiming at enhancing and developing the overall European innovation landscape, including support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). Strategic planning : the implementation of Horizon Europe shall be steered by an inclusive and transparent strategic planning process of the research and innovation activities the programme will fund. The strategic planning exercise shall lay out a multiannual strategy for the development of work programme content, though it will remain sufficiently flexible to respond rapidly to unexpected needs and crises. This proposal lays down specific provisions for the programming and implementation of the framework programme, in particular for: (1) Missions (under the global issues and industrial competitiveness pillar ): these missions shall be co-designed and decided as part of the Horizon Europe strategic planning process, which shall include collaboration between the relevant Commission services, Member States, the European Parliament and relevant stakeholders. The first few missions shall be introduced in the first strategic planning exercise. Based on the first two years' experience, the number and scale of missions may be increased in subsequent work programmes. Whilst the duration of the Union support to missions shall not be expected to exceed 10 years and shall be subject to regular review (through the work programme cycle), the timeframe for expected impact of missions may spread out beyond this timeframe. For co-designing the missions and steering their implementation, the Commission may set up mission boards whose members shall be appointed by the Commission, following an open call for expressions of interest. (2) The European Research Council (ERC) : the Commission shall establish a European Research Council (ERC) to implement the actions under Pillar I 'Open Science' which relate to the ERC. The ERC shall be composed of the independent Scientific Council and the dedicated implementation structure responsible for the administrative implementation and programme execution. The President shall be appointed by the Commission following a transparent recruitment process involving an independent dedicated search committee, for a term of office limited to four years, renewable once. (3) The European Innovation Council (EIC) : to implement the EIC, the Commission shall establish a high level board (the EIC Board) that shall advise, inter alia, on the overall strategy, objectives, activities, evaluation criteria and selection of experts. The EIC shall be the sole channel for the Union support to breakthrough market-creating innovation. It shall provide direct tailor-made support to innovators through two main funding instruments – the Pathfinder and the Accelerator – which shall both focus through a mainly bottom-up, high-risk approach on breakthrough innovation; on innovator needs and be pro-actively managed. (4) Work programmes : the programme shall be implemented by work programmes referred to in Article 110 of Financial Regulation. They shall be prepared following a strategic planning process. Work programmes shall set out, where applicable, the overall amount reserved for blending operations. (5) Committee procedure : for the implementation of Horizon Europe, the Commission shall be assisted by a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. It would meet in different configurations according to the matter to be discussed. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the framework programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices."
5898EP7,"""""Fund for European aid to the most deprived""""",0.035,0.886,0.947,0.29,0.424,0.795,0.908,0.8,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: the creation of a European Fund for the most deprived. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2010, nearly one quarter of Europeans (116 million) were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This is about 2 million more than in the previous year and the first figures available for 2011 confirm this trend. About 40 million of European citizens suffer from severe material deprivation. The main features of material deprivation are the inability to access appropriate quantities and quality of food and homelessness (4.1 million were homeless in Europe in 2009/2010, according to estimates). There are 25.4 million children at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the Union. Children suffering from these forms of material deprivation are less likely than their better-off peers to do well at school, enjoy good health and realise their full potential as adults. While the needs of those who are at the margins of the society keep growing, the ability of Member States to support them has in many cases diminished. In many Member States it is felt that policies decided at European level are in some ways responsible for these developments. The Union's response to poverty and material deprivation: the main Union's instrument for supporting employability, fighting poverty and promoting social inclusion is and will remain the European Social Fund (ESF). Next to that, the EU's Food Distribution programme for the Most Deprived People (MDP) has for more than two decades provided food aid for those persons. It was created in 1987 to make meaningful use of agricultural surpluses, which might otherwise have been destroyed, by making them available to Member States wishing to use them. Over the years, the scheme became an important source of provisions for organisations working in direct contact with the least fortunate members of society, providing them with food. The expected depletion and high unpredictability of intervention stocks over the period 2011-2020, as a consequence of successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, has deprived the MDP of the original rationale underpinning it and it will be discontinued at the end of 2013. The potential significant cut in the support provided under the MDP scheme in 2012 was heavily criticized by civil society organisations, with regional and local authorities' representatives stressing the importance of this support and pleading for its continuation at a time when needs are increasing. Discussions in the Council and the European Parliament and with civil society and local authorities on the current forms of aid for the most deprived under the MDP programme have provided meaningful insights and ideas for the future. On the other hand, Member States’ views about such an instrument are divided: seven Member States have expressed their opposition to continuation of the MDP beyond 2013. Other Member States have argued strongly in support of the scheme. The European Parliament has repeatedly expressed strong support for the continuation of the food aid programme in the interest of better social cohesion in Europe. It called for a strategy to be drawn up on the subject – firstly, in a written declaration (2010) and then in a resolution (2011). Given persistent material deprivation, EU assistance to the most deprived in society remains necessary. In its proposal for the next multiannual financial framework the Commission has reflected this and reserved a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a new instrument designed to fight extreme forms of poverty and exclusion. Against this background, the proposed Regulation establishes for the period 2014-2020 a new instrument that will complement the existing cohesion instruments and notably the European Social Fund, by addressing the worst and most socially corrosive forms of poverty, food deprivation as well as homelessness and material deprivation of children while supporting accompanying measures aiming at the social reintegration of the most deprived persons of the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the core issue examined by the impact assessment concerned the scope of the new instrument. The options considered were: Option 0 : no funding; Option 1 : a successor instrument to the current MDP limited to dispensing food aid; Option 2 : an instrument which would complement the distribution of food aid with support for accompanying measures aiming at the social inclusion of the food aid recipients, and Option 3 : a comprehensive instrument supporting material relief in terms of food, goods for homeless people and goods for materially deprived children, combined with accompanying measures aiming at the social reintegration of the most deprived persons. The net impact of Option 0 depends on how the funds made available are reallocated. But it would certainly be seen as attesting to an erosion of solidarity in Europe at a time when poverty is increasing. Compared to Option 1, Option 2 and even more so Option 3 entail a reduction of the food aid distributed as some resources are allocated to other types of actions. However, the accompanying measures should also ensure greater sustainability of the results achieved. Option 3 is preferred because it best allows tailoring the supported interventions to local needs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 175(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this Commission proposal related to the creation of a European Fund for the most deprived for the period 2014-2020. The proposed Regulation defines the objectives and scope, sets down the available financial resources and the various eligibility criteria, and lays down the rules to ensure the Fund’s effectiveness. General and specific objectives: the general objective of the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (the Fund) is to promote social cohesion in the Union by contributing to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy's objective of reducing by at least 20 million of the number of people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion. This translates into the specific objective of supporting national schemes which provide non-financial assistance to the most deprived persons through partner organisations. Scope: the Fund addresses food deprivation, homelessness and material deprivation of children. Each Member State may choose to address one or more of these forms of deprivation. It may also support accompanying measures, complementing material support, to contribute to the social reintegration of the most deprived persons. Eligible population and targeting: the population eligible to receive material assistance comprises the most deprived persons of the Union. Definition of the criteria for identifying the most deprived persons to be assisted will be the responsibility of the Member States or the partner organisations since they are best placed to target the assistance taking local needs into account. By defining the type of goods that will be distributed, namely food or basic consumer goods for personal use of homeless persons or of children, the Regulation also contains an indirect targeting mechanism. N.B. the Fund may only be used to support distribution of food or goods that are in conformity with the Union legislation on consumer product safety. Partner organisations: the partner organisations are the ones that deliver directly or indirectly the food or goods to the most deprived persons. In order to ensure that the Fund will contribute to sustainable reduction of poverty and to improvement of social cohesion, the partner organisations that deliver directly the food or goods will themselves have to undertake activities complementing the provision of material assistance, aiming at the social integration of the most deprived persons. The Fund itself may support such accompanying measures. The national authorities may either purchase the food or goods or make them available to partner organisations or provide the partner organisation with funding for the purchase of the food or goods. If the purchase of food or goods is undertaken by a partner organisation, it can either distribute the items itself or entrust the distribution to other partner organisations. Implementing provisions: the Fund will be implemented following the model of cohesion policy, i.e. through shared management on the basis of one 7-year operational programme per Member State covering the period 2014 to 2020. Implementation arrangements: the proposal follows the approach of the structural funds in terms of implementation arrangements, allowing notably the Member States to use, if they so wish, the structures, designated authorities and procedures set up for the European Social Fund, in order to minimize the administrative burden related to the transition from the current scheme for distribution of food to the most deprived persons to the new Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived. The provisions relating to programming, monitoring, evaluation and information and communication are, however, streamlined and simplified in order to be commensurate to the specificity of the objectives and target populations of the Fund. Eligibility rules: the eligibility rules are also designed to take into account the nature of the Fund and of the various actors that will be involved in its implementation. In particular, the Regulation provides for simplified cost methods for the majority of categories of expenditure and opens options for the others categories. Financial management of the Fund: the financial management and control system also derives from the structural funds logic. Also, some provisions have been adapted and simplified to be fully adequate to the types of operations that will be supported by the Fund, notably in terms of pre-financing, content of the payments applications to the Commission as well as proportional control. The partner organisations have a limited capacity to advance the funds necessary. Likewise, the Member States may have difficulties to mobilise the resources necessary to pre-finance the operations. In addition, the Member States facing the greatest fiscal constraints are likely to be those with the highest number of most deprived people. In order to address this situation, that could put at risk the achievement of the Fund's objective, the level of pre-financing is set at 11% of the total allocation to a Member State. This will allow covering up to 90% of the costs of the first year's aid campaign not counting technical assistance, transport, administrative costs and the accompanying measures. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the Fund for the period 2014-2020 shall be EUR 2.5 billion at 2011 prices, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in an annex to the proposal. For the purpose of programming and subsequent inclusion in the general budget of the Union, the amount of resources shall be indexed at 2% per year. Criteria will be laid down by the Commission, by means of implementing acts, setting out the annual breakdown of the global resources by Member State, taking into account the following indicators established by Eurostat: the population suffering from severe material deprivation; the population living in households with very low work intensity. 0.35% of the global resources shall be allocated to technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. Appropriations of around EUR 7.112 million between 2012 and 2020 are also provide for the management of the Fund (Heading 5 of the multiannual framework – human and administrative resources). DELEGATED ACTS: the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty shall be devolved to the Commission in respect of the responsibilities of Member States concerning: the procedure for reporting irregularities and recovery of sums unduly paid, the modalities of exchange of information of operations, the arrangements for the adequate audit trail, the conditions of national audits, the designation criteria for managing authorities and certifying authorities, the identification of commonly accepted data carriers, and the criteria for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied."
2546EP8,"""""Cableway installations""""",0.843,0.959,0.96,0.542,0.212,0.91,0.937,0.827,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to revise Directive 2000/9/EC in order to ensure that cableway installations fulfil the requirements providing for a high level protection of and safety of users while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market for subsystems and safety components. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/9/EC relating to cableway installations designed to carry persons became applicable on 3 May 2002. It sets out essential requirements with which cableway installations, their infrastructure, subsystems and safety components must comply in order to be safe. The main types of cableway installations covered by Directive 2000/9/EC are funiculars, gondolas, detachable chair lifts, fixed-grip chair lifts, aerial tramways, funitels, combined installations (made of several cableway types, such as those of gondolas and chairlifts) and drag lifts. Experience from the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC showed the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty mainly as regards the: (i) scope, in particular with regard to new types of cableway installations; (ii) lack of an appropriate range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems, which has led to divergent interpretations and implementation of the conformity assessment of subsystems. It is also necessary to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the “goods package” adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008 establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an “alignment package” adopted on 21 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred solution consists of combining two options: (i) amending Directive 2000/9/EC; (ii) providing more extensive guidance on the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC with regard to its scope and of recommending the application of specific conformity assessment procedures for the assessment of subsystems. CONTENT: the proposal intends to replace Directive 2000/9/EC on cableway installations designed to carry persons by a Regulation. It lays down rules on the design and construction of cableway installations designed to transport persons and on the making available on the market and the free movement of subsystems and safety components for such installations. The proposal intends to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the “goods package” adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008. Scope : the proposal clarifies and updates the existing scope: in light of the development of new types of cableway installations, it is clarified that the exclusion of cableway installations used for leisure purposes in fairgrounds or amusement parks does not apply to cableway installations that are intended for a dual function, namely of transporting persons and for leisure activities; the exclusion of certain cableway installations intended for agricultural or industrial purposes is maintained, but it clarifies that it also covers cableway installations intended for the service of mountain shelters or huts that are not intended for the transport of the public; the current exclusion of cable-operated ferries is also updated to all cable-operated installations where the users or carriers are water-borne, such as cable-operated water ski installations; the exclusions provided for in Directive 2000/9/EC relating to rack-and-pinion railways and chain-driven installations are not reintroduced. Obligations of economic operators : the proposal contains, with regard to subsystems and safety components, the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision. Harmonised standards : Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2000/9/EC which cover the same aspects have not been reintroduced in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. Conformity assessment : the proposal keeps the requirement for a notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all subsystems and safety components. It introduces a range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems based on the conformity assessment modules of the NLF Decision. In this framework, it also introduces the CE marking for subsystems. Notified bodies : in line with the NLF Decision, the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and introduces specific requirements for notifying authorities. Application : the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies and Member States time to adapt to the new requirements. However, the designation of notified bodies pursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation. A transitional provision is foreseen for the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2000/9/EC with regard to subsystems and safety components so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements."
1297EP7,"""""European Heritage Label""""",0.035,0.773,0.684,0.419,0.212,0.783,0.738,0.457,0,0,0,0,"The European Parliament adopted by 511 votes to 64, with 57 abstentions, a resolution on the Revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan. Members consider that energy efficiency and savings are the most cost-effective and fastest way to reduce CO2 and other emissions and increase security of supply. Academic evidence clearly supports the view that efforts need to be stepped up, including at the regional and the local level to reach the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, as at current rates of progress only around half of this target would be met by 2020, even though practices and technologies to achieve this target already exist. 1) Compliance with and implementation of existing legislation: Parliament calls on Member States, local authorities, and especially on the Commission, to give energy efficiency the attention it deserves, and put in place resources (staffing and finance) which match their ambitions. It points out that energy efficiency should be integrated into all relevant policy areas, including finance, regional and urban development, transport, agriculture, industrial policy and education. The Commission is invited to present in sufficient time before the 4th of February 2011 Energy Summit, within its revised Energy Efficiency Action Programme (EEAP), an evaluation of the implementation of the existing legislation. Members consider that the new Energy Action Plan 2011-2020 should be presented as soon as possible, and energy efficiency should have an important role in the future Roadmap towards a low-carbon energy system and economy by 2050. They invite the European Union to adopt a binding target on energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020, and thereby advance the transition into a sustainable and green economy. According to Members, the EEAP should be ambitious and focus on the full energy supply chain, which takes stock of the progress achieved with all measures contained in the 2006 Action Plan which are still under way, and includes additional measures which are cost-efficient and adequate principles. Parliament calls on the Commission to design the new EEAP taking into account the needs of vulnerable energy consumers and to promote measures to raise the level of awareness for and the know-how of energy efficiency issues among all relevant stakeholders and all professional actors involved at all stages. The resolution calls for a revision of the Energy Services Directive (ESD) in 2011 that includes an expanded time framework until 2020, a critical assessment of National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and their implementation, including common standards for reporting. Member States are urged to implement quickly and efficiently market surveillance and compliance-monitoring programmes for Directive establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products, Directive on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products, and Regulation on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters. 2) Energy infrastructure (production and transmission): Members consider that a stronger focus is needed on system innovations such as smart grids (for electricity but also for heating and cooling), smart metering, gas networks integrating biogas and energy storage. Parliament underlines that an explicit and comprehensive strategy for heat generation and use (industrial heat, domestic heating, cooling) is needed. It is noted that improvements to the energy efficiency of the housing stock will lead to a reduction in heat demand which should be factored in when assessing district heating capacity. Members stress the fact that second to energy efficiency at the source (i.e. in primary energy production), tackling losses of (electrical) energy during transport through the grids should be considered a priority. They call for a revision of Directive 2004/8/EC (known as the CHP Directive) to promotehighly efficient combined heat and power (CHP), Micro-CHP, use of waste heat from industry, and district heating/cooling systems. Member States are called upon, not only to support high efficiency industrial CHP generation, including by changing from fossil fuel to biomass, but also, for those which have of district heating infrastructure, to promote the use of CHP by supporting the establishment and refurbishment of district heating systems through appropriate financing and regulatory measures. The Commission is asked to support and promote the setting up and development of a European high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid able to optimise the harnessing of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and hydropower. 3) Urban development and buildings: noting that buildings are responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and about 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, Parliament calls on the Commission to assess the potential for efficiency in existing buildings starting with public administration buildings including schools and propose a cost-efficient target for the reduction of the primary energy consumption of buildings. For their part, Member States are called upon to implement practicable programmes to support deep renovations by which the energy demand will initially be reduced by more than 50% over pre-renovation performance. The resolution asks that Member States should be required to include set annual refurbishment targets in their national action plans on Energy Efficiency and calls on the Commission to propose policy options on how to achieve a nearly zero level building stock in the context of the 2050 energy roadmap. Parliament believes it is essential that the homes of energy poor households are improved to the highest possible energy efficiency standards and without raising the daily costs for the energy poor. It is also convinced that it is key for achieving the energy savings target that public authorities at national, regional and local level lead the way. It calls on public authorities to go well beyond the requirements set in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, in particular by renovating their existing stock as early as possible to a level comparable to nearly zero energy standard, where technically and economically feasible. It adds that the EU institutions and agencies should set an example, in particular in those buildings that have been identified as having an energy efficiency potential, by refurbishing these buildings in a cost-efficient manner to nearly zero level by 2019 as part of a wider audit of energy use by the institutions. Acknowledging the potential of energy savings in buildings, both in cities and rural areas, Parliament calls for innovative solutions to removing barriers to energy refurbishments, such as district refurbishment plans, financial incentives and technical assistance. It stresses that EU schemes should provide incentives for retrofitting buildings to go beyond the minimum legal requirements and address only buildings with an energy efficiency potential. The resolution calls on the Member States to accelerate the introduction of Energy Performance Certificates which are issued in an independent manner by qualified and/or accredited experts, as well as to create one-stop shops providing access to technical advice and support as well as financial incentives available at regional, national and European level. It also asks the Commission to propose energy benchmarks or requirements with regard to the installation of street lighting by public authorities including the use of smarter controls and energy saving use patterns by 2012. Parliament urges Member States to systematically use energy efficient public procurement practices. It takes the view that defining energy efficiency systematically as an award criterion in public procurement and making it a condition for publicly funded projects would give this policy a major push. 4) ICT and products: Parliament calls for the rapid and proper implementation of the Directives on Ecodesign and Energy Labelling and regrets current long delays. It suggests clearer and stricter deadlines for adoption, by proposing implementing or respectively delegated acts covering new energy-related products. Members believe that the Ecodesign Directive should cover more products including, if appropriate, new household appliances, ICT, energy-related products for use in buildings (such as industrial electrical motors, machinery, air conditioning, heat exchangers, heating and lighting equipment and pumps), industrial and agricultural equipment, building materials, and products for the efficient use of water. The resolution calls on the Commission to combine existing European legislation such as the Eco-Design-Directive and the Energy Labelling Directive, in order to implement EU legislation most efficiently and make use of synergies, especially for the consumer. Parliament also considers that legislation should address products, systems and their energy use. It regards it as necessary to increase the awareness of EU citizens including relevant sales professionals, regarding the energy and resource efficiency of consumer and energy-related products. The resolution insists that more emphasis should be given to an analysis of the consequences of energy efficiency standards. Members find, in this context, that uniform technical standards are the appropriate means of achieving higher market penetration for energy efficient products. Parliament emphasises that Europe should be at the cutting edge in the development of energy related Internet and ICT low-carbon technologies and applications. It acknowledges the need to support partnerships between the ICT sector and major emitting sectors to improve the energy efficiency and emissions of these sectors. For smart metering to be a success, members consider it is crucial to inform society of its benefits. Members call on the Commission to put forward a number of recommendations before the end of 2011 to ensure, among other things, that: smart metering is implemented in accordance with the timetable of the 3rd Energy Market Package so that the objective of having 80% of buildings fitted with smart meters by 2020 will be met; Member States agree by the end of 2011 on minimum common functionalities for smart meters; there should be smart meter benefits for consumers, such as energy reductions; Member States develop and publish a strategy to deliver the potential benefit of smart metering to all consumers, including vulnerable and low income people. 5) Transport: the Commission is called to publish an ambitious white paper on transport in order to develop a sustainable European transport policy that promotes the introduction of energy-efficient new technologies and reduces dependency on fossil fuels. Parliament considers that all tools, including vehicle and fuel taxation, labelling, minimum efficiency standards and measures to improve and favour public transportation, are urgently needed in order to address transport emissions. It reiterates the need to promote inter-modal transport solutions, as well as the development of intelligent transport systems in order to achieve energy savings in the transport sector. The Commission is called upon to: present by the end of 2011 a strategy for lowering the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of heavy duty vehicles; consider adopting a single mandatory pan-European system of labelling for passenger vehicles and to examine the possibility of extending this proposed single labelling system to include electric and hybrid vehicles; ensure comparable framework conditions for the development of electric vehicles and for the development of vehicles using fuel cells or other more sustainable energy sources. The resolution asks Member States to abolish tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-inefficient cars and replace them with tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-efficient cars. 6) Incentives and financing: Parliament considers that the Commission should put forward proposals on how to establish an EU framework of revolving financial instruments to support or guarantee complementary energy efficiency measures, existing national schemes and distribution channels (e.g. by means of risk sharing) and to encourage the setting-up and improvement of energy efficiency schemes in Member States. The Commission is called upon to propose, within the EEAP, policy options on how to ensure that energy efficiency funds are in place at national, regional or local level. Members consider that these funds could, through financial intermediaries, play an important role in the development of such instruments, which would deliver financing possibilities to private property owners, SMEs and energy service companies (ESCOs).  Members welcome the support given in the Europe 2020 Strategy to shifting the tax burden to energy and environmental taxes which can create incentives to consumers and the industry for energy efficiency and job creation. They invite the Member States to consider the possibility to reduce VAT rates for energy efficiency refurbishment works. Members call on the Commission to submit an annual report on whether and how appropriate (fiscal and subsidy-linked) incentives at national level might be created, such as, in the private sphere and in SMEs, depreciations of small-scale industrial equipment up to EUR 10 000 or, in the industrial sphere, progressive depreciations of 50% in the first year or the creation of appropriate investment incentives and of research subsidies, in order to push forward energy efficiency measures. The resolution also stresses the need to improve the use of existing EU funds such as the ERDF and EAFRD for energy efficiency measures. It calls for energy saving to be integrated into the conditionality for granting EU assistance and for consideration to be given to the possibility of directing a higher proportion of the national allocations toward energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. It calls on the Commission to use the mid term review in order to allocate more funds for energy efficiency programmes and to promote the possibility to use up to 15% of the ERDF for energy efficiency. Lastly, the Commission is called upon to make energy efficiency one of the key priorities of the 8th Framework Research Programme and to allocate a significant part to energy efficiency sub-programmes similar to the current Intelligent Energy Programme."

The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, exercising its prerogatives as an association committee in accordance with Rule 50 of the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, was also consulted for an opinion on the report. The committee recommended that Parliament’s position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows: A sustainable industry policy strategy in the Union : the committee stressed the need to exclude unfair tenders comprising goods and/or services originating outside the Union. At the same time, reciprocity and fair conditions for the market access of Union industries should be ensured. Keep the principle of uniformity of the Common Commercial Policy (CCP): to prevent distortion of the internal market, and ensure efficient leverage through the CCP, Members stated that that Member States or their contracting authorities may restrict the access of third country goods and services to their tendering procedures only by measures provided for in the Regulation or by relevant Union law, and only after an investigation by the Commission has revealed the absence of substantial reciprocity by the third country concerned. Scope: the Regulation shall apply to the award of contracts and to the award of concessions for services provided for governmental purposes. It is proposed to exclude from the scope of the Regulation developing countries considered to be vulnerable due to a lack of diversification and insufficient integration within the international trading system as well as countries and potential GSP+ beneficiary countries. Rules of origin : the determination of the origin of a service should be made in line with the principles of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The provisions determining the rules of origin of services should prevent the circumvention of restrictions on access to the Union public procurement market through the establishment of ""letterbox"" companies. Procedure : Members wanted to ensure that the term 'calendar days' is consistently used throughout the proposal instead of 'days', 'calendar days' and 'working days'. They also shortened the length of the procedures throughout the proposal to provide faster protection, and made amendments intended to avoid an endless consultation procedure with third countries. Public contracts : in the performance of public contracts economic operators must comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions. A ‘lack of substantial reciprocity’ shall be presumed, where the non-observance of international labour law provisions listed in the Directive on public procurement. Assess impact and review the instrument : the report proposes incorporating a review clause, which obliges the Commission to look into the impact of the regulation, after it has come into force and being applied for a few years. Accordingly, when the Commission submits its second report, it shall also submit a legislative proposal for an amended Regulation or set out the reasons why, in its view, no changes are necessary. For the same reason, the report suggests limiting the application of any restrictive measures taken through an implementing act to up to 5 years so as to avoid these measures turning into a permanent closure of the market."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2001 International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly endorsed the application of open emissions trading systems to international aviation. The Union is endeavouring to secure a future international agreement to control greenhouse gas impacts from aviation and, in the meantime, is limiting climate change impacts from aviation activities to and from aerodromes in the Union by autonomous action. In line with the outcome of the 38th ICAO Assembly held in September 2013, there should be a single global market-based measure (MBM) applying to international aviation emissions from 2020 onwards. In response to this progress and to promote further momentum towards the successful establishment of a global MBM, the Commission proposes to make amendments to the aviation activities covered by the EU ETS. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment has shown that adapting the EU ETS to accord with what was expected to be ICAO's MBM Resolution for the period up to 2020 is feasible at low administrative costs. The environmental benefit of this proposal comes from two key elements: it gives impetus to the global MBM that will cover the total emissions from international aviation from 2020 onwards. Depending on the ambition level agreed for the global MBM, total international aviation emissions will be capped at their 2020 level and even be halved by 2050 below 2005 levels; the EU ETS will continue to achieve substantial emission reductions that are expected to be up to 250 million tons CO2 in the period from 2013 to 2020. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposed amending the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) so that aviation emissions would be covered for the part of flights that takes place in European regional airspace. The adjustment in the legislation would apply from 1 January 2014 and until a planned global market-based mechanism (MBM) becomes applicable to international aviation emissions by 2020. The key features of the revised ETS system resulting from this proposal would be as follows: flights between aerodromes in the EEA remain fully covered, as under the original Directive and Decision No. 377/2013/EU; flights to and from third countries which are not developed countries and which emit less than 1% of global aviation emissions would be exempted; fights to and from third countries are responsible for emissions taking place not beyond EEA countries, as from 2014. A simplified procedure is proposed to determine the relevant proportion of emissions of a given flight which is covered by the ETS; overflights of EEA countries are exempt, as are emissions from flights between airports in third countries and EEA airports as regards European dependencies and territories, and flights to and from EEA airports and those territories. As a simplification and to in order to lighten administrative tasks for the smallest aircraft operators, the proposal provides that action should not be taken against non-commercial aircraft operators in respect of emissions from small aircraft operators emitting less than 1000 tonnes CO2 per annum. This is expected to reduce the number of aircraft operators regulated by Member States by around 2200 representing 0.2% of emissions. All other obligations in respect of flights remain unaffected. The Commission calls for this proposal to be adopted rapidly by the European Parliament and Council, so as to provide clarity for aircraft operators, who would otherwise have to surrender allowances. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no budgetary implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Iceland is a candidate country for EU membership since the European Council of 17 June 2010 noted that Iceland meets the political criteria set by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 and decided to open negotiations with Iceland. Similarly, the European Council of 16-17 December 2010 agreed to give Montenegro the status of candidate country. In addition, the Council has invited the Commission to propose an amendment to Article 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 with a view to clarifying the rules regarding the participation in the award of grant contracts financed under the IPA Cross-Border Cooperation component and ensuring coherence with other external aid instruments and in particular with the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Lastly, Council Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 establishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community designates the committee provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 (the ""Phare committee"") to assist the Commission in the management of the assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community. In accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006, Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 has been repealed. However it continues to apply for legal acts and commitments implementing the budget years preceding 2007. As Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 continues to be the basic act for financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community beyond these budget years, the Phare committee should also be continued for that purpose. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the Commission proposes three amendments to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). Iceland and Montenegro will be transferred from the list of potential candidate countries (Annex II) to the list of candidate countries (Annex I), following the decisions of the European Council. The Commission proposes to the Council and the Parliament an amendment to Article 19 ""Rules of participation and origin, eligibility for grants"" of the IPA Regulation in order to align its provisions with those of Article 21 ""Participation in tenders and contracts"" of the ENPI Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006. This amendment addresses the concern, expressed by EU Member States involved in IPA cross–border cooperation (CBC) programmes, with regard to the participation in calls for proposals. Member States asked for participation in calls for proposals to be limited to applicants from countries participating in the relevant IPA CBC programme, as is already the case for the ENPI CBC programmes. The Council invited the Commission to propose a possible solution at the earliest opportunity. The Commission proposes that Article 19 should be aligned with Article 21 of the ENPI Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006 by inserting a new paragraph which, considering the local nature of the CBC programmes, would allow participation in calls for proposals to be limited to local actors. The Commission proposes to amend the IPA Regulation with the aim of allowing the Phare committee to continue to assist the Commission in the management of the financial assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 on assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the healthcare sector is one of the largest in the EU: it accounts for approximately 10% of the EU’s gross domestic product and employs one in ten workers, with a higher than average proportion of workers with tertiary-level education. Health therefore plays an important role in the Europe 2020 agenda . As underlined in its Communication of 29 June 2011 entitled “ A budget for Europe 2020 ”, this third programme of EU action in the field of health (2014-2020), ‘Health for Growth’, strengthens and emphasises the links between economic growth and a healthy population to a greater extent than the previous programmes. The Programme is geared towards actions with clear EU added value. The general objectives of the Health for Growth Programme shall be to work with Member States to: encourage innovation in healthcare, increase the sustainability of health systems, and improve the health of the EU citizens and protect them from cross-border health threats. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment looked at different options for the programme and their expected impact: Option 1 : minimal action: this option corresponds to the absolute minimum of actions resulting from the legal obligations imposed by the Treaty and the existing EU acquis in the field of medicinal products, medical devices, substances of human origin, patients rights in cross border healthcare, Health security (cross border health threats) and tobacco. Option 2 : baseline scenario: this option implies continuing the programme in its present form with no changes consequently to the findings of the evaluations, in addition to the direct legal obligations. ·  Option 3, sub-option A : this option corresponds to a well structured programme, with SMART objectives, prioritised actions, creating EU added value and with better monitoring of outcomes and impacts. It will be focused on: i) supporting actions required by the current EU health and internal market legislation, ii) supporting the up-take of innovative solutions for improving specific points concerning the quality, efficiency and sustainability of health systems, iii) prevention of diseases at EU level by helping and complementing Member States’ efforts to increase their citizens’ number of healthy life years (HLY), including the aspect of reduction of health inequalities but mainly by other means than the resources of the Programme and limited to development of working methods and policy evaluation; iv) supporting and complementing Member States efforts in protecting citizens from cross-border health threats. ·  Sub-option 3, sub-option B: this option corresponds to a well structured programme but dealing only with one of the general objectives as a trade off. This programme would be focused on: i) supporting actions required by the current EU health and internal market legislation, ii) supporting the up-take of innovative solutions for improving specific points concerning the quality, efficiency and sustainability of health, iii) supporting and complementing Member States efforts in protecting citizens from cross-border health threats. ·  Sub-option 3, sub-option C: this option corresponds to a programme limited to supporting actions required by the current EU health related legislation and to supporting solutions for cross border health threats. In addition, there would be some dissemination of the results of the current Health Programme (2008–2013) in order to take into account the conclusions of previous evaluations. Option 4: this corresponds to a well-structured programme focusing on the same issues as option 3 A but adding a specific objective for addressing wider, social and economic, causes of health inequalities by appropriate financial means. This option would imply a significant increase of the envelope for the Programme. Following analysis of the results, Option 3A is the preferred option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 168 (5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the general objectives of the Health for Growth Programme shall be to work with Member States to encourage innovation in healthcare and increase the sustainability of health systems, to improve the health of the EU citizens and protect them from cross-border health threats. It focuses on four specific objectives with a strong potential for economic growth through better health: 1) to develop common tools and mechanisms at EU level to address shortages of resources, both human and financial and to facilitate up-take of innovation in healthcare in order to contribute to innovative and sustainable health systems; 2) to increase access to medical expertise and information for specific conditions also beyond national borders and to develop shared solutions and guidelines to improve healthcare quality and patient safety in order to increase access to better and safer healthcare for EU citizens; 3) to identify, disseminate and promote the up-take of validated best practices for cost-effective prevention measures by addressing the key risk factors, namely smoking, abuse of alcohol and obesity, as well as HIV/AIDS, with a focus on the cross border dimension, in order to prevent diseases and promote good health; and 4) to develop common approaches and demonstrate their value for better preparedness and coordination in health emergencies in order to protect citizens from crossborder health threats. Eligible actions: the proposal lays down the actions eligible under the programme. Actions that will be eligible will be those that: Contribute to innovative and sustainable health systems : e.g. developing EU cooperation on Health Technology Assessment; promoting the uptake of health innovation and e-Health by increasing the interoperability of e-Health applications; supporting the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, a pilot project under Europe 2020 flagship initiative Innovation Union; fostering a health knowledge system,… Increase access to better and safer healthcare for citizens : e.g. supporting action on rare diseases including creation of European Reference Networks; strengthening collaboration on patient safety and quality of healthcare, by increasing the availability of information to patients, exchanging of best practices and development of guidelines; developing guidelines to improve the prudent use of antimicrobials in human medicine and reducing the practices that increase antimicrobial resistance,… Promote good health and preventing diseases : e.g. exchanging best practices on key health issues such as smoking prevention, abuse of alcohol and obesity; supporting the prevention of chronic diseases including cancer, by sharing knowledge and best practice and developing joint activities,… Protect citizens from cross border health threats : e.g. strengthening preparedness and response for serious cross border health threats; supporting capacity building against health threats in Member States,… A more detailed description of the content those actions may have is included in Annex I of the proposed Regulation. Participation of third countries: the Programme shall be open on a cost basis, to the participation of third countries, in particular of: · acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates benefiting from a pre-accession strategy, ·  EFTA/EEA countries, ·  neighbouring countries and the countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) applies, ·  other countries in accordance with the conditions laid down by a relevant bilateral or multilateral agreement. Types of intervention and participation: financial contributions by the Union may take the form of either grants or public procurement or any other interventions necessary for achieving the objectives of the Programme. The proposal describes the forms of intervention by type of action eligible. Overall; the design of the revised programme favours simplification of interventions: ·  simplified rules, ·  reducing the costs of participation, ·  accelerating award procedures, and · providing a ""one-stop shop"" to make it easier for beneficiaries to access EU funding. Budget and rate of co-financing : the programme will have a budget of EUR 446 million from 2014-2020. The level of Union co-financing for grants for actions, actions co-financed by the competent authorities of the Member States or third countries, or by non-governmental bodies mandated by these authorities and operating grants will be harmonised at 60% of eligible costs and up to 80% in cases of exceptional utility. Provisions are foreseen to define the rules regarding eligibility for grants for actions covered by the Programme. Grants may be awarded to legally established organisations, public authorities, public sector bodies, in particular research and health institutions, universities and higher education establishments and undertakings, in accordance with strictly defined criteria. Administrative and technical assistance : the financial allocation for the Programme may also cover expenses pertaining to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities required directly for the management of the Programme and the achievement of its objectives, in particular studies, meetings, information and communication actions, including corporate communication of the political priorities of the EU, as well as all other technical and administrative assistance expense incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme. Methods of implementation: the Commission shall be responsible for the implementation of the Programme by drawing up annual work programmes establishing the priorities and actions to be undertaken, as well as other detailed eligibility criteria for the beneficiaries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Consistency and complementarity with other policies: the Commission shall, in cooperation with the Member States, ensure overall consistency and complementarity between the Programme and other policies, instruments and actions of the Union. Monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of results: the usual methods of monitoring, evaluation, dissemination of results and combating fraud are foreseen in the proposal. The Commission shall, in close cooperation with the Member States, monitor the implementation of the actions under the programme in the light of its objectives and indicators and keep the European Parliament informed thereof. Reporting : no later then mid-2018, an evaluation report shall be established by the Commission on the achievement of the objectives of all the measures (at the level of results and impacts), the efficiency of the use of resources and its European added value, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the measures. The longer-term impacts and the sustainability of effects of the Health for Growth Programme should be evaluated with a view to feeding into a decision on a possible renewal, modification or suspension of a subsequent programme. It should be noted that the Member States shall designate National Focal Points which shall assist the Commission in the promotion of the Programme, the dissemination of its results and the information on its impacts in their respective countries. Repeal: Decision No 1350/2007/EC shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2014. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the financial appropriations for implementing the programme over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 will amount to EUR 446 million (in current prices)."
228EP8,"""""Autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova""""",0.671,0.864,0.98,0.083,0.058,0.94,0.88,0.5,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 with a view to further liberalising imports of certain products of the fruit and vegetables sector from Moldova into the EU. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for Moldova. That scheme gives all products originating in the Republic of Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products listed in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties. In the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan, and the Eastern Partnership, Moldova has adopted an ambitious agenda for political association and further economic integration with the Union. The Association Agreement, including the establishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the Union and Moldova was signed on 27 June 2014 and will apply provisionally from 1 September 2014. The specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015. Recently Moldova has experienced and continues to experience difficulties with its fruit and vegetables exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the government of Moldova. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the horticultural sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 250 000 people (i.e. around 10% of the active population). Moreover, horticultural export levels have fallen in recent years. Taking into consideration the current temporary severe difficulties in accessing Moldova's traditional export markets for a number of products, the European Commission proposes to increase temporarily its fully liberalised market access for imports of these products from Moldova, allowing their commercialisation in the Union. CONTENT: in order to support the efforts of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the Association Agreement, the proposed amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces three new duty free tariff quotas for fresh apples, fresh table grapes and fresh plums. As the Autonomous Trade Preference scheme expires at the end of 2015, this amendment provides for a time-limited response to the immediate needs for the key export products adversely affected (i.e. apples, plums and table grapes). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment to the Regulation incurs negligible implications for the EU budget. The total imports from Moldova to the EU in 2013 constituted 0.1% of the total imports to the EU. Whereas about 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU duty-free, imports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes under entry price from the Republic of Moldova represented less than 0.01% of the total EU imports from the world of these products. The corresponding loss of tariff revenue should therefore have a limited impact on the EU’s own resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the collection of data by type of goods is mandatory for road (Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/98), rail (Regulation (EC) No 91/2003), and inland waterways (Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006) transport European statistics. European statistics on all modes of transport should be collected according to common concepts and standards, with the aim of achieving the fullest practicable comparability between transport modes. More particularly, the provision of comprehensive and homogeneous statistics by type of goods for all the modes of transport will provide a general framework for monitoring policies for promoting co-modality, i.e. the possibility of combining various modes of transport within the same transport chain in the best way, and the modernisation of freight transport logistics. More generally, the proposed amendment, in combination with other initiatives, will adapt the statistical output to current and foreseeable users' needs. Under current legislation, (Directive 2009/42/EC, Annex VIII, data set B1), data are collected on a voluntary basis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: two options were considered: Option 1 : the current legislation is maintained Option 2 : the current legislation is amended. The second option was selected, in order secure a complete and continuous provision of statistical data on maritime transport by type of goods. LEGAL BASIS: Article 338 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of this proposal, namely the establishment of a common framework for the systematic production of European statistics on seaborne goods using the same classification by type of goods as for the other relevant transport statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States via a voluntary collection. They can be achieved more readily at European level since only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at European level, whereas the collection of data and compilation of comparable statistics on maritime transport can be organised by Member States. CONTENT: the objective of the Regulation is to ensure a complete and continuous provision of statistical data on maritime transport by type of goods, consistent and harmonised with the statistics already available for the other relevant modes of transport. According to the second paragraph of Annex VIII of Directive 2009/42/EC, the conditions for collecting data set B1 (data concerning ""Seaborne transport in the main European ports, by port, type of cargo, goods and relation"") shall be decided by the Council in the light of the results of the pilot study carried out during a three-year transitional period, as provided for in Directive 95/64/EC. Subsequently, the Commission reported that the collection of detailed information appeared feasible and at reasonable cost for bulk and semi-bulk cargo. Remaining difficulties have been solved since more experience has been gained with collecting the current variables and by the introduction of the NST 2007 (Standard Goods Classification for Transport Statistics, 2007) as the unique classification for transported goods in maritime, road, rail and inland waterways transport, applicable from the reference year 2008, covering the 2008 data. The proposal states that the first reference year for the obligation to provide data set B1 will be 2011, covering the 2011 data.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (repealing Council Directive 87/357/EEC and Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the free movement of safe consumer products is one of the cornerstones of the European Union. Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety (GPSD) lays down the requirement that consumer products must be safe and that Member States' market surveillance authorities must take action against dangerous products as well as exchange information to that effect through the Community rapid information exchange system RAPEX. Overlaps of market surveillance rules and obligations of economic operators laid down in various pieces of Union legislation (the GPSD, the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation that also covers consumer products) has led to confusion on the part of both economic operators and national authorities and has seriously hampered the effectiveness of market surveillance activity in the Union. The Commission considers that Directive 2001/95/EC needs to be fundamentally revised to improve its functioning and to ensure consistency with developments in Union legislation as regards market surveillance, obligations of economic operators and standardisation. In the interest of clarity, Directive 2001/95/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation. The proposal is part of the ""Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package"" which also includes a proposal for a single market surveillance regulation and a multiannual action plan for market surveillance covering the period 2013-2015. The Single Market Act II, adopted in 2012, confirms the ""Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package"" as a key action to improve the safety of products circulating in the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment prepared by the Commission thus covers aspects related to both this proposal and the proposal for a new Market Surveillance Regulation. The Commission's Impact Assessment Board delivered a favourable opinion in September 2012. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation on consumer product safety, which will replace Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety (GPSD), concerns manufactured non-food consumer products. It aims at clarifying the regulatory framework for consumer products taking into account legislative developments in recent years. Like the GPSD, the proposed Regulation requires that consumer products must be ""safe"", sets certain obligations on economic operators and contains provisions for the development of standards in support of the general safety requirement. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : the proposed Regulation clearly delimits its scope of application compared to sectoral Union harmonisation legislation. Whilst the general principle that all non-food consumer products must be safe applies across the board, the more detailed obligations on economic operators only apply to those operators that are not subject to corresponding obligations laid down in harmonising legislation covering a specific product sector. The definitions section has been updated and, where applicable aligned with the New Legislative Framework for the Marketing of Products. General safety requirement and obligations of economic operators : the general requirement, laid down already in the GPSD, that all consumer products must be safe when placed or made available on the Union market has been kept. However, its operation in practice will be significantly simplified due to the introduction of a clear link with sector-specific legislation and a simplification of the rules on standards. On the basis of Decision No 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products, the proposal: lays down the elementary obligations of economic operators (manufacturers, importers, distributors) involved in the supply chain of consumer products insofar as they are not subject to corresponding requirements under sector specific Union harmonisation legislation. These obligations concern issues related to labelling, product identification, corrective actions to be taken in case of unsafe products and information of the competent authorities; requires economic operators to be able to identify the operators who supplied them with the product and to whom they supplied it. Where justified due to the risks inherent to specific types of products, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures requiring economic operators to establish or adhere to an electronic traceability system. Use of European standards : like the GPSD, also the proposal for the new Regulation favours the use of standards in support of the implementation of the general safety requirement. However, the process to identify existing European standards or to ask for the development of European standards that would give rise to presume that a product is safe has been significantly simplified and aligned to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that sets a new overarching framework for European standardisation. Market surveillance and RAPEX : the provisions regarding market surveillance and RAPEX that are currently contained in the GPSD have been transferred to the proposal for a new single Market Surveillance Regulation. That new Regulation would produce a one-tier system in which all market surveillance rules are brought together in a single instrument and in which RAPEX will be the single alert system regarding products presenting a risk. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal does not have other budgetary implications than those related to the proper management of the Regulation which, in form of the GPSD, is already part of the Union law acquis. The budgetary implications are already foreseen in the existing or proposed programmes and respect the Commission proposal for the new multiannual financial framework. According to the financial statement, the total appropriations (operational appropriations, human resources and administrative expenditure) amount to EUR 12 019 million in commitments for 2015-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

BACKGROUND: the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Russian Federation, of the other part, (“the PCA”), entered into force on 1 December 1997. On 26 October 2007, the EC and the Russian Federation concluded an Agreement on trade in certain steel products. On 22 October 2007, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1342/2007 on administering certain restrictions on imports of certain steel products from the Russian Federation in order to implement the Agreement. The Agreement stipulates that in the event that the Russian Federation accedes to the World Trade Organisation before the expiration of the Agreement, the Agreement will be terminated and as a consequence the quantitative limits will be abolished as of the date of accession. On the date when the Russian Federation becomes a member of the World Trade Organisation the Regulation to implement the Agreement will no longer be necessary.

5703EP7,"""""Simple pressure vessels""""",0.877,0.872,0.912,0.645,0.455,0.892,0.877,0.8,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE : to align Directive 2009/105/EC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to making available on the market of simple pressure vessels with the new legislative framework, in particular to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (Goods Package). PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience with the implementation of Union harmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale – certain weaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of this legislation, leading to: the presence of non-compliant or dangerous products on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking; competitive disadvantages for economic operators complying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules; unequal treatment in the case of non-compliant products and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due to different enforcement practices; differing practices in the designation of conformity assessment bodies by national authorities; problems with the quality of certain notified bodies. To remedy these horizontal shortcomings in Union harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the “New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goods package. Its objective is to strengthen and complete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of their application and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists of two complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. This proposal on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to making available on the market of simple pressure vessels is presented in the framework of the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is part of a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the information collected, the Commission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared three options: Option 1 – No changes to the current situation; Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decision by non-legislative measures; Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision by legislative measures: this option consists in integrating the provisions of the NLF Decision into the existing directives. Option 3 was found to be the preferred option for the following reasons: (i) it will improve the competitiveness of companies and notified bodies taking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system; (ii) it will improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importers and distributors, as well as notified bodies; (iii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iv) it is considered more effective than option 2: due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that the positive impacts would materialise under that option. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the alignment to the NLF Decision requires a number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2009/105/EC. To ensure the readability of the amended text, the technique of recasting has been chosen. The proposal does not change the scope of Directive 2009/105/EC and the essential safety requirements. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Horizontal definitions : the proposal introduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughout Union harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistent meaning throughout that legislation. Obligations of economic operators and traceability requirements : the proposal clarifies the obligations of manufacturers and introduces obligations for importers and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer has carried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up a technical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer that this technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request. Furthermore importers must verify that the pyrotechnic articles are correctly marked and accompanied by instructions and safety information. They must keep a copy of the Declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address on the product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanying documentation. Distributors must verify that the article bears the CE marking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, and that it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions. Harmonised standards : compliance with harmonised standards provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation that sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulation contains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objections to harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisation process. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2009/105/EC which cover the same aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. The provision conferring presumption of conformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent of the presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essential requirements. Conformity assessment and CE marking : Directive 2009/105/EC on the placing on the market of simple pressure vessels has selected the appropriate conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers have to apply in order to demonstrate that their pyrotechnic articles comply with the essential safety requirements. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions set out in the NLF Decision. Notified Bodies : the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies. It clarifies that subsidiaries or subcontractors must also comply with the notification requirements. Specific requirements for notifying authorities are introduced, and the procedure for notification of notified bodies is revised. The competence of a notified body must be demonstrated by an accreditation certificate. Market surveillance and the safeguard clause procedure : the proposal revises the existing safeguard clause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between Member States, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, when a non-compliant article is found. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not have any implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products entered into force on 28 January 2022. Holders of marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products authorised under Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use, are not in a position to comply with the requirements set out in Articles 10 to 16 of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 with effect from 28 January 2022. Therefore, it is necessary to take urgent measures to address the concerns raised by Member States' competent authorities and stakeholders about the practical application of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 in order to remove any legal uncertainty and to avoid possible disruptions in the supply of veterinary medicines. CONTENT: the proposal provides for transitional rules in the proposal allow marketing authorisation holders to continue to place veterinary medicinal products complying with the packaging and labelling requirements of Directive 2001/82/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 on the market until 29 January 2027, even if they do not comply with the relevant requirements of Regulation 2019/6."
10154EP8,"""""Sovereign bond-backed securities""""",0.029,0.819,0.98,0.021,0.058,0.851,0.806,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to create a framework for sovereign bond-backed securities (SBBSs), to support further integration and diversification within Europe's financial sector. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: BACKGROUND: sovereign bond-backed securities (‘SBBSs’) can address some vulnerabilities that have been exposed by or have resulted from the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Reducing risks to financial stability by facilitating the diversification of banks' sovereign portfolios and further weakening the bank-sovereign nexus is of high importance for the completion of the Banking Union. This legislative proposal is part of the Commission's efforts to enhance Banking Union and Capital Markets Union. It aims to enable the emergence of an efficient market for SBBSs over time. In turn, SBBSs could support further portfolio diversification in the financial sector, while creating a new source of high-quality collateral particularly suited for use in cross-border financial transactions. In mid-2016, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) established a high-level task force (henceforth, the ESRB task force) to assess SBBSs' merits and feasibility. The ESRB task force concluded that a market for SBBSs can develop under certain conditions. Yet, whether or not SBBSs are viable can ultimately only be ascertained by putting them to a market test. This proposal paves the way for such a market test. A key finding of the ESRB task force, corroborated also by interactions with market participants and other stakeholders, is that the current regulatory framework constitutes a significant hindrance to the development of SBBSs. Under the existing regulatory framework, SBBSs would be defined as securitisation products, and hence would be treated significantly less favourably than their underlying portfolio of euro area sovereign bonds. However, due to the nature of their underlying assets and their standardised and simple nature, SBBSs carry risks that are comparable to the underlying sovereign bonds rather than regular securitisations. The Commission will also adopt the necessary changes to the prospectus schedules and building blocks to ensure that appropriate disclosure for this new type of financial instrument, tailored to the characteristics of the product, are set out. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: because the proposed framework only enables the private-sector led development of an SBBSs market, but does not guarantee it, the impact assessment considered two distinct scenarios to evaluate impacts, one in which SBBSs reach only a limited volume (EUR 100 billion) and a steady-state one in which they reach EUR 1.5 trillion. As regards the impact of SBBSs on the diversification of banks' sovereign portfolios, the assessment showed that the impact would be small in the limited volume scenario, but significant under the steady state scenario. CONTENT: this proposal aims to provide an enabling framework for a market-led development of Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities. SBBS operation : SBBSs would be created by the private sector specifically set up for the sole purpose of issuing to investors a series of securities representing claims on the proceeds from this underlying portfolio. The various securities issued would bear any losses from the underlying portfolio in a certain sequence (i.e., losses would accrue first to holders of sub-senior, or subordinated, securities and only after such securities have been completely wiped out would they also accrue to the holders of senior claims). SBBSs would not rely on any risk sharing or fiscal mutualisation between Member States. Only private investors would share risks and possible losses. SBBSs are therefore very different from Eurobonds. Composition and structure of a SBBS issue : the proposal provides a set of rules that define the constitutive elements of SBBSs. These rules are necessary to ensure that as standardised a product as possible is produced by the markets. This in turn favours its liquidity and appeal to investors. Under the proposal, the underlying portfolio of SBBSs should be composed of sovereign bonds of all EU Member States whose currency is the euro. A SBBSs issue should be composed of a senior tranche, corresponding to 70 percent of the nominal value of SBBSs issue, and one or more subordinated tranches. The purpose of the subordinated tranches is to provide protection to the senior tranche, which therefore is a low risk instrument. Notification and transparency : the proposal provides rules that define notification and transparency requirements for the issuing entity to ensure that self-attestation is performed in a harmonised and credible way. To ensure that investors are protected from the risk of insolvency of the institution that acquires the sovereign bonds (original purchaser, typically a bank), the issuance of SBBSs should be undertaken by a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) that is exclusively devoted to the issuance and management of SBBSs. The SPEs are responsible for compliance with the product and notification requirements. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is entrusted with the publication of notifications on its website. This will ensure that the SPEs take responsibility for claiming that a product qualifies as an SBBS and that there is transparency in the market. SPEs shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from incorrect or misleading notifications under the conditions stipulated by national law. Monitoring : the proposal contains rules regarding the supervision of SBBSs and possible sanctions in case of non-compliance and/or fraudulent behaviour of the issuing entity. It requires Member States to designate competent authorities in accordance with existing EU financial services legislation. The sanctions inflicted to a special purpose entity should be published. In addition, an SBBS which is found not fulfilling the requirements of the proposed Regulation should be removed without undue delay from the list of SBBS established by ESMA. Lastly, the proposal contains a set of amendments to the existing legal framework required to grant SBBSs regulatory treatment in line with their unique design and properties."

(1) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down inter alia the animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Union of dogs, cats and ferrets. Those requirements refer to the relevant animal health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC. The repeal of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by a new Regulation on the non-commercial movement of pet animals makes it necessary to amend Directive 92/65/EEC in order to delete and replace the references to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by references to the new Regulation. (2) In addition, Directive 92/65/EEC should also be amended to take account of the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97, which applies to the transport of dogs, cats and ferrets carried out within the Union. Moreover, experience in the application of Directive 92/65/EEC has shown that operators find it difficult to comply with the requirement laid down in that Directive that a clinical examination is carried out on animals 24 hours before their dispatch. The recommendations of the World Organisation for Animal Health for imports of dogs and cats provide for a clinical examination to be carried out 48 hours before shipment of the animals. It is therefore appropriate to extend the time limit laid down in Directive 92/65/EEC to 48 hours and to amend that Directive accordingly. This proposal and the proposal replacing and repealing Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 are presented together in order to be adopted simultaneously.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: the various Community financial instruments for external cooperation contain inconsistencies regarding the eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) are the only ones not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility of such costs for funding. The other instruments lay down that Community support may not be used to finance these costs in principle. They therefore allow for flexibility on a case-by-case basis and the authorising officer responsible may, where appropriate, decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects. Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical (owing, for example, to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country). In these situations, the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult. Note also that with the current wording the prohibition on financing for the payment of taxes concerns only those paid ""in beneficiary countries"", which adds difficulty of interpretation to the problem of eligibility (especially in the case of regional projects). Another example is the levying of local taxes (equivalent to VAT) which cannot be recovered because of a lack of machinery for relief and then have to be borne by the contractor because of the strict prohibition on covering taxes. In view of the above and of the evolving nature of tax rules in the beneficiary countries, it is essential to preserve sufficient flexibility to enable authorising officers to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is need to accept the eligibility of taxes for Community financing under the EIDHR and DCI, as they may do for other instruments of EC external assistance, where such taxes are lawful. Therefore it is proposed to align the relevant provisions of both these instruments as a consequence. It should be noted that for reasons of a legal nature, it is provided that the European Parliament should give a separate opinion on this proposal amending the DCI and on the parallel proposal amending the EIDHR."
4989EP7,"""""Drug precursors""""",0.895,0.864,0.07,0.548,0.545,0.916,0.846,0.229,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to prevent the diversion from the EU-internal trade of acetic anhydride, the main drug precursor for heroin, by extending the registration requirement to include users of the substance, and amending Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 on drug precursors PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: drug precursors are chemical substances having a wide variety of licit uses, such as in the synthesis of plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, perfumes, detergents, or aromas. They are traded for legitimate purposes on global markets, but some of them can also be diverted from the licit distribution channels for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs. Taking into account the wide legitimate uses of drug precursors, their trade cannot be prohibited. However, in order to prevent their diversion to illicit drug production, a specific regulatory framework has been set up on international level through Article 12 of the United Nations Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The EU is a Party to the Convention and has implemented its obligations through Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 governing the monitoring of the intra-EU trade in drug precursors and Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 governing the external trade. The Union regulatory framework provides for the monitoring and control of the legitimate trade in drug precursors. Operators, i.e. manufacturers, distributors, brokers, importers, exporters and wholesalers of chemicals engaged in the legitimate trade of drug precursors are required to take measures against theft, check their customers, detect suspicious transactions and notify the authorities thereof. In 2010, the European Commission adopted a Report on the implementation and functioning of the existing EU legislation on drug precursors, and recommended analysing ways to strengthen the control of the trade of acetic anhydride (scheduled substance in Category 2) in order to better prevent the diversion of acetic anhydride for the illicit production of heroin. Heroin use accounts for the greatest share of morbidity and mortality-related drug use in the EU. Even though the quantities of acetic anhydride seized in the EU have decreased very substantially since 2008, certain reports consider that the European legislative control measures are not sufficiently strict to prevent the diversion of the main heroin precursor from the intra-EU trade. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main problem driver being the insufficient control by competent authorities over all economic players involved in the legitimate trade with drug precursors, all policy options examined seek to improve control via enhanced reporting, notification or registration obligations imposed on the economic players. The impacts of the following six policy options have been analysed: Option 1 (baseline option): no action: the current EU legislation will remain unchanged; Option 2: strengthened reporting obligations; Option 3: strengthened rules and obligations on operators related to customer declarations from end-users; Option 4: require operators to systematically notify new end-users to the authorities to allow verification; Option 5: require registration for end-users and reinforce requirements regarding registration; Option 6: move acetic anhydride from category 2 to category 1 scheduled substances. Option 5 is the preferred option. The overall conclusion of the impact assessment was that both, Option 4 and Option 5 would be good choices, but Option 5 would be less burdensome than Option 4 in terms of annual costs for enterprises (provided authorities do not pass on all costs to registrants by imposing fees), an argument which is particular relevant for SMEs. All in all the strong political support which Option 5 has from most Member States, combined with views expressed on international level that a more systematic control of (all) acetic anhydride end-users is lacking in the European legislation, and the somewhat lower burden on SMEs tip the balance in favour of Option 5. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal aims to address a specific weakness which has been detected in the European Union, when large quantities of acetic anhydride (""AA""), the main drug precursor for heroin, were diverted from the EU- internal trade: in 2008, 75% of the global seizures of Acetic anhydride happened in the EU. Until now only EU companies producing or trading Acetic anhydride have to register with their national authorities. The Commission proposes to: · extend the registration requirement , which so far applies only to operators placing Acetic anhydride on the market, to include users of the substance; · enhance the harmonised registration provisions to achieve a more robust level playing field preserving the internal market and avoiding adoption of divergent national measures. More detailed rules on registration are introduced to ensure uniform conditions of registration in all Member States for scheduled substances in category 2 of Annex I. For substances scheduled in a new subcategory 2A of Annex I, not only operators but also users will be subject to a registration requirement. By ensuring that operators and users engaged in the legal trade of drug precursors are subject to harmonised rules, the proposal will ensure a proper functioning of the Union market by avoiding unnecessary barriers to such legitimate trade and by reducing administrative burdens for operators and competent authorities. Additionally the Commission proposes to establish and maintain a European Database on Drug Precursors in order to modernize the collection of the information provided by Member States on drug precursor seizures and stopped shipments, in accordance with current Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 273/2004, and to maintain a list of EU licensed or registered operators and users legally trading or using drug precursors, as well as to enable operators to provide competent authorities in summary form with information about their transactions involving scheduled substances in accordance with current Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 273/2004. In addition, it should be noted that the proposal is: · subject to a notification to the WTO in the framework of the TBT Agreement; · relevant for the European Economic Area (EEA); · contains a transitional period for the coming into force of the new registration obligations for end-users of Acetic anhydride; · includes a review clause to assess whether the amended Regulation will have been effective to prevent the diversion of Acetic anhydride. Annex: the proposal does not extend the provisions for acetic anhydride to other scheduled substances in category 2. Acetic anhydride, currently scheduled in category 2 of Annex I, will be included in a new subcategory 2A of Annex I to allow increased control of its trade. The remaining substances of category 2 will be listed as subcategory 2B. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the European Union budget because no additional resources are required to implement the action proposed. The necessary resources to implement the European database are already included in the allocations granted during the budget procedure and within the Internal Market line. DELEGATED ACTS: the Commission shall have the power, in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to adopt certain acts for which provision is made in the proposal."
459EP9,"""""EU-Switzerland Agreement on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime""""",0.903,0.868,0.986,0.836,0.456,0.981,0.929,0.049,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to conclude an agreement between the European Union and Switzerland on the application of certain provisions of Council Decision 2008/615/JHA and Council Decision 2008/616/JHA, as well as Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on combating terrorism and cross-border crime. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/615/JHA) and the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/616/JHA) are intended to improve the exchange of information between the services responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences and to strengthen cross-border police and judicial cooperation between the Member States of the Union. The Prüm Decision contains, inter alia, provisions whereby Member States grant one another, on a mutual basis, access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities (’the Forensic Decision’) lays down the requirements for the exchange of DNA and fingerprint data, in order to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within any other Member State. On 10 June 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Swiss Confederation on the application of certain provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision and the Decision on forensic services. These negotiations were successfully concluded and resulted in the initialling of the agreement on 24 May 2018. The possibility for all the Member States to have access to the national databases of the Swiss Confederation, regarding the DNA, dactyloscopic and vehicle registration data, and the other way around, is undoubtedly of central importance in order to foster and encourage the cross border police cooperation. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Switzerland for the application of some of the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision. This international agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation aims to improve and simplify the automated exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and the associated countries, in order to stimulate international police cooperation. The Agreement lists the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision that shall become applicable to the Swiss Confederation after entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement also sets the provisions for uniform application, dispute settlement, amendments, notifications and declarations. The contracting Parties agree to carry out common review of the agreement no later than five years after its entry into force. The Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period whilst one of the Contracting Parties can terminate the Agreement at any time. The United Kingdom and Ireland shall participate in the adoption and implementation of this Decision. Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application."
2547EP7,"""""Succession and the European Certificate of Succession""""",0.07,0.901,0.93,0.129,0.515,0.892,0.867,0.629,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to eliminate all the obstacles to the free movement of persons arising out of the differences between the rules of the Member States governing international successions. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he significance of cross-border successions within the European Union has been highlighted in the impact assessment attached to the proposal. The diversity of both the rules under substantive law and the rules of international jurisdiction or of applicable law, the multitude of authorities to which international succession matters can be referred and the fragmentation of successions which can result from these divergent rules are obstacles to the free movement of persons in the Union. Today, such persons are therefore faced with considerable difficulties in asserting their rights with regard to an international succession. These divergent rules also prevent the full exercise of private property law, which, in accordance with the settled case law of the Court of Justice, forms an integral part of the fundamental rights which the Court ensures are respected. The adoption of a European instrument in the area of successions was already one of the priorities of the 1998 Vienna Action Plan. The Hague Programme calls for the presentation of an instrument covering all the issues involved: applicable law, jurisdiction and recognition, administrative measures (certificates of inheritance, registration of wills). Before this proposal was drawn up, a wide-ranging consultation exercise took place within the Member States, the other institutions and the public. The Commission was sent a “Study on international successions in the European Union”, which had been drawn up by the German Institute of Notaries in November 2002. Its Green Paper on successions and wills , which was published on 1 March 2005, elicited 60 or so replies and was followed by a public hearing on 30 November 2006. The contributions received confirm the need for a Community instrument in this area and support the adoption of a proposal covering, among other things, questions concerning applicable law, jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of decisions and the creation of a European Certificate of Succession. The adoption of such an instrument has received the support of the European Parliament. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options have been split into the following two different sets, in order to take account of the different options to be considered: 1) Definition of policy options that address problems caused by national legislative differences concerning successions with transnational elements (Policy Options A) No common EU level action Policy Option A.1: Status quo. EU legislative action Policy Option A.2: Harmonisation of jurisdiction rules and introduction of rules on automatic recognition and enforcement of judgments, other decisions and authentic acts/deeds. Policy Option A.3: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules. Policy Option A.4: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and introduction of a European Certificate of Heir and Executor / Administrator in transnational successions. Policy Option A.5: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and jurisdiction rules. Policy Option A.6: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and jurisdiction rules, and introduction of rules on automatic recognition and enforcement of judgments, other decisions and authentic acts/deeds (A.2 plus A.3). Policy Option A.7: Harmonisation of conflict of law rules and jurisdiction rules, and introduction of rules on automatic recognition and enforcement of judgments, other decisions and authentic acts/deeds, and introduction of a Certificate of Heir and Executor /Administrator in transnational successions. Non-legislative action Policy Option A.8: Establishment of a database / knowledge management system on conflict of laws, jurisdiction rules and competent bodies. Policy Option A.9: EU wide information campaign on succession (legislation and existing /forthcoming instruments). 2) Definition of policy options that address problems of identifying wills abroad (Policy Options B) No common EU level action Policy Option B.1: Status quo EU level action (legislation and funding) Policy option B.2: Commission Recommendation on the establishment of interconnected national registers of wills and organisation of information campaigns. Policy option B.3 Compulsory establishment of interconnected national registers of wills. Policy option B.4 Establishment of a central EU Register of Wills. Non-legislative action Policy Option B.5: Creation of a webpage on existing registers of wills and national rules. Policy Option B.6: National information campaigns on wills (legislation and existing / forthcoming instruments). The preferred option is a combination of policy options A.7 and B.2 . A.7 is the preferred one as it would address most of the current problems and lead to the greatest cost reduction (maximum 30%). B.2 obtains is also preferred in that it takes account of the fact that the identification of wills is to a certain extent a national problem and is likely to remain such even in the long term (despite the trend towards citizens having increasing cross-border links). This preference is also in line with the rating made by the stakeholders. CONTENT: t he objective of this proposal is to enable people living in the European Union to organise their succession in advance and effectively to guarantee the rights of heirs and/or legatees and of other persons linked to the deceased, as well as creditors of the succession. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : t he concept of “succession” must be interpreted in an autonomous manner and encompasses all the elements of a succession, in particular its handover, administration and liquidation. This proposal shall apply to successions to the estates of deceased persons. It shall not apply to revenue, customs or administrative matters. Other areas to be excluded include: maintenance obligations; questions covered by company law; the constitution, functioning and dissolving of trusts; the nature of rights in rem relating to property and publicising these rights. Jurisdiction : the rules of legal jurisdiction relating to succession vary considerably between the Member States. This leads to positive conflicts, where the courts in several States declare themselves to be competent, or negative conflicts, where no court declares itself to be competent. In order to avoid these difficulties for citizens, a uniform rule is required. As regards applicable law , the choice to create a single scheme by means of a regulation allows the succession to be subjected to a single law, thereby avoiding these disadvantages. The proposal provides for the application of a single criterion for determining both the jurisdiction of the authorities and the law applicable to a cross-border succession: the deceased's habitual place of residence. People living abroad will, however, be able to opt to have the law of their country of nationality apply to the entirety of their succession. All assets making up a succession will thus be governed by one and the same law, thereby reducing the risk that different Member States will issue contradictory decisions. Likewise, a single authority - that of the country of habitual residence - will be competent for settling the succession; it will, however, be able to refer the matter to the competent authority of the country of nationality where the latter is better placed to hear the case. The Regulation has removed the possibility of choosing as the law applicable to succession the law applicable to matrimonial property scheme of the testator. Such a provision would have allowed multiple choices where, for the matrimonial property schemes, the spouses benefit from greater flexibility in their choice of applicable law. The proposal includes rules governing the law applicable to the agreements as to succession and joint wills used in certain States, e.g. in order to organise the transfer of a company and for couples to allow the surviving spouse to benefit from joint property. The proposal also includes an Article which takes into account the specific features of common law legal systems, such as the English legal system, where the heirs do not directly acquire the rights of the deceased upon the latter's death but where the succession is managed by an administrator appointed and supervised by the judge. Lastly, recourse to public policy must occur in exceptional circumstances only. Differences between the laws relating to the protection of the legitimate interests of the relatives of the deceased must not be used to justify its use, as this would be incompatible with the objective of ensuring the application of a single law to all of the succession property. Recognition and enforcement : p rovision is made for the recognition of all the decisions and legal transactions in order to give substance in succession matters to the principle of mutual recognition, which is based on the principle of mutual trust. The grounds for non-recognition have therefore been kept to the necessary minimum. Authentic instruments : in view of the practical importance of authentic instruments in succession matters, this Regulation should ensure their recognition in order to allow their free movement. This recognition means that they will enjoy the same full and complete evidentiary effect in respect of the contents of the recorded instruments and the facts contained therein as that of national authentic instruments or on the same basis as in their country of origin, a presumption of authenticity, and an enforceable nature within the limits set by this Regulation. European Certificate of Succession : in order to enable international successions to be settled rapidly, this Regulation introduces a European Certificate of Succession. To facilitate its circulation in the Union, a uniform model certificate should be adopted and an authority appointed which would have the international competence to issue it. This certificate does not replace existing certificates in certain Member States. In the Member State of the competent authority, the capacity of heir and the powers of an administrator or executor of the succession must therefore be proven according to the domestic procedure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Community budget."
555EP7,"""""Transportable pressure equipment""""",0.649,0.853,0.684,0.613,0.333,0.904,0.851,0.629,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to set out detailed rules concerning transportable pressure equipment to enhance safety and ensure free movement of such equipment within the Community. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the transport of pressure equipment, e. g. tanks, receptacles, drums and cylinders, constitutes an important area of the transport of dangerous goods. Council Directive 1999/36/EC ensures a high level of transport safety for transportable pressure equipment whilst allowing their free movement and use on the European transport market through common norms for their design, construction and subsequent checks. For the technical requirements, the existing Directive 1999/36/EC refers to Directives 94/55/EC and 96/49/EC, which have been repealed by Directive 2008/68/EC with effect of 1 July 2009 . Directive 2008/68/EC incorporates into Community legislation the requirements contained in international agreements on transport of dangerous goods by road (ADR: European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road), rail (RID: Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail) and inland waterways (ADN: European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Inland Waterways). As a result of these recent legislative developments, which in turn reflect technical developments over the last 10 years, the EU rules have become complicated and difficult to understand. In addition, on a number of technical issues the interplay between European and international rules will lead to certain contradictions which would make their application even more difficult. The second key objective of the proposal concerns the use of the equipment itself for transport operations in the internal market. In view of these facts it is necessary to revise Directive 1999/36/EC. CONTENT: this proposed Directive sets out detailed rules concerning transportable pressure equipment to enhance safety and ensure free movement of such equipment within the Community. It defines a number of terms regarding transportable pressure equipment, actors and measures guaranteeing the safety of the equipment and its use on the internal market. The need for simplification and clarification is the main reason for the Commission to propose this revision. Neither the scope, nor the measures of the existing Directive will be changed in any substantial way. This also results in minimal budgetary and other economic impacts on administration and operators. As for the technical provisions, a central simplification objective is to remove conflicting issues between the existing Directive on Transportable Pressure Equipment and international rules on the transport of dangerous goods, in particular since these rules have already been extended to Community legislation through Directive 2008/68/EC. The proposal simplifies existing provisions, in particular those relating to the modules on conformity assessment procedures. This dimension will be substantially streamlined and simplified in the proposal, which makes reference to the relevant international agreements. The technical rules and administrative procedures are more consistently presented in one source, i.e. in the international agreements. The proposed Directive focuses on those issues that can be treated satisfactorily only through European legislation. As for making the equipment required for transport operations available on the market, the Community has recently adopted rules relating to the marketing of products on the EU single market (""New Legislative Framework"") which should, wherever possible, be applied across all industrial sectors (see COD/2007/0029 and COD/2007/0030). By incorporating these rules into the proposal for the specific sector of transportable pressure equipment the Commission will help to simplify the rules by not creating different, sector-specific rules where the general rules would serve the purpose. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: given that the provisions of the existing Directive on transportable pressure equipment are already implemented, any further budgetary implications will be minor."
3407EP7,"""""Macro-financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic""""",0.807,0.857,0.0,0.323,0.242,0.904,0.846,0.086,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to provide a macro-financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for an amount of €30 million. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the marked deceleration in growth experienced by the Kyrgyz economy in 2009 (GDP slowed down from an average rate of 8.5% in 2007-08 to 2.3% in 2009) was a consequence of several external shocks, including a fall in remittances from migrant workers, lower demand for exports and shrinking direct and other foreign investments. Before the dramatic events of 2010, economic growth was expected to rebound in 2010 to 4.5-5.5%. However, the 2010 April popular revolt and, more importantly, the escalation of the ethnic conflict in June led to a serious deterioration in the economic outlook. Economic activity contracted by 10% in the second quarter of 2010. In response to last year's political events and their economic implications, the international community organised a High Level Donors Meeting for the Kyrgyz Republic on 27 July 2010 in Bishkek. At this conference, donors committed to provide USD 1.1 billion in emergency support by the end of 2011. The EU was among the major donors, pledging €117.9 million for support in a number of critical areas. The IMF in June 2011 agreed with the Kyrgyz authorities on an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) of SDR 66.6 million (USD 106 million) in support of a three-year programme of macroeconomic adjustment and structural reforms. In 2010, the President and the Minister of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic formally requested the EU macro-financial assistance (MFA) to complement the support from the IMF. In this context, the Commission has assessed the macroeconomic situation and financing needs of the Kyrgyz Republic. The main conclusions of the assessment are that last year’s tragic political events and the related social and reconstruction expenditure have left important external and fiscal financing needs for the period 2011-12. While these needs are being partly covered by the international community, there are still substantial residual needs. In order to supplement the resources made available by the IMF, the Commission proposes providing a MFA in the amount of up to EUR 30 million to the Kyrgyz Republic to be disbursed half in loans and half in grants. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the impact assessment, t he MFA and the economic adjustment and reform programme attached to it will help alleviate the Kyrgyz Republic's short-term financing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening medium-term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability and raising sustainable growth as agreed with the IMF. It will notably help improve the efficiency and transparency of public finance management. LEGAL BASIS: Article 209 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: it is proposed that the European Union shall make macro-financial assistance available to the Kyrgyz Republic for a maximum amount of €30 million, with a view to supporting the country's economic stabilisation and covering its balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF programme. Of this amount, up to €15 million shall be provided in the form of loans and up to €15 million in the form of grants. The release of the proposed macro-financial assistance is subject to the approval of the 2012 Budget by the budgetary authority. The conditions attached the granting of the macro-financial assistance shall be consistent with the principles and fundamental objectives of the Union policy as regards this country. These are as follows: the Commission is empowered to borrow the necessary resources on behalf of the European Union in order to finance the loan component of the Union's macro-financial assistance; the loan shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years; the assistance shall be made available for two years; the release of the Union's financial assistance shall be managed by the Commission; specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable; the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place in the first semester of 2012. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the second semester of 2012; the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the IMF's financial arrangement (the ECF); the Commission and the Kyrgyz authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. It should be noted that the decision to disburse half of the proposed assistance in grants and the other half in loans is justified by Kyrgyz level of development (as measured by its per-capita income) and debt indicators. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the grant element of the assistance (€15 million) would be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2012 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), with payments taking place in 2012. In line with the Guarantee Fund Regulation, the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund is expected to take place in 2014 and to amount to a maximum of €1.35 million. This corresponds to 9% of the €15 million loan expected to be disbursed in 2012."
10129EP8,"""""Computerising the movement and surveillance of excise goods""""",0.829,0.796,0.94,0.688,0.135,0.925,0.827,0.808,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to provide a base for the governance of further automations of processes defined by Union excise legislation. PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision No 1152/2003/EC is the founding decision for the computerised system (Excise Movement and Control System – EMCS). At the moment it covers only movements of excise goods under excise duty suspension. In order to allow the automation of the procedure for the movement of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State, Decision No 1152/2003/EC has to be modified. Since most provisions of the Decisions are affected by such modification, the Decision should be recast in the interests of clarity. This proposal accompanies the proposal for a Council Directive laying down the general arrangement for excise duty as regards the automation of the procedure for movements of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and that are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State. CONTENT: the objective of the proposal is to extend the excise movement and control system to intra EU movements of excise goods that are released for consumption, in order to simplify the procedure and allow for proper monitoring of such movements, and to provide a base for the governance of further automations of processes defined by Union excise legislation, where such automation is considered beneficial. It is proposed to amend most of the provisions of Decision No 1152/2003/EC so as to allow the possibility of automating any procedure used for the movement and control of excise goods. Specifically, the computerised system is intended to: permit the electronic transmission of the accompanying documents and the improvement of checks; improve the functioning of the internal market, by simplifying the intra-Union movement of excise goods and affording Member States the possibility of monitoring the flows in real time and of carrying out the requisite checks where necessary."
716EP7,"""""Rights to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings""""",0.632,0.901,0.912,0.484,0.273,0.904,0.897,0.829,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to lay down rules concerning the rights to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings and proceedings for the execution of a European Arrest Warrant. PROPOSED ACT: Initiative of Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria, Portugal, Romania, Finland and Sweden for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 November 2000 the Council, in accordance with the Tampere Conclusions, adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. Mutual recognition can only operate effectively in a spirit of confidence, whereby not only judicial authorities, but all actors in the criminal process see decisions of the judicial authorities of other Member States as equivalent to their own, implying not only trust in the adequacy of one's partners' rules, but also trust that those rules are correctly applied. Although all Member States are parties to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), experience has shown that this in itself does not always provide a sufficient degree of trust in the criminal justice systems of other Member States. Common minimum rules should lead to increased confidence in the criminal justice systems of all Member States, which in turn should lead to more efficient judicial cooperation in a climate of mutual trust. Such common minimum rules should be applied in the fields of interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in view of the step-by-step approach set out in the Roadmap, the Commission presented on 8 July 2009 a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the right to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings. This proposal was accompanied by an Impact Assessment. This impact assessment is re-submitted as ""detailed statement"" allowing to appraise compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, in view of the presentation by Member States of an initiative for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the rights to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings. Five options are set out as follows: · Option 1 : status quo; · Option 2 : adoption of non-legislative measures (such as recommendations) to exchange best practices and to establish Community guidelines; · Option 3 : new instrument covering all rights; · Option 4 : legislative measures restricted to the cross-border cases; · Option 5 : step-by-step approach beginning with legislative measures on access to interpretation and translation services (withdrawing the current proposal for a Framework Decision and proposing a new Framework Decision requiring Member States to provide minimum standards only for access to interpretation and translation services). Option 5 could provide scope for a longer term action plan for the progressive approximation of laws in the area of procedural rights taking account of practical aspects either. This approach would not be as dependent on the Lisbon Treaty as option 3. This option would result in an improvement in the quality and provision of interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. It would ensure a fairer trial in cases where the suspect does not understand the criminal proceedings, his rights or the full charges before him. The option would place an additional financial and administrative burden on Member States that currently do not offer training to legal interpreters and translators. CONTENT: the proposal lays down rules concerning the rights to interpretation and to translation in criminal proceedings and proceedings for the execution of a European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Those rights apply to any person from the time that person is made aware by the competent authorities of a Member State that he is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence until the conclusion of the proceedings, which is understood to mean the final determination of the question whether the suspected or accused person has committed the offence. The Directive will not apply to proceedings which may lead to sanctions being imposed by an authority other than a criminal court, as long as those proceedings are not pending before a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters. Right to interpretation : a suspected or accused person who does not understand or speak the language of the criminal proceedings concerned must be provided with interpretation into his native language or into another language that he understands, in order to safeguard his right to fair proceedings. Interpretation, including of communications between the suspected or accused person and his legal counsel, shall be provided during criminal proceedings before investigative and judicial authorities, including during police questioning, during all court hearings and during any necessary interim hearings, and may be provided in other situations. This provision will not affect rules of national law concerning the presence of a legal counsel during any stage of the criminal proceedings. A person with a hearing impediment must receive interpretation assistance, if appropriate for that person. Member States must ensure that it is verified in any appropriate manner, including by consulting the suspected or accused person, whether he understands and speaks the language of the criminal proceedings and needs the assistance of an interpreter. At some stage in the proceedings, in accordance with national law, there must be the possibility of a review of a finding that there is no need for interpretation. Such review does not entail the obligation for Member States to provide for a separate mechanism in which the sole ground for review is the challenging of such finding. In proceedings for the execution of a EAW, the executing Member State shall ensure that its competent authorities provide any person subject to such proceedings who does not understand or speak the language of the proceedings, with interpretation. Right to translation of essential documents : a suspected or accused person who does not understand the language of the criminal proceedings concerned must be provided with a translation, into his native language or into another language that he understands, of all documents which are essential in order to safeguard his right to fair proceedings, or at least the important passages of such documents, provided that the person concerned has the right of access to the documents concerned under national law. The competent authorities must decide which the essential documents to be translated are. The latter must include at least detention orders or equivalent decisions depriving the person of his liberty, the charge or indictment and any judgment, where such documents exist. The suspected person may submit a reasoned request for translation of further documents which are necessary for the effective exercise of the right of defence. There must be the possibility of a review if translation of a document referred to above is not provided. Such review does not entail the obligation for Member States to provide for a separate mechanism in which the sole ground for review is the challenging of such finding. In proceedings for the execution of an EAW, the executing Member State shall ensure that its competent authorities provide any person subject to such proceedings who does not understand the language in which the European Arrest Warrant is drawn up, or into which it has been translated by the issuing Member State, with a translation of that document. Provided that this does not affect the fairness of the proceedings, an oral translation or an oral summary of the documents may be provided instead of a written translation. A person who has a right to translation of documents may, at any time, waive this right. Costs : Member States shall cover the costs of interpretation and translation resulting from the application of the above provisions, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings. Quality of the interpretation and translation : concrete measures must be taken to ensure that the interpretation and translation provided shall be of adequate quality so that the suspected or accused person, as well as a person subject to the execution of a EAW, is fully able to exercise his rights. Non-regression clause : it should be ensured that setting common minimum standards in accordance with this Directive does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the standards set in the ECHR or other relevant international agreements are maintained. Member States remain entirely at liberty to set standards higher than those agreed in this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 48 of Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as amended by a Regulation (EU, Euratom) of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice, provides that the General Court, consisting of 40 Judges as from the date of entry into force of the amending Regulation, will consist of 47 Judges as from 1 September 2016, and of two Judges per Member State as from 1 September 2019. Increasing by seven the number of Judges of the General Court on 1 September 2016 will also require jurisdiction at first instance in disputes between the Union and its servants to be transferred to the General Court, which presupposes, the dissolution of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal (CST). CONTENT: the draft Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council set out below is based on Article 256(1) TFEU, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 TFEU, the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU, and Article 106a(1) EAEC. The proposed text: 1) repeals Council Decision 2004/752/EC, Euratom establishing the European Union Civil Service Tribunal and, in consequence thereof, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 979/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to temporary Judges of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal; 2) introduces two new Articles into the Statute of the Court seeking to: set out that the General Court shall exercise at first instance jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and its servants, including disputes between all institutions and all bodies, offices or agencies, on the one hand, and their servants, on the other, in respect of which jurisdiction is conferred on the Court of Justice of the European Union; enable the court responsible for civil service disputes to examine, at all stages of the procedure, the possibilities of amicable settlement of disputes. A new Article provides, in general terms, that the provisions relating to the jurisdiction, composition, organisation and procedure of any specialised court established under Article 257 TFEU are to be contained in an Annex to the Statute. 3) governs the procedure for dealing with cases pending before the Civil Service Tribunal (‘CST’) on 31 August 2016 , which are to be transferred, on 1 September 2016, to the General Court. The General Court should continue dealing with those cases as it finds them at that date, the procedural steps taken by the CST in those cases remaining applicable. In the event of a case being transferred to the General Court after the hearing, the oral part of the procedure would be reopened; 4) lays down a transitional regime in respect of appeals under examination when jurisdiction is transferred on 1 September 2016, or brought after that date, against decisions of the CST. The General Court is to continue to have jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeals. Accordingly, Articles 9 to 12 of Annex I to the Statute of the Court must remain applicable to the proceedings concerned. If the General Court sets aside a decision of the CST but considers that the state of the proceedings does not permit a decision, it is to refer the case to a chamber other than that which ruled on the appeal (that is to say, the Appeal Chamber). Lastly, the proposal sets the date on which the transfer of jurisdiction to the General Court to rule at first instance on disputes between the Union and its servants is to take effect as 1 September 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland annexed to the Withdrawal Agreement reiterates that Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom, and that nothing in the Protocol prevents the United Kingdom from including Northern Ireland in the territorial scope of its Schedules of Concessions annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (‘GATT 1994’). This means that despite Northern Ireland being formally in the United Kingdom’s customs territory, the United Kingdom, in respect of Northern Ireland, is obliged to apply the Union’s customs legislation as if Northern Ireland were still in the Union’s customs territory. The bilateral arrangements between the Union and the United Kingdom under the Protocol do not give rise to rights and obligations for third countries. Consequently, any imports pursuant to Union import tariff rate quotas or other import quotas applying to goods originating in a third country brought into Northern Ireland could not be counted towards that third country’s rights vis-à-vis the Union, unless agreed by the third country. That situation poses a risk to the proper functioning of the Union’s Single Market and the integrity of the Common Commercial Policy through the possible circumvention of the Union’s tariff rate quotas or other import quotas. To address that risk, the Union’s import tariff rate quotas and other import quotas should be available only for goods imported and released into free circulation in the Union and not in Northern Ireland. Any agreement of the Union with a third country providing for export tariff rate quotas applies only to goods imported within the Union. Therefore, that third country could refuse to issue export licenses for direct imports into Northern Ireland. By virtue of the Protocol, this Regulation also applies to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland. CONTENT: under the proposed Regulation, the Union’s tariff rate quotas and other import quotas on imports should be available only for goods imported from outside of the Union and released into free circulation in the Union. The proposal lists the relevant customs territories, which make up the Union customs territory. This list does not include Northern Ireland, which has the effect that the Union’s tariff rate quotas and other import quotas would not be available for imports into Northern Ireland. The Regulation should start the day following the end of transition period, on 1 January 2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 31 March 2016, the Council adopted negotiating directives which authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the European Union, an international agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the delegations from Canada, China, Denmark in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Russia and the United States of America with a view to concluding a binding Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. The Agreement seeks to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the high seas portion of the central Arctic Ocean, an area that is roughly 2.8 million square kilometres in size. Commercial fishing has never been known to occur in this area, nor is it likely to occur in the near future. However, given the changing conditions of the Arctic Ocean, the governments in question developed this Agreement in accordance with the precautionary approach to fisheries management. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. Becoming a Party to the Agreement will promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long term conservation and sustainable use of marine biological resources globally. The Agreement will establish and operate a joint programme of scientific research and monitoring with the aim of improving the understanding of the ecosystem(s) of this area and, in particular, of determining whether fish stocks might exist in this area that could be harvested on a sustainable basis. Once entered into force, the Agreement will close an important regulatory gap in the current International ocean governance framework."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union using the procedure provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The Withdrawal Agreement contains arrangements for the application of provisions of Union law to and in the United Kingdom beyond the date the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. If that agreement enters into force, the common fisheries policy (CFP) will apply to and in the United Kingdom during the transition period in accordance with that agreement and will cease to apply at the end of that period. Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for vessels in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country and for third country fishing vessels conducting fishing operations in Union waters. Regulation (EU) 2019/498 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, adopted un March 2019 with a date of application until 31 December 2019. It provides a simplified legal framework to allow the Union to grant authorisations to United Kingdom vessels to enter Union waters and to manage authorisation requests for EU vessels entering United Kingdom waters, should reciprocal access rights to waters be confirmed and in line with the applicable rules on fishing opportunities. Such a temporary framework remains necessary for 2020 in the absence of a fisheries agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom in its new status of third country, and taking into account that the United Kingdom will not be part of Union decision making beyond the Commission Proposal on fishing opportunities (scheduled for October 2019) unless a new extension of the Article 50(3) period is requested by the United Kingdom and agreed by the European Council (Article 50). CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the period of application of these provisions to enable the issuance of fishing authorisations in each other’s waters in absence of a fisheries agreement concluded with the United Kingdom as a third country, provided that the management of the relevant stocks remains sustainable and in accordance with the conditions set out in the common fisheries policy and in the Council Regulations establishing fishing opportunities. Should the Withdrawal Agreement not be ratified by 31 October 2019, and should the United Kingdom withdraw from the Union on 1 November 2019, it may not be feasible for the United Kingdom and the Union to conclude a common arrangement on the fishing opportunities for relevant stocks concerned for 2020 in time for the meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December 2019 which is scheduled to set the fishing opportunities for the following year. The absence of a common arrangement however does not as such prevent the United Kingdom and the Union from granting access to each other’s waters. In that case, they would be able to issue fishing authorisations to each other's vessels provided they both meet the conditions for sustainable management of the relevant stocks. United Kingdom fishing vessels may carry out fishing operations in Union waters in accordance with the conditions set out in the Council Regulations establishing fishing opportunities for 2019 and 2020, provided that the fishing opportunities set by both the Union and the United Kingdom combined are in line with the sustainable management of the relevant stocks in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The territorial scope of this Regulation and any reference to the United Kingdom therein does not include Gibraltar. This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply from the day following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom, unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date. It should apply until 31 December 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2003 on measures that the Community may take in relation to the combined effect of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard measures. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Regulation establishes specific provisions to enable the Commission, where it considers it appropriate, to take action to avoid that a combination of anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures with safeguard tariff measures on one and the same product could place an undesirably onerous burden on certain exporting producers seeking to export to the Union, which may have the effect of denying them access to the Union market. The Commission may consider it appropriate to: (i) amend, suspend or repeal antidumping and/or anti-subsidy measures or: (ii) provide for exemptions in whole or in part from any anti-dumping or countervailing duties which would otherwise be payable, or: (iii) adopt any other special measures. Any suspension or amendment of, or exemption from, anti-dumping or anti-subsidy measures should be granted only for a limited period of time."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: based on a mandate from the Council, the European Commission has negotiated with the Republic of Cape Verde to renew the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Cape Verde, dated 19 December 2006. Following these negotiations, a new protocol was initialled on 22 December 2010, covering a period of three years starting from 1 September 2011, since the protocol currently in force will expire on 31 August 2011 (see CNS/2006/0122). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. The Commission’s negotiating position was based in part on the results of an ex-post evaluation carried out by external experts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal for a Decision relates to the conclusion of a new Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Cape Verde. The objective is to continue the cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde to create a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and to ensure the sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Cape Verde fishing zone, which is in the interests of both Parties. Financial contribution : t he overall annual contribution of the Protocol of EUR 1 305 000 over the whole period is based on: a) an annual reference tonnage fixed at 5 000 tonnes for 74 vessels, corresponding to EUR 325 000 per year, and b) support for the development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of Cape Verde amounting to EUR 110 000 per year. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy. The reference tonnage has been kept unchanged at 5 000 tonnes/year. Nevertheless, taking account of needs in the fisheries sector in Cape Verde, the budget allocated to sectoral support has increased in comparison with the previous Protocol. The annual financial contribution has increased by EUR 50 000 (+ 13%) in comparison with the previous Protocol (2006-11). Fishing authorisation : the new Agreement grants fishing authorisations to the tuna category alone. Fishing opportunities : 28 tuna seiners, 35 surface longliners and 11 pole-and-line vessels will be authorised to fish. Advances and fees payable by shipowners : EUR 35 per tonne of tuna caught in the Cape Verde fishing area by seiners and surface longliners and EUR 25 per tonne for pole-andline vessels. The annual advances are set at EUR 4 375 per tuna seiner, EUR 3 150 per longliner and EUR 450 per pole-and-line vessel. Period of application : for a period of three years from 1 September 2011. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION : the overall annual contribution of the Protocol of EUR 1 305 000 from 2011 to 2013, that is EUR 435 000/year (administrative expenditure excluded). The financial envelope of EUR 264 600 is provided for administrative expenditure. It should be noted that the advances and fees have no impact on the EU’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant drop in demand which in turn has led to a sharp drop in rail transport. Demand for both passenger and freight services for the whole of 2020 is expected to be well below 2019 levels. The pandemic may lead to a large number of insolvencies and liquidity shortages within the railway sector. It affects all the supply chain and has effects on railway undertakings, shippers and logistic enterprises. Infrastructure managers and service facility operators will also suffer from its financial consequences. The rail sector makes a vital contribution to the European economy as a whole and to employment, directly employing more than 1 million people, of whom around 600 000 are employed in railway undertakings and 440 000 in infrastructure managers (by the end of 2016). Rail transport is also a key element of the EU's strategy to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, ensure economic and social cohesion and connecting Europeans within and between Member States. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a Single European Railway Area does not allow Member States, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, to respond to the unpredictable effects on rail transport by adapting, in particular, the rules on charging and capacity allocation. Targeted derogations should therefore be allowed in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on rail transport and to preserve the integrity of the single European railway area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation is intended to complete the existing rail-related framework in order to allow national authorities and rail stakeholders to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the urgent needs of the railway sector as long as those consequences persist. These temporary emergency measures concern notably the waiver, reduction or deferral of track access charges for the use of rail infrastructure, as well as the waiver of reservation charges. They cover a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, in respect of which charges may be altered, by derogation from Article 27 of Directive 2012/34/EU whereby the network statement (displaying all applicable charges) shall be published no less than for months in advance for the deadline for requests for infrastructure capacity. Income losses on the part of infrastructure managers as a result of the reductions envisaged in the proposed Regulation shall be reimbursed by Member States by 31 December of the year following the year in which the loss was incurred at the latest. The Commission may, by means of delegated acts, extend the time period during which the measures envisaged by the proposed Regulation apply."
3711EP7,"""""Alternative consumer dispute resolution""""",0.93,0.897,0.912,0.677,0.303,0.795,0.872,0.0,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to contribute to the functioning of the internal market and to the achievement of a high level of consumer protection by ensuring that disputes between consumers and traders can be submitted to entities offering impartial, transparent, effective and fair alternative dispute resolution procedures. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a substantial proportion of European consumers encounter problems when buying goods and services in the internal market. In 2010, this was the case for approximately 20% of European consumers. These problems are often left unresolved. The losses incurred by European consumers because of problems with purchased goods or services are estimated at 0.4% of the EU GDP. The Commission has adopted two Recommendations on consumer ADR and established two networks dealing with ADR (ECC-NET and FIN-Net). A number of EU sector-specific legislation contains a clause on ADR and Directive 2008/52/CE (the Mediation Directive) promotes the amicable settlement of disputes, including consumer disputes. However, the analysis of the current situation identified the following main shortcomings which hinder the effectiveness of ADR: gaps in the coverage, the lack of consumer and business awareness as well as the uneven quality of ADR procedures. The lack of effective ADR poses particular challenges in the context of cross-border transactions (e.g. language barriers, potentially higher costs, differences in legislation between Member States). In view of the problems identified, the Commission undertook to propose measures on ADR that ensure that all consumer complaints can be submitted to an ADR entity and that disputes arising from cross-border transactions could be more easily resolved. A proposal for a regulation on establishing a European platform facilitating out-of-court resolution of disputes is presented at the same time as this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has carried out a detailed impact assessment, analysing a range of policy options for (i) ADR coverage, information and quality and(ii) ODR for cross-border e-commerce transactions. The impact assessment concluded that only a combination of two instruments on ADR and ODR can ensure access to impartial, transparent, effective and fair means to resolve domestic and cross-border consumer disputes out-of-court. A Framework Directive is the most appropriate way to ensure full ADR coverage in all Member States. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal aims to ensure that that disputes between consumers and traders can be submitted to entities offering impartial, transparent, effective and fair alternative dispute resolution procedures. The main points of the proposal are as follows: Ensuring that ADR procedures exist for all consumer disputes : Member States must ensure that all disputes between a consumer and a trader arising from the sale of goods or the provision of services can be submitted to an ADR entity, including through online means. The proposal applies to ADR entities that seek to resolve disputes between consumers and traders out-of-court through the intervention of a dispute resolution entity. It covers in particular mediation procedures but also non-judicial procedures of an adjudicatory nature, such as procedures before consumer complaint boards, arbitration and conciliation procedures. The proposal does not apply to consumer complaint handling systems operated by the trader nor to dispute resolution entities where the natural persons in charge of dispute resolution are employed exclusively by the trader. It also excludes direct negotiations between the parties. Information on ADR and cooperation : consumers must be able to find information on the competent ADR entity in the main commercial documents provided by the trader and, where a trader has a website, on that website. In addition, traders will have to inform consumers on whether or not they commit to use ADR in relation to complaints lodged against them by a consumer. Member States shall ensure that consumers can obtain assistance when they are involved in a cross-border dispute. They may delegate responsibility for this task to their centres of the European Consumer Centre Network (ECC-net), which currently performs the function of guiding consumers to the ADR entities competent to deal with their cross-border disputes. ADR entities will be encouraged to become members of networks of ADR entities in sector-specific areas when they deal with disputes in that area. The proposal contains provisions ensuring the respect of strict guarantees of confidentiality and data protection, in compliance with the relevant Union legislation. Quality of ADR entities : the proposal aims at ensuring that ADR entities respect the quality principles of impartiality, transparency, effectiveness and fairness. It provides that the parties should receive all the information they need to take an informed decision before engaging in an ADR procedure. Based on the results of existing studies, the proposal requires that disputes should be resolved within 90 days. It also provides that they should be free of charge or of moderate costs for consumers. Monitoring : in each Member State, a competent authority will be in charge of monitoring the functioning of ADR entities established on its territory. The competent authorities will inter alia assess, on the basis of information notified to them by ADR entities, whether a given ADR entity respects the quality requirements laid down by the proposal. In addition, the competent authorities will publish regular reports on the development and functioning of ADR entities. Every three years, the Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the School Milk Scheme and the School Fruit Scheme have developed independently and in different time periods: the School Milk Scheme has been implemented since 1977, and the School Fruit Scheme came out of a political commitment in the context of the 2007 reform of the Common Market Organisation for fruit and vegetables. The current schemes operate within different legal and financial frameworks, and have some important differences in their design and functioning. The Commission proposes changes to the programmes in order to make them more efficient, and better respond to the overarching problems of declining fruit and vegetable and milk consumption and rising obesity. Furthermore, the Commission made a commitment in the context of the adoption of Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 to review the financing arrangements of the current schemes, namely aid for the distribution of milk as well as the co-financing of the school fruit scheme costs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three options considered, the option chosen is the ""new framework"" scenario that entails a considerable policy change in the form of a common legal and financing framework for the distribution of a restricted number of products, complemented by an orientation towards the long-term objectives through a strengthened educational dimension of the scheme. CONTENT: it is proposed to establish a common legal and financial framework for the distribution of fruit and vegetables and milk to children in schools, supported by strengthened educational measures to reaffirm the link with agriculture, as well as wider issues such as public health and environmental matters. The proposal sets out the key elements of the new scheme. 1) Distribution : it is proposed to focus the distribution of products in schools to two ""core products"": fresh fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and drinking milk only, with the fat content of drinking milk to be decided upon by national health authorities. The distribution will take place within a fixed budget, and will help reverse the declining consumption trends for these two groups of products. 2) Unify the financial provisions and improve financing conditions : in view of the differences between the products and their supply chains, as well as different consumption situation across the Member States, separate ""envelopes"" would be allocated to Member States for fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and milk. The envelope for fruit and vegetables is EUR 150 million and the envelope for milk is EUR 80 million. Certain flexibility is provided for, where Member States can transfer limited shares of their allocations between the envelopes based on their needs. Accordingly, without exceeding the global ceiling of EUR 230 million Member States may transfer up to 15% of their indicative allocations for fruit and vegetables including bananas or for milk to the other sector under conditions to be specified by the Commission by means of delegated acts Within the envelopes, thresholds are established for supporting measures and other eligible measures, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication. Based on experience gained so far, the level of EU contribution towards the price of products is limited through a maximum EU aid per portion for fruit and vegetables and for milk, and not through the EU co-financing levels, as was the case for the School Fruit Scheme. This would be a new element for fruit and vegetables, which would help alleviate the huge disparities in price for products distributed and would imply a simplification in terms of a management. The level of EU subsidy for milk is increased. Member States will be allowed to continue providing national top-ups or attract private funding in order to enlarge the scope and/or the intensity of their intervention of the school schemes. The aid will be allocated to each Member State taking into account certain criteria including (i) the number of six- to ten-year old children as a proportion of the population, (ii) the degree of development of the regions within a Member State so to ensure higher aid to less developed regions and (iii) for milk, the historical use of funds. Reinforce the educational dimension : supporting educational measures will also become a requirement for milk distribution, thus bridging the gap between the current schemes. These measures will have a focus on agricultural issues, nutrition/health (balanced diets) and environmental matters and aim to connect children with food, agricultural production and farmers. Member States could choose thematic educational measures that could occasionally include agricultural products, other than the two core products, such as yoghurts, processed fruit and vegetables, honey, or olive oil. The list of all products supplied under the scheme and their nutritional aspects have to be approved by national health authorities. Supporting educational measures would have to be directly linked to the agricultural objectives of the scheme and be in line with the objective of promoting healthy diets. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact of the proposal is budgetary neutral compared to the current situation. For fruit and vegetables , the budgetary ceiling currently set in Regulation No 1308/2013 (EUR 150 million per school year) is maintained in this proposal. For milk , the proposal includes an envelope of EUR 80 million per school year, corresponding to the expected budget execution and in line with the overall amounts for market-related expenditure and direct aids taken into account in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. As regards distribution of expenditure, the greatest support will be given to the distribution and supporting educational measures. Other costs, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication, will also be eligible to a more limited extent. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: there is an alarming increase in the EU of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source. These products are, from the point of view of EU pharmaceutical legislation, illegal insofar as they do not comply with the Community rules for medicinal products. Moreover, the number of falsifications of innovative and life-saving medicines is increasing. In this way, in 2007, many thousand packs of falsified life-saving drugs reached patients in the EU. The underlying causes for falsified medicinal products remaining undetected in the legal supply chain are manifold, but can be reduced to four aspects: (i) falsified medicinal products can not always be easily distinguished from originals; (ii) the distribution chain has become very complex and is only as strong as its weakest link; (iii) there are legal uncertainties as to the regime applicable to products introduced into the EU while allegedly not being placed on the market; (iv) lastly, already the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) entering the manufacturing process may be a falsification of the original API. The existing provisions of Directive 2001/83/EC are in some respects insufficient to address these concrete causes. In view of the time span between the proposal for amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC and their effective implementation, there is a clear need for the Commission to act now. CONTENT: in order to address the risk of falsified medicinal products entering the legal supply chain, the Commission proposes a number of amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC. These include: certain obligations for stakeholders other than wholesale distributors, who are involved in the distribution chain. These stakeholders are typically involved in the transactions without actually handling the products (for example, by auctioning or brokering products); a legal basis for the Commission to render obligatory specific safety-features (such as a serial number or a seal) on the packaging of prescription-medicines; a prohibition in principle of manipulating (i.e. removing, tampering with, or over-labelling) safety features on the packaging by stakeholders situated “in-between” the original manufacturer and the last stakeholder in the distribution chain (typically the pharmacist) or end user (doctor/patient); compulsory audits of wholesale distributors of medicinal products in order to ensure reliability of business partners; strengthened requirements for imports of API from third countries if it could not be established that the regulatory framework in the respective third country ensures a sufficient level of protection of human health for products exported to the EU; audits of manufacturers of API; stricter rules for inspections including increased transparency of inspection results through publication in the EudraGMP database managed by the EMEA."
7467EP8,"""""Structural Reform Support Programme: financial envelope and general objective""""",0.686,0.833,0.82,0.042,0.096,0.776,0.817,0.019,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to increase the financial envelope of the structural reform support programme and to adapt its general objective. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/825 of the European Parliament and of the Council established a structural reform support programme for the period 2017-2020, with a budget of EUR 142.8 million. Its objective is to strengthen the capacity of Member States to prepare and implement growth-sustaining administrative and structural reforms, including through assistance to ensure the efficient and effective use of Union funds. Member States have increasingly taken up support under the programme, beyond the initial expectations. The requests for support received by the Commission during the 2017 cycle have, based on their estimated value, significantly exceeded the available annual allocation. During the 2018 cycle, the estimated value of requests received (EUR 152 million) was five times the financial resources available for that year (EUR 30.5 million). In 2018 almost all Member States (24) have submitted request for support. The Commission considers that the financial allocation of the structural reform support programme should be increased in order to cater for the needs, in particular, of non-euro area Member States, which embark on structural reforms aimed at making their economies more resilient to shocks and better preparing them for euro area membership, as well as for the needs stemming from the increased number and cost of requests for support from all Member States in relation to the implementation of structural reforms. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/825 establishing a structural reform support programme to: indicate the contribution of the programme to facilitating the participation in the euro area of Member States whose currency is not the euro; adapt the overall objective of the programme by stressing that enhancing cohesion, competitiveness, productivity, sustainable growth and job creation should also contribute to preparations for participation in the euro area by those Member States whose currency is not the euro and that want to join the single currency; increase the financial envelope allocated to the programme to EUR 222.8 million at current prices. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the increase of the dedicated financial envelope for the structural reform support programme from EUR 142.8 million to EUR 222.8 million (current prices) should be put in place for 2019 and 2020. This increase should be made possible by using EUR 80.million from the flexibility instrument under the current multiannual financial framework (Article 11 of Council Regulation 1311/2013), which allows for supplementing the financing available in the general budget of the Union for the financial years 2018 and 2019 beyond the ceiling of heading 1b (cohesion). This increased budget will be supplemented by inviting Member States to make use of the possibility, under the structural reform support programme Regulation, of transferring part of their resources from the technical assistance component of the European Structural and Investment Funds to the Structural Reform Support Programme, for the purpose of the provision of support for the implementation of reforms, including reforms linked to euro adoption. Based on current estimates of possible needs for support, this supplement would increase the total amount of the budget available for support to EUR 300 million, thus doubling the support capacity by 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit Declaration of 7 May 2009, the Union and the partner countries expressed their political support towards liberalisation of the visa regime in a safe and secure environment and reaffirmed their intention to take gradual steps towards a visa free regime for their citizens in due course. On that basis, the Commission presented on 12 November 2010, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate Agreements with the Republic of Belarus on, respectively, the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas, and readmission of persons residing without authorisation. Negotiations with Belarus were officially opened in Brussels on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an agreement initialled on 17 June 2019. In the meantime, Belarus, the European Union and seven participating Member States (Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Finland and Latvia) signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership on 13 October 2016. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Belarus on the facilitation of the issuance of visas. The purpose of the Agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issuance of visas to citizens of the Union and Belarus for intended stays of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - for all visa applicants, a decision on whether or not to issue a visa must, in principle, be taken within 10 calendar days. This period may be extended to a maximum of 30 calendar days when further examination is required. In urgent cases, it may be reduced to two working days or less; - the amount of fees charged for processing visa applications from citizens of the European Union and Belarus shall be EUR 35. These fees shall apply to all visa applicants. In addition, the following categories of persons shall be exempt from these visa fees: children under 12 years of age, persons with disabilities, close relatives, members of official delegations; - the documents required to justify the purpose of the trip have been simplified for certain categories of applicants (e.g. close relatives, business people, members of official delegations, primary and secondary school pupils, students, persons participating in scientific, cultural and sporting events, journalists, etc.); - simplified conditions are provided for the issue of multiple-entry visas valid from 1 to 5 years to certain categories of persons (e.g. members of governments, parliaments and courts, permanent members of official delegations, spouses and children visiting European Union citizens legally residing in the territory of Belarus, or citizens of the Republic of Belarus legally residing in a Member State, persons participating in official, scientific or cultural exchange programmes or cross-border programmes, international sports events); - citizens of the European Union and citizens of Belarus holding a valid biometric diplomatic passport and holders of a valid EU laissez-passer are exempt from the visa requirement for short stays. However, the final assessment of Belarus’ system of issuance will have to be made by the Commission, in consultation with the Member States, before the conclusion of the Agreement. The importance of the fundamental principles governing the cooperation between the Parties as well as the obligations and responsibilities, including the respect of human rights and democratic principles, stemming from the relevant international instruments to which they are bound, is underlined in a preamble to the Agreement. The Parties may suspend the Agreement in whole or in part for any reason, including grounds for suspension such as breach or abuse of a provision of the Agreement, human rights and democracy considerations."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Jordan relations are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Jordan signed an Association Agreement with the Union on 24 November 1997, which entered into force on 1 May 2002. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan. The Jordanian economy has been particularly affected by the conflict that has been raging in Syria since 2011. This regional unrest has caused a considerable deterioration in external revenues and strained public finances. They have affected tourism and foreign direct investment. Regardless of these conflicts, the supply of natural gas from Egypt has been disrupted for several years. In addition, the Jordanian economy has faced a massive influx of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on public finances, public services and infrastructure. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Union has made available more than EUR 2.1 billion to Jordan under different instruments (including EUR 380 million under the two aforementioned MFA programmes) to help the country preserve economic stability, sustain political and economic reform and address its related humanitarian, development and security needs. In addition, the European Investment Bank has allocated around EUR 486 million in project loans to Jordan. A recent evaluation of the implementation of MFA operations concluded that the first MFA programme was adapted to Jordan's economic challenges and in line with EU priorities. The evaluation also found that the programme had been implemented efficiently and in close coordination with the Jordanian authorities, had contributed to preserving macroeconomic stability and has had a positive social impact. In July 2019, given its still difficult economic situation and prospects, Jordan requested further macro-financial assistance from the Union. In this context, the Commission considers that the continued support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Jordan's international partners, of which the EU remains essential. CONTENT: the European Commission proposes to provide Jordan with additional macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 500 million in three instalments in the form of medium and long-term loans. The EU MFA is an exceptional emergency aid instrument designed to respond to serious balance of payments difficulties in third countries. The objective of the proposed MFA is to help Jordan cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2020-2021, reducing the economy’s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities as well as contributing to the debt sustainability. In addition, EU assistance would encourage Jordan to step up its reform efforts through a Memorandum of Understanding, to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities and shall include a package of measures to promote economic adjustment and the implementation of structural reforms. MFA funds shall be made available in the form of low-interest and long-term loans. Disbursements under the proposed programme shall be strictly conditional on the implementation of specific conditions, to be agreed between the EU and Jordan and set out in a Memorandum of Understanding. These conditions should be in line not only with the priorities of the EU-Jordan Partnership, as confirmed at the Brussels III Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region, held from 12 to 14 March 2019, and at the EU-Jordan Association Council on 17 July 2019, but also with the adjustment programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) distinguish two different types of Commission acts: Article 290 of the TFEU allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""delegated acts"" (Article 290(3)). Article 291 of the TFEU allows Member States to adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding Union acts. Those acts can confer implementing powers on the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing them are needed. Legal acts adopted by the Commission in this way are referred to in the terminology used by the Treaty as ""implementing acts"" (Article 291(4)). As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred upon the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 774/94 need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: t here was no need for consultation of interested parties or for an impact analysis since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) 774/94 with the TFEU is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal consists in aligning Council Regulation (EC) No. 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty. Regulation (EC) No 774/94 confers powers on the Commission allowing it to adopt the necessary implementing measures. It also confers powers on the Commission to adopt adjustments to that Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular by a decision to approve an agreement with one or more third countries. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 774/94, the relevant implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp drop in rail traffic, because of a significant fall in demand. This has had a serious impact on railway undertakings. Those circumstances are beyond the control of railway undertakings that have continuously faced considerable liquidity problems, major losses and in some cases are risking insolvency. In order to counteract the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and support railway undertakings, Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 of the European Parliament and of the Council enabled Member States to authorise infrastructure managers to reduce, waive or defer charges for accessing rail infrastructure. That possibility was granted for a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020 and was further extended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1061 until 31 December 2021. The Commission is no longer empowered to extend further that reference period. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing therefore the reference period of Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 should be extended until 30 June 2022 to ensure continuity in the application of the measures. CONTENT: the Commission proposal aims to extend the reference period until 30 June 2022, and to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts to further extend such period until 31 December 2023. It is also proposed that the delegation of power should end on the same date, that is, 31 December 2023. All other provisions of the current Regulation should remain unchanged. The Commission should continuously analyse the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the rail sector and the Union should be in a position to prolong without undue delay the period of application of the measures provided for by this Regulation if the adverse conditions persist. In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, it should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. More specifically: (i) agricultural prices have fallen sharply as a result of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions; (ii) the EU has become more open to global markets; (iii) the EU has made new commitments at international level, for example on climate change mitigation (through COP 21). On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a regulation defining the objectives of the CAP as well as rules on support for strategic plans to be developed by Member States in the framework of the CAP; a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. The CAP general objectives shall focus on the economic viability, the resilience and income of farms, on an enhanced environmental and climate performance, and on the strengthened socio-economic fabric of rural areas. Moreover, fostering knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas is a cross-cutting objective. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation seeks to maintain the architecture and main features of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 on the common organisation of the market in agricultural products while amending a limited number of provisions in view of the new challenges relating to environmental sustainability and climate change and to citizens' expectations regarding food. The proposal seeks, inter alia: to delete provisions related to sectorial interventions as these interventions of the future CAP will be regulated under the CAP strategic plan Regulation and be part of Member States' strategic plans, to ensure a better coherence of CAP interventions; to amend current rules on geographical indications (GIs) aiming at a simpler GI system, faster registration of geographical indications and more efficient approval of amendments to product specifications. The objective is to make the GI system more understandable for consumers, easier to promote, and to reduce the administrative costs associated with managing the system; to simplify some specific procedures with regard to the rules on GIs for wine to make the approval process more efficient; · to clarify the definition of 'Protected Designation of Origin' for wines to enable producer groups to use new varietals, also needed in response to climate change; · to strengthen the protection of GIs against counterfeiting of GIs on the interned and on goods in transit; · to apply the proposed simplification for wine GIs has to be applied also to agricultural products and foodstuffs; · to include provisions that merely translate into internal legislation commitments taken by the EU and its Member States in the context of recent World Trade Organization Ministerial Decisions, notably on export subsidies; · to delete a number of obsolete provisions, inter alia the system of production regulation and requirements applying to the sugar sector that expired at the end of the 2016/2017 marketing year. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that Regulation. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the powers conferred under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 upon the Commission need to be aligned to Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment is not needed since the proposal to align Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to the Lisbon Treaty is an inter-institutional matter that will concern all Council Regulations. The amendments aiming at simplification are of limited scope and purely technical nature. LEGAL BASE: Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposal identifies the delegated and implementing powers of the Commission in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and establishes the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts. In addition, it makes the following points: Simplification : in the light of the experience gained with the application of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 some of the provisions of that Regulation will be simplified, particularly regarding cross compliance requirements. Definitions :for reasons of legal certainty and clarity the proposal provides definitions of 'arable land', 'permanent crops', 'permanent pasture' and 'grassland'. Declaration : the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States not to require the declaration of all the agricultural areas of their holding for farmers with a total area of the holding lower than 1 hectare. It can be assumed that the proposed possibility for Member States to exempt farmers not applying for area-related payments and declaring less than 1 hectare from the requirement of an area declaration will mainly concern livestock producers without any eligible land to apply for area-related payments. The number of farmers which could be affected is difficult to foresee, but it can be assumed that it will be limited, keeping in mind the continued decoupling of livestock payments and transfer to area related payments. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this measure does not involve any additional Union expenditure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. IMPACT ANALYSIS: no impact analysis was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 87(2)(a) and 88 (2), in conjunction with Article 218 (6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal sets out the text of the new Agreement between the EU and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The main elements of the this Agreement can be summarised as follows: Purpose of the Agreement :like the previous version, the purpose of this Agreement is to ensure, with full respect for the privacy, protection of personal data, and other conditions set out in this Agreement, that: financial payment messages referring to financial transfers and related data stored in the territory of the European Union by providers of international financial payment messaging services, that are jointly designated pursuant to this Agreement, are provided to the U.S. Treasury Department for the exclusive purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing; relevant information obtained through the TFTP is provided to law enforcement, public security, or counter terrorism authorities of Member States, or Europol or Eurojust, for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing. Data concerned : the Agreement applies to the obtaining and use of financial payment messaging and related data with a view to the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of acts of a person or entity that involve violence, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or create a risk of damage to property or infrastructure, and which, given their nature and context, are reasonably believed to be committed with the aim of: intimidating or coercing a population; intimidating, compelling, or coercing a government or international organisation to act or abstain from acting; seriously destabilizing or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic, or social structures of a country or an international organisation. It may also concern data from a person or entity assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services to or in support of, abovementioned acts. Since the new systems architecture of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication –SWIFT- (hereinafter referred to as the ""designated provider"") became operational on 1 January 2010, a significant volume of the data which were previously received by the U.S. Treasury Department under the TFTP, have not been available, undermining the benefits of the TFTP not least for the European Union. Ensuring Provision of Data by Designated Providers : the Agreement stipulates that the Parties, jointly and individually, shall ensure that entities jointly designated by the Parties under this Agreement as providers of international financial payment messaging services (""Designated Providers"", i.a. Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication - SWIFT-) provide to the U.S. Treasury Department requested financial payment messaging and related data which are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing (""Provided Data""). U.S. Requests to Obtain Data from Designated Providers : for the purposes of this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall serve production orders (“Requests”), under authority of U.S. law, upon a Designated Provider present in the territory of the United States in order to obtain data necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing that are stored in the territory of the European Union. The Request (together with any supplemental documents) shall: identify as clearly as possible the data, including the specific categories of data requested, that are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing; clearly substantiate the necessity of the data; be tailored as narrowly as possible in order to minimize the amount of data requested, taking due account of past and current terrorism risk analyses focused on message types and geography as well as perceived terrorism threats and vulnerabilities, geographic, threat, and vulnerability analyses; not seek any data relating to the Single Euro Payments Area. A copy of the Request shall be sent to Europol. O nce Europol has confirmed that the Request complies with the requirements of the Agreement, the Request shall have binding legal effect as provided under U.S. law, within the European Union as well as the United States. The Designated Provider is thereby authorised and required to provide the data to the U.S. Treasury Department. Safeguards Applicable to the Processing of Provided Data : the U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure that Provided Data are processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement The TFTP shall avoiddata mining or any other type of algorithmic or automated profiling or computer filtering. The U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure that Provided Data are processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure the protection of personal data by means of a series of safeguards set out in the Agreement. Provisions on data security and integrity are also laid down in the Agreement. Necessary and Proportionate Processing of Data : all searches of Provided Data shall be based upon pre-existing information or evidence which demonstrates a reason to believe that the subject of the search has a nexus to terrorism or its financing. Provided Data may include identifying information about the originator and/or recipient of a transaction, including name, account number, address, and national identification number. The Parties recognize the special sensitivity of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious or other beliefs, trade union membership, or health and sexual life (“sensitive data”). In the exceptional circumstance that extracted data were to include sensitive data, the U.S. Treasury Department shall protect such data in accordance with the safeguards and security measures set forth in this Agreement and with full respect and taking due account of their special sensitivity. Retention and Deletion of Data : during the term of this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall undertake an ongoing and at least annual evaluation to assess the data retention periods to ensure that they continue to be no longer than necessary to combat terrorism or its financing. Where such data are identified, the U.S. Treasury Department shall permanently delete them as soon as technologically feasible. If it transpires that financial payment messaging data were transmitted which were not requested, the U.S. Treasury Department shall promptly and permanently delete such data and shall inform the relevant Designated Provider. All non-extracted data received prior to 20 July 2007 shall be deleted not later than 20 July 2012. All non-extracted data received on or after 20 July 2007 shall be deleted not later than five years from receipt. Not later than three years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department shall prepare a joint report regarding the value of TFTP Provided Data, with particular emphasis on the value of data retained for multiple years and relevant information obtained from the joint review conducted pursuant to the Agreement. Onward Transfer : provisions are laid down as regards the onward transfer of information extracted from the Provided Data. Such information shall be shared for lead purposes only and for the exclusive purpose of the investigation, detection, prevention, or prosecution of terrorism or its financing.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union is a Party to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution following its approval in 1981. The Convention is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to limit and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution and its adverse effects upon human health and the environment in the UNECE region. To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants which aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Parties present at the 31st session of the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted by consensus Decisions 2012/5 and 2012/6 amending the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals. Decision 2012/6 entered into force and has become effective. However, Decision 2012/5 requires ratification by the Parties to the Protocol. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendment to the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals. This Protocol aims to reduce and control anthropogenic emissions into the air of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), as harmful heavy metals subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport, with a view to further protecting human health and the environment. In this respect, it requires Parties to reduce their total annual emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995). The amended Protocol sets out, in particular, stricter emission limit values for dust emissions from certain major stationary sources as well as flexible transitional arrangements that shall benefit those Parties that will accede the Protocol, as amended, between 1st January 2014 and 31 December 2019. The amendment to the Protocol is largely covered by current EU law notably via existing emission source control legislation, including above-mentioned Directive 2010/75/EU and the Commission Implementing Decisions adopted in accordance with this Directive and which establish the applicable BAT conclusions for various industrial sectors, such as the manufacture of glass and the production of iron and steel, cement, lime and magnesium oxide and chlor-alkali. This amendment shall be further transposed in particular via a new Directive setting updated national emission ceilings for certain atmopsheric pollutants and providing for annual national emission inventories that shall cover, among others, emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Liberia with a view to concluding a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and an Implementation Protocol thereto between the European Union and Liberia. Following these negotiations, a new Agreement and Protocol were initialled on 5 June 2015. It is now appropriate to conclude that Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the draft decision calls on the Council to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Liberia and the Implementation Protocol. Objectives: the new Agreement will provide for a framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and Liberia. The main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Liberian fishing zone, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and respecting the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), where applicable within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Liberia to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Liberia’s fishing zone, in the interests of both parties. Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution has been set at: (a) a reference tonnage of 6 500 tonnes, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR 357 500 for the first year, EUR 325 000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR 292 500 for the fifth year; and (b) support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Republic of Liberia, amounting to EUR 357 500 for the first year, EUR 325 000 for the second, third and fourth years, and EUR 292 500 for the fifth year. This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the Republic of Liberia’s needs in relation to scientific research, artisanal fisheries as well as fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance and the fight against illegal fishing. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: The allocation of fishing opportunities will be set out between the EU Member States. Duration of the agreement: the Protocol covers a period of five years from the date of provisional application– i.e. from the date of its signature."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components for L-category vehicles and a sizeable drop in demand for those vehicles. This has led to important delays for manufacturers to clear their stock of Euro 4 vehicles that, according to Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, need to be registered before the application of the environmental Euro 5 step on 1 January 2021. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, motorcycles sales have been highly impacted. Because of Member States authorities’ lockdowns, sales could not take place during the peak season. According to industry sources, it is estimated that around 553 700 Euro 4 vehicles were in stock in March 2020. During the lockdowns, sales went down by 98% and remained sluggish since then. It is therefore likely that not all Euro 4 vehicles currently in stock will be sold by the end of the year. The end-of-series provisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 allow manufacturers to continue to make available on the market, register or enter into service a limited part of a stock of L-category vehicles which cannot be made available on the market or can no longer be made available on the market, owing to the entry into force of new technical requirements against which those vehicles have not been approved. Considering the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is apparent that the provisions on end-of-series do not constitute an appropriate mechanism to address the amount of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that manufacturers will have in stock following the application of the environmental Euro 5 step. CONTENT: in the context of the current COVID-19 epidemic, the main purpose of the proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 is to adapt the provisions relating to the number of end-of-series vehicles in order to allow dealers to sell higher amounts of their stock of Euro 4 vehicles in 2021 only. In order to ensure that the application of these measures is restricted to vehicles that were in stock at the moment of the national lockdowns, the amount of vehicles benefiting from these specific end-of-series measures shall not exceed the number of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that were in stock on 15 March 2020. This proposal: - shall not increase pollutant emissions as the flexibility shall be limited to already produced vehicles at the time of the lockdown; - avoid the need to unnecessarily scrap vehicles that would have been otherwise placed on the market in absence of the crisis; - shall not postpone the entry into force of the Euro 5 step for all newly produced vehicles on 1 January 2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. CONTENT: the European Union concluded the deal with Latin American countries (Geneva Convention) and the US in December 2009 which settles 15 years of banana disputes. It also cuts the tariff which the EU applies to bananas imported from Latin American countries. With those two agreements, years of lengthy and complex negotiations where put to an end. With the Geneva Agreement entering into force, it is necessary to abolish the existing applied EU Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff rate for the importation of bananas by repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas which established the currently applied rate of EUR 176/tonne. In accordance with the Geneva Agreement, the Union will gradually reduce its banana tariff from EUR 176/tonne to EUR 114/tonne. A first cut, which was applied retroactively as of 15 December 2009, the date of initialling of the Agreement, reduced the tariff to EUR 148/tonne. The subsequent cuts are to apply in seven annual instalments with a possible delay of a maximum of two years if agreement on agriculture modalities in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is delayed. The final tariff of EUR 114/tonne is to be reached on 1 January 2019 at the latest. The tariff reductions will be bound in the WTO at the moment of the certification of the EU banana schedule. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the Agreements reduce progressively the tariff rates for bananas. It can be estimated that these measures will lead to smaller own resources as follows: -EUR 3.5 million in 2009, -EUR 74.8million in 2010, - EUR 88.1 million in 2011, and -EUR 106.8 million in 2012. These are net amounts after deduction of collecting costs by Member States. An estimate of own resources for 2009 was included because of the retroactive validity of these Agreements to 15/12/2009."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is to ensure an exploitation of living biological resources that is sustainable economically, environmentally and socially. The Union has been a contracting party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) since 14 November 1997. ICCAT has the authority to adopt recommendations on the conservation and management of the fisheries under its competence, which are binding on the contracting parties. As part of the measures to regulate bluefin tuna stocks and to improve the quality and reliability of statistical data, and in order to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing, ICCAT adopted a recommendation introducing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme (BCD) and a recommendation developing the implementation of the bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme by introducing a mandatory electronic document system (eBCD). The purpose of this proposal is to transpose and implement existing ICCAT measures, which are binding upon the contracting parties. CONTENT: this proposal establishes a Union bluefin tuna catch documentation programme to implement the conservation and management measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas relating to bluefin tuna catch documentation programme and the mandatory use of the electronic bluefin tuna catch documentation system with a view to identifying the origin of all bluefin tuna. Specifically, the proposal: - lays down general provisions on the use of bluefin catch and re-export certificates and sets rules for the recording and validation of catch and subsequent trade events of bluefin tuna. Particular rules are set for tagged fish; - introduces additional provisions on verification before validation, transmission of data from eBCD users, the use of paper eBCD in exceptional cases and annual reporting to ICCAT; - sets out a detailed list of cases where delegated powers are requested to address frequent changes to the recommendations adopted by ICCAT."
9258EP8,"""""Common rules ensuring basic air connectivity with regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the Union""""",0.629,0.796,0.84,1.25,0.231,0.776,0.796,0.731,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to avoid a total interruption of air traffic between the EU and the United Kingdom in the absence of an agreement to withdraw the United Kingdom from the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the conditions for the granting of the Union operating licence to air carriers and establishes the freedom to provide intra-EU air services. In the absence of any provisions to the contrary in a withdrawal agreement, air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulation upon withdrawal. Moreover, certain air carriers, by reason of their holding an operating licence issued by the United Kingdom, or their principal place of business being located in the United Kingdom, or their being majority owned or effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or its nationals, would cease to meet the conditions laid down in the said Regulation to qualify as Union carriers. The carriers in any of the situations described above would lose their Union operating licence and, as a consequence, no longer enjoy the right to provide intra-Union air services. Direct air transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States are almost entirely in the hands of United Kingdom and Union air carriers. The loss by those air carriers of their right to provide air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would therefore result in serious disruption. Most, if not all, air routes between the Union and the United Kingdom would cease to be served. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The Commission considers it necessary to establish a temporary set of measures enabling carriers licensed in the United Kingdom to provide air transport services between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down provisional measures to govern air transport between the Union and the United Kingdom following the latter's withdrawal from the Union. This proposal complements Union Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. Although the approach followed in the Union's air transport agreements with third countries has been respected in some areas (e.g. operating authorisations), the specific purpose and context of this Regulation, as well as its unilateral nature, necessarily require a more restrictive approach in the grant of rights, as well as specific provisions intended to preserve equality of rights and a level playing field. Maintain basic connectivity The proposed Regulation provides for the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories. No distinction is made between passenger and cargo operations, or scheduled and non-scheduled services. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a short transition period ending 30 March, 2020. Reciprocity and fair competition The measures would enter into force subject to the United Kingdom granting equivalent rights to EU air carriers and ensuring fair competition. Otherwise, the Commission would be empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts, including the limitation or withdrawal of operating authorisations of United Kingdom air carriers. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high standards in the area of air transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) non-discrimination of EU carriers in the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: tourism plays a central role in Europe’s economy today. The travel market has evolved since the adoption of Directive 90/314/EEC. The Internet has become an increasingly important medium to offer travel services. Travel services are not only combined in the form of traditional pre-arranged packages, but are often combined in a customised fashion. Many of these travel products are either in a legal grey zone or are clearly not covered by Directive 90/314/EEC. It is therefore necessary to adapt the legislative framework to market developments, remove ambiguities and close legislative gaps. The modernisation of Directive 90/314/EEC responds to requests from the co-legislators and a large part of the industry and consumer organisations. A revision of the Directive is explicitly mentioned in the European Citizens' Report, the European Consumer Agenda and in the Single Market Act II. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment (IA) analysed eight policy options plus certain sub-options, including maintaining the status quo, the drawing up of guidelines, the introduction of a package travel “label”, self-regulation by the industry, various options to modernise the Directive, as well as the adoption of a “Travel Directive”. The chosen option is that of a graduated approach involving the modernisation of the Directive and the coverage of both one trader and multi-trader packages, while applying a lighter regime to “multi-trader” assisted travel arrangements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive seeks to clarify and modernise the scope of travellers' protection when purchasing combinations of travel services for the same trip or holiday by bringing within its scope different forms of on-line packages and assisted travel arrangements. The proposal will ensure that travellers are better informed about the services they are buying and grant them clearer remedies if something goes wrong. Package travel: the proposal: · lists specific pre-contractual information which organisers and, where applicable, retailers have to provide to travellers wishing to buy a package; · contains provisions on the content and the presentation of the contract or its confirmation, as well as on documents and information to be provided before the start of the package; · regulates the possibility and the consequence of price changes; · contains additional termination rights for travellers before the start of the package and grants travellers the right to terminate the contract without compensation in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances; · regulates the organiser's liability for the performance of the package and the obligation to provide assistance to the traveller; only the organiser is liable for the performance of the package; retailers involved in the booking of packages and assisted travel arrangements are liable for booking errors; · provides for the remedies available to the traveller in the event of the lack of performance and the improper performance of the services; · lays down the obligations to remedy the lack of conformity and to make suitable alternative arrangements for the continuation of the package where a significant proportion of the services cannot be provided as agreed in the contract. Where it is impossible to ensure the traveller's timely return because of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, the organiser's obligation to bear the cost for the continued stay is limited to EUR 100 per night and three nights per traveller; · provides that only package organisers and retailers who facilitate the purchase of 'assisted travel arrangements' are subject to theobligation to provide insolvency protection; · provides that travellers may address messages, complaints or claims also to the retailer. Assisted travel arrangement: these are defined as a combination of at least two different types of travel services for the purpose of the same trip or holiday, not constituting a package, resulting in the conclusion of separate contracts with the individual travel service providers. Retailers offering assisted travel arrangements would have to explain to travellers in a clear and prominent manner that only the relevant service providers are liable for performance of the services and that travellers will not benefit from any of the Union rights granted to package travellers, except the right to a refund of pre-payments and, where relevant, to repatriation in case the retailer itself or any of the service providers becomes insolvent. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only operational costs relate to the preparation of the report on the application of this Directive, covering the preparatory work of an external contractor, i.e. operational appropriation of EUR 0.2 million under the Rights and Citizenship programme, as well as administrative expenditure of around EUR 0.184 million during seven years after the adoption of the Directive."
564EP8,"""""Landing obligation""""",0.943,0.928,0.2,0.167,0.115,0.925,0.942,0.692,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation envisaged under the Common Fisheries Policy reform (CFP). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the central objective of the future Regulation seeking to amend the Common Fisheries Policy is to progressively eliminate discards in all EU fisheries through the introduction of a landing obligation for catches of species subject to catch limits and species covered by minimum sizes in the Mediterranean. The European Parliament in its plenary vote in February 2013 agreed the gradual introduction of the landing obligation with a starting date of 2014 for pelagic fisheries, highly migratory species and salmon in the Baltic and extending to all fisheries in the Union in the following years. Subsequently, political agreement has been reached by the European Parliament and Council on the Basic Regulation with a new start date for implementation of the landing obligation of 1 January 2015. In the framework of the reform, it is the intention of the Commission that a new technical measures framework will be developed as part of the reform which, over time, should facilitate the full implementation of the landing obligation as envisaged. However, this new framework will almost certainly not be in place in time for the first group of fisheries to be covered under the landing obligation. Therefore legislation is required to remove any legal and practical impediments to implementation on a transitional basis while this new framework is being developed. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no specific Impact Assessment has been carried out as the impacts of introducing a landing obligation have already been assessed under the impact assessment supporting the reform of the CFP. High levels of discards are identified as an important driver of the lack of environmental sustainability of the CFP in the impact assessment. CONTENT: the main action of the proposed Regulation is to facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation envisaged under the Common Fisheries Policy reform by removing all existing provisions from EU technical measures and control regulations that run contrary to the landing obligation. On the technical measures regulations several provisions contained in the current regulations contradict the landing obligation and oblige fishermen to discard. These are minimum landing sizes (MLS), catch composition rules and bycatch provisions. In particular, in order to ensure the implementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms should be amended by: requiring all unintended catches of marine organisms subject to the landing obligation caught in excess of catch composition rules should be landed and counted against quotas; replacing minimum landing sizes for marine organisms subject to the landing obligation with minimum conservation reference sizes; requiring all unintended catches of marine organisms caught in excess of bycatch provisions in specific areas, at specific times and for specified gear types to be landed and counted against quotas. In addition, in order to ensure legal certainty, provisions relating to an area closure for the protection of juvenile haddock in ICES division VIb should be amended. With the same purpose, the Commission seeks to amend: Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound; Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea; Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks; Council Regulation (EC) No 254/2002 establishing measures to be applicable in 2002 for the recovery of the stocks of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES division VIIa): Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks. Council Regulation (EC) 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy also needs to be aligned with the landing obligation. The modifications required concern changes to: fishing authorisations; recording of data on all catches particularly when below minimum conservation reference sizes; a higher margin of tolerance for catch estimates below 50 kg in logbooks and transhipment declarations; establishment of rules for remote electronic monitoring (REM) for the recording of data for monitoring the landing obligation at sea; separate stowage of catches and control of marketing of catches below minimum conservation reference sizes; establishing the conditions for the use of control observers for monitoring purposes; the definition of the violation of the landing obligation as a serious infringement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he proposal repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial movements of pet animals into a Member State from another Member State or from third countries and the checks applicable to such movements.

In a statement annexed to Regulation (EU) No 438/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, the Commission undertook to propose a revision of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 in its entirety, and, in particular, the aspects of delegated and implementing acts. Therefore, due to the entry into force of the Treaty, the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 need to be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 of that Treaty. (2) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 also provides that as of 3 July 2011, i.e. the end of the eight-year transitional period provided for in Article 4(1) thereof, electronic identification is the only means of identifying a pet dog, cat or ferret. However, an animal bearing a clearly readable tattoo applied before that date continues to be considered identified in accordance with the Regulation. Because of the expiry of the aforementioned transitional regime and period and the need to make a number of amendments bringing the animal health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 into line with the TFEU in a sufficiently clear and accessible manner for the ordinary citizen, that Regulation should be repealed and replaced by this proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2) and the introductory phrase and point (b) of Article 168(4) of the Treaty of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of the proposal is to repeal and replace Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 by the proposed Regulation, which: aligns the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU; clarifies for the ordinary citizen the regime that will apply after the end of the transitional regime provided for in Articles 6, 8 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 and of the transitional period provided for in Article 4(1). This proposal and the proposal amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC which relates to trade in and imports of dogs, cats and ferrets should be presented together in order to be adopted simultaneously. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the Union budget."
936EP7,"""""European Banking Authority""""",0.632,0.89,0.86,0.29,0.273,0.892,0.851,0.029,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish a European Banking Authority. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: experience of the financial crisis has exposed important failures in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Building on the recommendations presented in February 2009 of a group of high level experts, chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière, the Commission set out proposals for a new European financial supervisory architecture in its Communication to the Spring European Council of March 2009 (COM(2009)0114). The Commission presented its ideas in more detail in its Communication of May 2009 (COM(2009)0252) which proposed the establishment of : a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), created by transforming the existing European supervisory committees into a European Banking Authority (EBA), a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), thereby combining the advantages of an overarching European framework for financial supervision with the expertise of local micro-prudential supervisory bodies that are closest to the institutions operating in their jurisdictions; and a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), to monitor potential threats to financial stability that arise from macro-economic developments and from developments within the financial system as a whole. To this end, the ESRB would provide an early warning of system-wide risks that may be building up and, where necessary, issue recommendations for action to deal with these risks. The European Council, in its conclusions of 19 June 2009, recommended that a European System of Financial Supervisors, comprising three new European Supervisory Authorities, be established. The system should be aimed at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision, strengthening oversight of cross border groups and establishing a European single rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. It should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to proposals on: · a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), · a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), · a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the May Commission Communication on Financial Supervision in Europe was accompanied by an impact assessment analysing the main policy options for establishing the ESFS and ESRB. A second impact assessment accompanies these proposals, examining the options in more detail (see SEC(2009)1234.) CONTENT: in order to take account of sectoral specificities, three separate Regulations are needed to establish the Authorities for banking, insurance and occupational pensions, and securities. The broad thrust of these proposals is, however, identical. The proposal discusses the common elements and briefly touches upon the differences between the three Regulations. Objectives of the ESAs : these shall be to contribute to: (i) improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular a high, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision, (ii) protecting depositors, investors, policyholders and other beneficiaries, (iii) ensuring the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, (iv) safeguarding the stability of the financial system, and (v) strengthening international supervisory coordination. The ESAs will be Community bodies with a legal personality and a key element of the proposed ESFS. The latter shall function as a network of supervisors and comprise the national authorities in the Member States, a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities, to cover cross-sectoral issues, and the European Commission. While the ESAs should enjoy maximum independence to objectively fulfil their mission, the Commission has to be involved where institutional reasons and the responsibilities under the Treaty so require. The main decision-making body of each ESA will be its Board of Supervisors, consisting of the heads of the relevant national supervisors as well as the Chairperson of the respective Authority. The Chairperson will preside over meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Management Board. The day-to-day management of each Authority will be in the hands of an Executive Director. Tasks and powers : the ESAs will take on all the tasks of the existing European supervisory committees, but also have significantly increased responsibilities, defined legal powers and greater authority. Develop technical standards : a single EU rule book should be established, applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. To this end, differences in the national transposition of Community law stemming from exceptions, derogations, additions or ambiguities must be removed, so that one harmonised core set of standards can be defined and applied. To contribute to this, the Authorities will develop draft technical standards. These standards constitute an effective instrument to strengthen Level 3 of the Lamfalussy structure, which currently is limited to the adoption of non-binding guidelines. Powers to ensure the consistent application of Community rules : a mechanism will be put in place to address behaviour by national supervisory authorities who are considered to be diverging from the existing Community legislation (including technical standards). The proposal describes the steps of the mechanism. Action in emergency situations : whilst ESAs will have a coordination role between national supervisory authorities, in some emergency situations coordination may not be sufficient, notably when national supervisors alone lack the tools to respond rapidly to an emerging cross-border crisis. The ESAs should thereforehave the power to require national supervisors to take specific action jointly. The determination of a cross-border emergency situation will be left to the Commission. This is subject to the safeguard clause. Settlement of disagreements between national supervisory authorities : a mechanism is proposed to ensure that relevant national supervisory authorities take due account of the interests of other Member States, including within colleges of supervisors. This mechanism consists of three possible steps which are set out in the text. Colleges of supervisors : the latter are central to the EU supervisory system and play an important role in ensuring a balanced flow of information between home and host authorities. The ESAs will contribute to promoting the efficient and consistent functioning of colleges of supervisors and may participate as observers in colleges of supervisors and receive all relevant information shared between the members of the college. Common supervisory culture: the ESAs shall play an active role in building a common European supervisory culture and ensuring uniform procedures and consistent supervisory practices throughout the Community. The common supervisory culture may increasingly create opportunities for supervisors to delegate certain tasks to one another. The ESAs shall periodically conduct peer review analysis of national supervisory authorities. Assessment of market developments : although the proposed ESRB will be responsible for macro-prudential analysis of the EU financial sector, the ESAs should continue the work of the existing European supervisory committees in this area as: (i) the focus of their analysis is different, i.e., micro-prudential analysis provides a bottom-up analysis, rather than macro-prudential analysis which is top-down, and (ii) their analysis may serve as helpful input into the work carried-out by the ESRB. International role : through these proposals the Commission is responding to the weaknesses identified during the crisis as well as to the G20 call to take action to build a stronger, more globally consistent, regulatory and supervisory system for financial services. The ESAs could serve as helpful contact points for supervisory authorities from third countries. They may enter into administrative arrangements with administrations of third countries and may also assist in preparing equivalence decisions pertaining to supervisory regimes in third countries. They may provide advice to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission or publish opinions, including with respect to the prudential assessments of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Collection of information : at the request of the Authority, supervisory authorities and other public authorities of the Member States shall provide the Authority with all the necessary information to carry out the duties assigned to it by this Regulation. In principle, all information should be transferred to the ESAs by the national supervisory authorities. Relationship with the ESRB: the framework for EU supervision can only work if the ESRB and ESFS cooperate closely. In fulfilling its role as macro-prudential supervisor, the ESRB would need a timely flow of micro-prudential information, while micro-prudential supervision by national authorities would benefit from the ESRB’s insights on the macro-prudential environment. The Regulations also specify the procedures to be followed by the ESAs to act upon recommendations by the ESRB and how the ESAs should use their powers to ensure timely follow-up to recommendations addressed to one or more national supervisory authorities. Safeguard: in view of the fact that decisions by the ESAs should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States, a safeguard clause is introduced which ensures that, where a Member State considers that a decision taken under provisions concerning emergency decisions or settlement of disagreements of these Regulations impinges on its fiscal responsibility, it may notify the Authority and the Commission that the national supervisory authority does not intend to implement the Authority's decision, clearly demonstrating how the decision by the Authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities. Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities : a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities will ensure mutual understanding, cooperation and consistent supervisory approaches between the three new ESAs. Board of Appeal : an appeal system will ensure that any person, including national supervisory authorities, may in first instance appeal to a Board of Appeal against a decision by the ESAs to ensure the coherent application of Community rules, action in emergency situations, and the settlement of disagreements. The Board of Appeal shall be a joint body of three ESAs, i.e., it will deal with issues related to banking, insurance and securities. Key differences between the three Regulations : the main differences between the three proposed Regulations concern the objectives of the Authorities, the scope of action, and the definitions, which are adapted to the specificities of the relevant sector and existing Community legislation. Moreover, the European Council concluded that the ESAs should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies. ESMA would be responsible to register credit rating agencies. ESMA would also be empowered to take supervisory measures such as withdrawing the registration or suspending the use for regulatory purposes of credit ratings. Supervisory powers could include the power to request information and to conduct investigations or on-site inspections. The responsibilities and powers of ESMA with regard to credit rating agencies will be defined in an amendment to the Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: for the transformation of the existing European supervisory committees into effective ESAs, enhanced resources are needed - both personnel and budgetary. For the EBA, the total operational expenditure from the Community budget in commitment and payment appropriations for the years 2011-2013 is EUR 21.527 million. In addition, Member States (national supervisory authorities or ministries of finance) will contribute EUR 32.290 million over the three year period. This gives a total of EUR 53.816 million from 2011 to 2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBF) throughout its distribution. The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin tuna entered into force on 20 May 1994. The European Union has been a Cooperating Non-Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission since 2006. Cooperating Non-Members participate fully in the activities of the CCSBT but are not entitled to vote. On 1 December 2009, the Council authorised the European Commission to seek, on behalf of the European Union, an amendment to the rules of Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in order for the European Union to become a Contracting Party. During its 20th meeting in October 2013, the CCSBT amended the Resolution governing the Extended Commission to allow the European Union to become a Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission through Exchange of Letters. Since vessels flying the flags of Member States of the Union fish resources in the area of distribution of Southern Bluefin Tuna, it is in the Union's interest to play an effective role in the implementation of the Convention. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to conclude the legal process launched with the signature and provisional application of the Exchange of Letters to obtain membership of the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended Scientific Committee after having obtained the consent from the European Parliament.

2015EP7,"""""Investor-compensation schemes""""",0.053,0.886,0.895,0.452,0.364,0.952,0.846,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to extend the scope of compensation under the Investor-Compensation Schemes (ICSD) and amending Directive 97/9/EC. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 97/9/EC on Investor-Compensation Schemes (ICSD) provides for clients receiving investment services from investment firms to be compensated in specific circumstances where the firm is unable to return money or financial instruments that it holds on the client's behalf. In recent years, the Commission has received numerous investor complaints about the application of the ICSD in a number of important cases involving large investor losses. The complaints relate to the coverage and funding of schemes and delays in obtaining compensation. The main problem with the application of the Directive is the large margin for discretion it grants to Member States. Moreover, there are issues such as the current non-compensation of investors who, due to the default of a depositary or third party, cannot recover their assets or suffer a loss in the value of their units or shares in a UCITS. These need to be addressed at EU level, since other solutions could fragment the protection of investors in the EU markets. An additional element relates to the fact that through the amendment of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (Directive 94/19/EC), the level of protection for bank depositors was increased. Moreover, the functioning of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DSG) is being modified (see COD/2010/0207). Investment firms should not be undermined due to the increase of protection in the bank deposits sector. Therefore it is necessary to assess the level of protection of investors at EU level, to take into account any regulatory change that might have consequences in the field of investments. This initiative is part of a broader package on compensation and guarantee schemes that will comprise two proposals for amendment of the Directives on Investor Compensation Schemes and on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and a White Paper on the insurance schemes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Policy options were mainly related to the funding of the schemes, the payout delays, the coverage of the compensation and the level of compensation. Each policy option was assessed against the following criteria: investor protection and confidence, level playing field in the protection provided for different types of investments or services in the EU and cost-effectiveness that is the extent to which the option achieves the sought objectives and facilitates the operation of securities markets in a cost effective and efficient way. LEGAL BASE: Article 53(1) of the TFEU. CONTENT: the proposal aims at improving the practical functioning of the ICSD, at clarifying the scope of the ICSD taking into account the financial crisis and recent changes in the EU regulatory landscape, at reducing gaps in the regulatory system and disparities between the protection of clients of investment firms and of banking depositors. In the light of the existing differences in the functioning of the schemes at national level, the proposal introduces common rules to ensure a degree of harmonisation in the funding of the schemes and in the day-to-day practice. It also introduces a provision of a borrowing mechanism among national schemes as a last resort tool to compensate any temporary needs from schemes, subject to a rigorous assessment carried out by the European Securities and Markets Authority and to the obligation to repay any loan within the maximum period of five years. The main points are as follows: Alignment with MiFID - services covered and classification of clients : the scope of the ICSD is currently cross-referenced to investment services as defined under the Investment Services Directive (Council Directive 93/22/EEC). The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC on MiFID) has repealed the ISD and broadened the scope of services covered under the sectoral legislation (e.g the operation of Multilateral Trading Facilities is included in the scope of MiFID). A number of technical issues have also arisen, such as the coverage of firms depending on the scope of their authorisation (i.e. whether the firm is authorised to hold client assets or not). The proposed amendment clarifies that all investment services and activities covered under MiFID should be subject to the ICSD and that if firms hold client assets (irrespective of restrictions on their authorisation or the nature of their investment service) then clients should be entitled to compensation under the ICSD. Another amendment deriving from MiFID provisions concerns the classification of clients. National legislation in Member States may provide that professional and institutional investors can be excluded from coverage under the ICSD. However, since the ICSD pre-dates the MiFID, the list of professional and institutional investors under the ICSD does not coincide with the corresponding list under MiFID. The proposal aligns the classification of clients in the ICSD with the MiFID definition of clients considered as professional. This will ensure consistency between the two Directives, and result in better protection for medium-sized enterprises which may currently be excluded from the protection granted by the ICSD and are instead normally classified as retail clients under the MiFID. Failure of a third party custodian: the ICSD protects investors when a firm is unable to return financial instruments or money held on a client's behalf in connection with investment services. Under MiFID, financial instruments can be held in two different ways: (i) by the investment firm itself holding financial instruments for a client, or (ii) by a custodian usually selected by the firm. Investors may not only be exposed to the failure of the firm, but also to the potential failure of a custodian. In a case where a third party custodian is not able to return the financial instruments to its client, the client will not be able to benefit from any payment by the compensation scheme established under the ICSD. As a result, there is a difference in the level of protection provided for investors who have purchased a financial instrument, depending on whether the firm itself or a third party custodian holds their assets. The proposal extends compensation to investors for claims relating to the failure of a firm to return financial instruments due to the failure of a third party custodian. Failure of a UCITS depositary : the management of Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is not a MiFID investment service. As a result the ICSD does not cover UCITS and their units' holders in cases where losses are suffered due to the failure of a UCITS depositary or sub-custodian. This situation however is comparable, in substance, to the one described above where losses are suffered due to the failure of an investment firm custodian or sub-custodian. As a consequence, the proposed measure will give UCITS holders the right to be compensated by the investor-compensation scheme if the assets cannot be returned to the UCITS, because of the failure of a UCITS depositary or sub-custodian. The cost of this extension in coverage should be borne by these entities rather than investment firms. Exclusion of claims involving market abuse: the ICSD excludes claims where a criminal conviction has been obtained for money laundering but not claims by investors who have engaged in market abuse. The proposal modifies the relevant provisions so that the ICSD will explicitly exclude any claim for compensation where the investor has engaged in actions that are prohibited under Directive 2003/6/EC on insider dealing and market manipulation. The investors who have committed these acts should be excluded from compensation. Level of compensation : the ICSD harmonises the minimum level of compensation (EUR 20 000) for each investor, and this was aligned with the one set under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (EUR 20 000 at the time). But the compensation limit of EUR 20 000 was never adjusted to reflect inflation or the increased exposure of European investors to financial instruments since the ICSD entered into force. Furthermore, the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) was recently amended to provide for at least EUR 50 000 per depositor per credit institution, to be increased to a fixed level of EUR 100 000. The Commission proposes to increase the level of compensation to a fixed amount of EUR 50 000. As some Member States have currently a higher level of compensation, a grandfathering clause of three years will allow them to adapt to the EUR 50 000 coverage level. In the case of credit institutions doubts may arise as to the coverage under the ICSD rather than the DGSD of monies deposited in a bank in the context of the provision of investment services. To deal with situations of possible uncertainty due to the specific nature of banks which may provide both banking activity and investment services, the ICSD is being amended to specify that in cases of doubt the investor is to be compensated under the DGSD (which provided a higher level of coverage). Funding principles : the broad discretion under the ICSD about how to fund schemes (e.g. ex ante or ex post, in respect of the occurrence of any loss events) and huge differences in the way funding is organised by individual Member States create a number of problems. A new article is introduced specifying the basic principles about the funding of the investor-compensation schemes. In particular: in principle, the cost of financing schemes should continue to be borne by market participants; the schemes should be adequately financed in proportion to their potential liabilities; in order to provide a sufficient level of funding, a minimum target fund level will be established for all the schemes. This target fund level will be fully ex ante funded. Taking into account the current differences at national level, the target fund level should initially be reached within a 10-year period; when, in concrete cases, the ex ante funds are not sufficient to cover the liabilities of a scheme, additional calls for contributions from entities covered under the scheme should be ensured. However, they should not jeopardise the stability of the financial system of the Member State ; once these funding sources have been exhausted, the scheme may have recourse to borrowing from other compensation schemes; access to further multiple funding sources has to be ensured, including borrowing facilities; schemes should publish details about their level of funding. Borrowing last resort mechanism between national schemes : together with the establishment of consistent funding rules between Member States, the introduction of cooperation arrangements among national schemes will provide greater protection to investors and promote investor confidence in investment services. The system is based on the principle of solidarity between the national schemes. A borrowing mechanism among schemes is introduced as a last resort tool. These measures should provide schemes with an alternative back up source of funding, under specific conditions and on a temporary basis. Detailed funding principles and a repayment (mid-term) obligation upon the borrowing scheme will limit the risk of moral hazard between undersized and better funded schemes. Under the proposal: schemes should have the right to borrow from the other schemes if their funds are insufficient to cover their immediate needs; a portion of ex-ante funding in each compensation scheme will have to be available for lending to other schemes; ESMA should receive any borrowing request, assess whether the relevant requirements are met and, if this is the case, transmit it to the other schemes; loans should be repaid to the lending schemes at the latest after 5 years since the request. Interests should accrue on the loans; the interest rate shall be equivalent to the marginal lending facility rate of the ECB; the borrowing mechanism should be limited to the claims covered under the Directive. For instance, schemes will not be able to borrow for any needs arising from the default of entities not included in the scope of the directive; a limit of 20% of the portion set aside for lending may be used for each case. Compensation limit (""co-insurance principle""): the ICSD allows Member states to limit the coverage of the compensation to a specified percentage (equal to or exceeding 90%) of an investor's claim. The reason for this option in the ICSD was to encourage investors to take some care in choosing investment firms, but it is unrealistic to expect retail investors to be able to identify which firms are more or less likely to be affected by fraud or systems failures. Eliminating this option will provide increased investor protection under the ICSD as clients will no longer have to bear part of the loss if there is fraud at a firm or other problems with the firm's systems. Moreover, the provision giving Member States the option of excluding from coverage of the compensation scheme funds in currencies other than of the Member States’ is eliminated. This provides better protection to investors as it ensures that clients' funds are covered irrespective of the currency involved. Payout delays: the ICSD establishes a strict deadline for reimbursement (at the latest within three months). However, processing claims takes considerably longer than the limits set, possibly up to several years as evidenced by recent cases. The proposed amendment introduces the obligation for schemes to provisionally pay partial compensation based on an initial assessment of the claim if payout delay exceeds a specified time period. The level of the partial payment will amount to one third of the initial assessment of the claim. The balance will be paid out later once the claim had been fully verified. Schemes will also need the ability to recover amounts provisionally paid out if it was subsequently determined that the claim was not in fact valid. The amendments also provide that a competent authority must make a determination of whether a firm is unable to meet its obligations to investors within three months. This is to mitigate concerns about individual cases where competent authorities could be very slow to make a determination. Investor information : the ICSD requires Member States to ensure that investment firms make available to investors information about the relevant investor compensation scheme including the amount and scope of cover. Information must be made available in a readily comprehensible manner. However, concerns have been raised about how this provision has been applied in practice in the Member States. The directive is amended to require that UCITS managers disclose to investors in clear terms what is effectively covered by schemes (e.g. investment risk is usually not covered). Under this proposal the existing obligation for investment firms to provide information about compensation schemes to new clients will be supplemented by requiring further detail to be provided about what is compensated under the ICSD and how it applies in cross border situations and require them to clearly explain that certain losses (e.g. due to investment risks) are not subject to the payment of compensation under the ICSD. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal aims at enabling Greenland to participate in the Kimberley Process certification scheme on rough diamonds through its cooperation with the European Union. The scheme set out in the proposal would allow for the import and export of rough diamonds from Greenland to the Union as well as to other participants of the certification scheme, provided that all imports and exports of rough diamonds are verified and, for exports, certified by Union authorities pursuant to the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 implementing the Kimberley Process certification scheme for the international trade in rough diamonds. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Greenland and Denmark undertake to transpose and implement in the legislation applicable to Greenland the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 as regards the conditions and formalities for importing and exporting rough diamonds, their transit to a participant other than the Union, the participation of the Union, including Greenland, in the Kimberley Process certification scheme and associated obligations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal extends the territory of the Union to also cover the territory of Greenland for the purposes of the Kimberley Process certification scheme. Accordingly, Greenland will be prohibited to accept imports or exports of rough diamonds to or from outside of the territory of the Union without a valid Kimberley Process (KP) certificate. The amendments will allow for the export of rough diamonds from Greenland to third countries as long as they are accompanied by an EU KP certificate. The conditions for certification previously required evidence that the rough diamonds were lawfully imported into the Union. For diamonds mined and extracted in Greenland that have never been exported before, an alternative condition is introduced by this proposal, notably to demonstrate proof in this regard. In addition, the proposal: sets out the modalities of submitting rough diamonds to Union authorities for verification, extends the special rules for transit to Greenland. enables Greenland's participation in the Committee for the implementation of the Regulation, and enables Greenland's representation in the Kimberley Process and cooperation with other Member States through the Commission. The proposal is closely connected to a proposal for a Council Decision setting out specific rules for the circulation of rough diamonds between the Union and Greenland. The application of that Decision is proposed to align with the entry into force of this amendment to the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU’s budget."
4257EP7,"""""Transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market""""",0.842,0.905,0.982,0.581,0.515,0.855,0.897,0.657,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 2004/109/EC (Transparency Directive) in order to provide for the simplification of certain issuers' obligations with a view to making regulated markets more attractive for small and medium-sized issuers raising capital in Europe. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission’s report on the operation of the Transparency Directive shows that the transparency requirements of the Directive are considered to be useful for the proper and efficient functioning of the market by a majority of stakeholders. However, the review of the operation of the Transparency Directive also showed that there are areas where the regime it created could be improved. In particular, Improvement of the regulatory environment for small and medium-sized issuers and their access to capital are high political priorities for the Commission, as noted in the Single Market Act Communication of April 2011. It is thus desirable to provide for the simplification of certain issuers' obligations with a view to making regulated markets more attractive for small and medium-sized issuers raising capital in Europe. Additionally, the legal clarity and effectiveness of the existing transparency regime needs to be increased, notably with respect to the disclosure of corporate ownership. Lastly, the Commission Communication on reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial services sector envisages EU legislative action to set minimum common standards on certain key issues of sanctioning regimes, to be adapted to the specifics of the different sectors. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. It sets out the best policy options which were retained in the proposal: (i) allow for more flexibility regarding the frequency and timing of publication of periodical financial information, in particular for small and medium-sized issuers : abolish the obligation to present quarterly financial reports for all listed companies. Introducing differentiated disclosure regimes for companies listed on a regulated market according to their size was considered undesirable as such a regime would introduce double standards for the same market segment and would therefore be confusing for investors. The preferred policy option reduces compliance costs for all companies listed on regulated markets but should in particular benefit the smaller ones, reducing considerably the administrative burden linked to the publication and preparation of quarterly information. This option: ·  enables the small and medium-sized issuers to redirect their resources to publish the kind of information that suits best their investors;  should reduce short term pressure on issuers and incentivise investors to adopt a longer term vision. It should not have negative impact on investor protection, which is already sufficiently guaranteed through the mandatory disclosure of half yearly and yearly financial results, as well as through the disclosures required by the Market Abuse and Prospectus Directives; (ii) simplify the narrative parts of financial reports for small and medium-sized issuers : require ESMA to prepare non binding guidance (templates) on narrative content of the financial reports for all listed companies. This option allows for cost savings and improves comparability of information for investors. It also increases the cross-border visibility of the small and medium-sized issuers; (iii) eliminate the gaps in requirements for notification concerning major holdings of voting rights: extend the disclosure regime to all instruments of similar economic effect to holding of shares and entitlements to acquire shares. This option captures cash settled derivatives as well as any future similar financial instruments and closes a gap in the existing disclosure regime. It has a strong positive impact on investor protection and market confidence as it discourages secret stock building in listed companies; (iv) eliminate divergences in notification requirements for major holdings : harmonise the regime for the disclosure of major holdings of voting rights by requiring the aggregation of holdings of shares with those of financial instruments giving access to shares (including the cash settled derivatives). This option creates a uniform approach, reduces legal uncertainty, enhances transparency, simplifies cross-border investments and reduces its costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 50 and Article 114. CONTENT: the proposal contains the following provisions: Choice of the home Member State for third country issuers : the Transparency Directive is currently unclear with regard to which country is the home Member State for issuers who have to choose their home Member State but who have not done so. It is important that the Transparency Directive does not provide for any possibility to implement the rules in such a way that a listed company can operate without being under the supervision of any Member State. Therefore, a default home Member State is established for third country issuers who have not chosen their home Member State in accordance with Article 2(1) (i) during a period of three months. The requirement to publish interim management statements and/ or quarterly reports is abolished for all listed companies . The publication of such information is not considered necessary for investor protection and should therefore be left to the market in order to eliminate unnecessary administrative burden. For the sake of efficiency and in order to provide for a harmonised regime for disclosure, Member States should not continue to impose such an obligation in their national legislation. Currently, many Member States impose stricter disclosure requirements than the minimum foreseen in the Directive. In order to ensure that all listed companies in the EU benefit from equal treatment and that the administrative burden is effectively reduced, Member States should be prevented from gold plating and should not require more than what is necessary for investor protection. Broad definition of financial instruments subject to notification requirement . In order to take account of financial innovation and ensure that issuers and investors have full knowledge of the structure of corporate ownership, the definition of financial instrument should be broadened to cover all instruments of similar economic effect to holdings of shares and entitlements to acquire shares, whether giving right to a physical settlement or not. Currently, the Transparency Directive does not require notification of certain types of financial instruments that do not give the right to acquire voting rights, but which can be used to build secret stakes in listed companies without being disclosed to the market. Greater harmonisation for notification of major holdings - aggregation of holdings of shares with holdings of financial instruments . The Transparency Directive does not require aggregation of holdings of voting rights with holdings of financial instruments to calculate the thresholds for notification of major holdings. Member States have adopted different approaches in this field, resulting in a fragmented market and additional costs for cross-border investors. Holdings of shares need to be aggregated with the holdings of financial instruments for the calculation of notification thresholds. Netting of long and short positions should not be allowed. The notification should include the breakdown by type of financial instruments held to provide the market with detailed information on the nature of the holdings. However, in order to take into account the differences in ownership concentration, Member States should continue to be allowed to set lower national thresholds for notification of major holdings than those provided in the Transparency Directive where this is necessary to ensure appropriate transparency of holdings. Storage of regulated information : access to financial information on listed companies on a pan-European basis is currently burdensome. Interested parties need to go through 27 different national databases in order to search for information. In order to facilitate cross-border access to regulated information, the current network of officially appointed storage mechanisms should be enhanced. It is proposed that the Commission receives further delegated powers in this respect, in particular regarding the access to regulated information at the Union level. ESMA should assist the European Commission by developing draft regulatory technical standards concerning, for example, the operation of a central access point for the search of regulated information at the Union level. These measures should also be used to prepare the possible future creation of a single European storage mechanism ensuring storage of regulated information at the Union level. Reporting of payments to governments : the Commission has publicly expressed support for the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), and envisaged willingness to present legislation mandating disclosure requirements for extractive industry companies. Furthermore, the European Parliament has adopted a Resolution reiterating its support for country-by-country reporting requirements, in particular for the extractive industries. EU legislation does not currently require issuers to disclose, on a country basis, payments to governments made in countries where they operate. In order to make governments accountable for the use of these resources and promote good governance, it is proposed to require the disclosure of payments to governments at the individual or consolidated level of a company. The Transparency Directive requires issuers to disclose payments to governments by referring to the relevant provisions of Directive 2011/../EU Council on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings which provides for the detailed requirements in this respect. This proposal is comparable to the US Dodd-Frank Act, which was adopted in July 2010, and requires extractive industry companies (oil, gas and mining companies) registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to publicly report payments to government son a country- and project-specific basis. Sanctions and investigation : the sanctioning powers of competent authorities are enhanced. In particular, the publication of sanctions is important to improve transparency and to maintain confidence in the financial markets. Sanctions should normally be published, except in certain well-defined circumstances. In addition, the competent authorities in the Member States should have the power to suspend the exercise of voting rights of the issuer who had breached the notification rules on major holdings, as this is the most efficient sanction to prevent a breach of these rules. In order to ensure consistent application of sanctions, uniform criteria should be set for determining the actual sanction applicable to a person or a company. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called ‘Open Skies’ cases, on 5 June 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral air services agreements with an agreement at Union level (horizontal authorisation). The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. In accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the ‘horizontal authorisation’, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with China that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and China. The Agreement was signed, subject to its conclusion at a later date. CONTENT: The draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the People's Republic of China on certain aspects of air services. The purpose of the agreement is to bring existing bilateral air services agreements between 27 Member States and China into line with EU law: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause which allows all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment; - Article 4 resolves potential conflicts with EU competition rules."
4001EP7,"""""Prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms""""",0.123,0.938,0.947,0.548,0.333,0.892,0.903,0.0,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to strengthen prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms that relate strictly to the functioning of banking and financial services markets and are meant to ensure the financial stability of the operators on these markets as well as a high level of protection of investors and depositors. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the extent of the financial crisis has exposed unacceptable risks pertaining to the current regulation of financial institutions. According to IMF estimates, crisis-related losses incurred by European credit institutions between 2007 and 2010 are close to €1 trillion or 8% of the EU GDP. In order to restore stability in the banking sector and ensure that credit continues to flow to the real economy, both the EU and its Member States adopted a broad range of unprecedented measures with the taxpayer ultimately footing the related bill. In this context, by October 2010 the Commission has approved €4.6 trillion of state aid measures to financial institutions of which more than €2 trillion were effectively used in 2008 and 2009. The level of fiscal support provided to credit institutions needs to be matched with a robust reform addressing the regulatory shortcomings exposed during the crisis. Priorities and challenges : it should be noted that one of the priorities of the Commission in the reform of EU financial services regulation has been to ensure that the banking sector is able to fulfil its fundamental purpose, namely lending to the real economy and providing services to citizens and businesses in Europe. The proposal is designed to tackle regulatory shortcomings in the following areas: Management of liquidity risk : existing liquidity risk management practices were shown by the crisis to be inadequate in fully grasping risks linked to originate-to-distribute securitization, use of complex financial instruments and reliance on wholesale funding with short term maturity instruments. Definition of capital : institutions entered the crisis with capital of insufficient quantity and quality. Given the risks they faced, many institutions did not posses sufficient amounts of the highest quality capital instruments that can absorb losses effectively as they arise and help to preserve an institution as a going concern. Counterparty credit risk : the crisis revealed a number of shortcomings in the current regulatory treatment of counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives, repo and securities financing activities. It showed that the existing provisions did not ensure appropriate management and adequate capitalisation for this type of risk. Options, discretions and harmonisation (entire Regulation) : in 2000, seven banking directives were replaced by a single Directive. This directive was recast in 2006 while introducing the Basel II framework in the EU. As a result, its current provisions include a significant number of options and discretions. Moreover, Member States have been permitted to impose stricter rules than those of the Directive. As a result, there is a high level of divergence which is particularly burdensome for firms operating cross-border. It also gives rise to the lack of legal clarity and an uneven playing field. Action at international level : the G20 Declaration of 2 April 2009 on Strengthening of the Financial System called for internationally consistent efforts that are aimed at strengthening transparency, accountability and regulation by, improving the quantity and quality of capital in the banking system once the economic recovery is assured. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued detailed rules of new global regulatory standards on credit institution capital adequacy and liquidity that collectively are referred to as Basel III. This proposal directly relates to the regulatory standards included in Basel III. At the same time, in the process of developing this legislative proposal, the Commission has made particular efforts in making sure that certain major European specificities and issues are appropriately addressed. Creating a new legal framework : Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/EC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (""institutions"") have been significantly amended on several occasions. Many provisions of Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC are applicable to both credit institutions and investment firms. In order to ensure a coherent application of those provisions, it would be desirable to merge these provisions into new legislation applicable to both credit institutions and investment firms. For sake of clarity, the provisions of the Annexes to those Directives should be integrated into the enacting terms of this new legislation. That new legislation should consist of two different legal instruments, a Directive and this Regulation. Together, both legal instruments should form the legal framework governing the access to the activity, the supervisory framework and the prudential rules for credit institutions and investment firms. This Regulation should therefore be read together with the Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: altogether, 27 policy options have been assessed and compared with a view to addressing the various issues identified. Preferred options are as follows: · Introduce Liquid Coverage Ratio (LCR) adopted by Basel Committee subject to observation period. · Introduce Net Stable Funding ratio (NSFR) adopted by Basel Committee subject to observation period. · Modify eligibility criteria and regulatory adjustments based on Basel approach, with some adjustments for EU specificities. · Enhance Counterparty credit risk (CCR) requirements and differentiate treatment of exposures to Central Counterparties. · Introduce leverage ratio. · Conduct extensive monitoring of leverage ratio. · Conservation capital buffer. · Maximum harmonization with some exceptions. · Limit scope of the CRD and propose a regulation. Cumulative impacts of the proposed package are as follows: this proposal together with CRD III is estimated to increase the risk-weighted assets of large credit institutions by 24.5% and of small credit institutions by a modest 4.1%; the need to raise new own funds due to the new requirement and the conservation buffer is estimated to be €84 billion by 2015 and €460 billion by 2019; there are clear net long term economic benefits of an annual increase in the EU GDP in the range of 0.3%-2%. They stem from a reduction in the expected frequency and probability of future systemic crises; the proposal would reduce the probability of a systemic banking crisis in seven Member States within the range of 29% to 89% when credit institutions recapitalise to a total capital ratio of at least 10.5%. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114(1) TFEU provides a legal basis for a Regulation creating uniform provisions aimed at the functioning of the internal market. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation streamlines the prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, which are currently set out in two different Directives (2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC), in one legal instrument, which considerably simplifies the applicable legal framework. The individual policy measures proposed are as follows: Management of liquidity risk : To improve short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of financial institutions, a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) will be introduced after an observation and review period in 2015. LCR would require institutions to match net liquidity outflows during a 30 day period with a buffer of 'high quality' liquid assets. The outflows covered (the denominator) would reflect both institution-specific and systemic shocks built upon actual circumstances experienced in the global financial crisis. The provisions on the list of high quality liquid assets (the numerator) to cover these outflows should ensure that these assets are of high credit and liquidity quality. Based on the LCR definition included in Basel III, compliance with this requirement in the EU is expected to produce net annual GDP benefits in the range of 0.1% to 0.5%, due to a reduction in the expected frequency of systemic crises. To address funding problems arising from asset-liability maturity mismatches, the Commission will consider proposing a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) after an observation and review period in 2018. Definition of capital : The proposal builds upon the changes made in CRD2 to strengthen further the criteria for eligibility of capital instruments. Furthermore, it introduces significant harmonisation of the adjustments made to accounting equity in order to determine the amount of regulatory capital that it is prudent to recognise for regulatory purposes. This new harmonised definition would significantly increase the amount of regulatory capital required to be held by institutions. The new requirements for going concern regulatory capital - Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital - would be implemented gradually between 2013 and 2015. The new prudential adjustments would also be introduced gradually, 20% per annum from 2014, reaching 100% in 2018. Grandfathering provisions over 10 years would also apply to certain capital instruments in order to help to ensure a smooth transition to the new rules. Counterparty credit risk : Requirements for management and capitalisation of the counterparty credit risk will be strengthened. Institutions would be subject to an additional capital charge for possible losses associated with the deterioration in the creditworthiness of a counterparty. Risk weights on exposures to financial institutions relative to the non-financial corporate sector will be raised. The proposal would also enhance incentives for clearing over-the-counter instruments through central counterparties. Leverage ratio : in order to limit an excessive build-up of leverage on credit institutions' and investment firms' balance sheets and thus help containing the cyclicality of lending, the Commission also proposes to introduce a non-risk based leverage ratio. As agreed by BCBS, it will be introduced as an instrument for the supervisory review of institutions. The impacts of the ratio will be monitored with a view to migrating it to a binding pillar one measure in 2018, based on appropriate review and calibration, in line with international agreements. Single rule book (entire Regulation): the proposal harmonises divergent national supervisory approaches by removing options and discretions almost altogether. Some specific well defined areas, where divergences are driven by risk assessment considerations, market or product specificities and Member States' legal frameworks, are exempted, allowing Member States to adopt stricter rules. BUDGETARY IMPACT: EBA will play an important role in achieving the objective of this Regulation, as the proposals ask it to develop more than 50 binding technical standards (BTS) on various policy issues. BTS – which would eventually be endorsed by the Commission – will be key to ensure that provisions of highly technical nature are implemented uniformly across the EU and that the proposed policies work as intended. For this significant workload, EBA would need more resources than those already provided within the context of its establishment under Regulation (EU) 1093/2010. Further details are set out in the attached legislative financial statement. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the crisis caused by the COVID 19 epidemic is increasing the risks for the most vulnerable, in particular the most deprived, and may in particular disrupt the support provided by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The distribution of food and basic material assistance, as well as social inclusion support, is facing increasingly logistical and human resource constraints, notably due to the confinement and urgent need to instate social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus. Many of the volunteers, who are the backbone of the Fund, can no longer be mobilised, as they often belong to groups at a higher risk of severe illness caused by COVID-19. The Fund's main objective is to support the development of the country's capacity to provide food and basic material assistance. Specific measures must be taken as a matter of urgency in order to protect the most vulnerable from this disease and to ensure that they continue to receive assistance from the FEAD, in particular with regard to the provision of the necessary protective equipment against the disease. This initiative complements the first ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’, a package of measures proposed by the Commission on 13 March 2020 which introduced a number of important changes to provide a more effective response to the current situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in order to address the difficulties encountered by public authorities and partner organisations in implementing the FEAD during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific measures The proposed measures provide for the following:  eligibility of expenditure incurred from 1 February 2020 for FEAD operations that strengthen the capacity to respond to the coronavirus pandemic; the possibility to give Member States the exceptional possibility to apply for a co-financing rate of 100% for the accounting year 2020-2021; flexibility for Member States (i) to adjust the schemes of support to the current context, including by allowing alternative schemes of delivery through electronic vouchers (lower risk of contamination) and by allowing Member States (ii) to amend certain elements of the operational programme without requiring an adoption by Commission decision; possibility to provide the necessary protective materials and equipment to partner organisations outside the technical assistance budget; flexibility measures which reduce the administrative burden on the authorities in terms of compliance with certain legislative requirements, in particular as regards monitoring and control and audit; specific provisions regarding the eligibility of costs incurred by beneficiaries in case the delivery of food/basic material assistance or social assistance is delayed as well as for suspended and not fully implemented operations. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments set out in the FEAD Regulation. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived remains unchanged. The proposal will facilitate an acceleration of programme implementation and result in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission will carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp drop in rail traffic, because of a significant fall in demand. This has had a serious impact on railway undertakings. Those circumstances are beyond the control of railway undertakings that have continuously faced considerable liquidity problems, major losses and in some cases are risking insolvency. In order to counteract the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and support railway undertakings, Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 of the European Parliament and of the Council enabled Member States to authorise infrastructure managers to reduce, waive or defer charges for accessing rail infrastructure. That possibility was granted for a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020 and was further extended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1061 until 31 December 2021. The Commission is no longer empowered to extend further that reference period. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing therefore the reference period of Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 should be extended until 30 June 2022 to ensure continuity in the application of the measures. CONTENT: the Commission proposal aims to extend the reference period until 30 June 2022, and to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts to further extend such period until 31 December 2023. It is also proposed that the delegation of power should end on the same date, that is, 31 December 2023. All other provisions of the current Regulation should remain unchanged. The Commission should continuously analyse the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the rail sector and the Union should be in a position to prolong without undue delay the period of application of the measures provided for by this Regulation if the adverse conditions persist. In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, it should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency established, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and the European Council support the national authorities in the exercise of most of these functions. They should therefore strengthen their cooperation with each other and with those national authorities carrying out coastguard functions in order to increase the maritime situational awareness and to support coherent and cost-efficient action. CONTENT: the purpose of this legislative proposal is to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the relevant Member States' authorities, EU agencies and other bodies performing coastguard functions with a view to moving towards a European Coastguard Capacity/System. It forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and a proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The substantive amendments in this proposal are identical to the proposed amendments to the Regulation establishing EMSA and the proposed provisions on European coastguard cooperation in the proposal for a Regulation establishing European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The proposed Regulation covers: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the Agencies. It will foster intelligence sharing amongst the Agencies; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building at national and Union level by elaborating guidelines, recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhance the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions. Thanks to its international mandate, the EFCA has, so far, developed robust expertise in implementing common inspection platforms and maintains privileged network with EU and third countries such as Albania, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. It will permit the EFCA to increase its control and inspection activities and conduct new type of operations aiming at detecting criminal activities, disrupt trafficking routes and ensure the enforcement of EU and national legislations. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative will imply an increase in the EU contribution to the EFCA of around EUR 7.5 million per year (that is EUR 30.148 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 13 TA staff."
3580EP8,"""""Emission limits for non-road mobile machinery""""",0.914,0.937,0.94,0.146,0.173,0.97,0.921,0.923,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to protect human health and the environment, and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for engines in non-road mobile machinery (NRMM). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the emissions limits for non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) are currently set out in Directive 97/68/EC. This Directive was amended a number of times, but several technical reviews have concluded that the legislation in its current form has shortcomings. Non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) covers a large variety of combustion engines installed in machines ranging from small handheld equipment, construction machinery and generating sets, to railcars, locomotives and inland waterway vessels. These engines contribute significantly to air pollution and are accountable for roughly 15% of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and 5% of the particulate matter (PM) emissions in the EU. The proposal also ties in with the industrial policy update of 2012 and could make an important contribution to technical harmonisation in the context of the EU-US trade negotiations (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - TTIP). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment took into account in the analytical design that the preferred choice might be a combination of elements from different options. Alongside the no-policy change scenario, these options are: alignment with US standards in scope and limit values. step towards road sector ambition levels, for the most relevant emission sources. extended level of ambition through enhanced monitoring provisions. CONTENT: the proposal significantly upgrades the NRMM engine type-approval system with respect to the technical requirements on emissions by adopting stricter levels, as well as introducing the “split-level approach” which is already used in other pieces of legislation in the area of EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach foresees legislation in two steps: first, the fundamental provisions will be laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on the ordinary legislative procedure; secondly, the technical specifications implementing the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU. The draft proposal and its implementing and delegated acts will carry over and improve on the existing requirements laid down in Directive 97/68/EC. Compared to the existing act, the proposal for a regulation will: introduce new emission limits reflecting technological progress and EU policies in the on-road sector, with a view to achieving EU air quality targets; extend the scope , with a view to improving market harmonisation (EU and international) and minimising the risk of market distortions; introduce measures for simplifying administrative procedures and improving enforcement, including conditions for better market surveillance. In particular, the delegated acts adopted under this proposal will include, amongst others: detailed technical requirements of the test cycles; technical test and measurement procedures; detailed arrangements and requirements for the exceptions granted under this Regulation; detailed provisions for type-approval procedures. The proposal also provides general and specific transitional periods in order to allow sufficient lead time for engine and machinery manufacturers, as well as for administrations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the cost associated to setting up an electronic database for the exchange of type-approval information was already assessed in a feasibility study commissioned by the UNECE in June 2006. The study predicted one off start-up costs in the EUR 50 000 to EUR 150 000 range and operating costs of EUR 5 000 to EUR 15 000 per month, depending on the length of the contract with the service provider. A similar monthly range is provided for operating a help desk service, if required. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
3337EP7,"""""Approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles""""",0.807,0.923,0.93,0.452,0.333,0.88,0.877,0.657,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to simplify the current legal framework, to contribute to a lower, more proportionate share of overall road transport emissions, and to increase vehicle safety for new two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles (L-category vehicles) entering the EU market. PROPOSED ACT: European Parliament and Council Regulation. BACKGROUND: type-approval requirements for new vehicles of the L-category are currently set out in Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (the ‘Framework Directive’). In addition, a series of Directives referred to in the Framework Directive contain detailed technical requirements relating to L-category vehicles. The Commission has identified a number of key concerns associated with the current provisions for the type-approval of new L-category vehicles, which need to be addressed: the complexity of the legal framework; the level of emissions and its increasing share in total road transport emissions, which are decreasing overall; vehicle functional safety aspects related to type-approval requirements; the lack of a legal framework for vehicles fitted with new technologies; selling and registration of certain vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units imported in the EU market which do not comply with the current type-approval requirements regarding vehicle functional safety and/or environmental protection. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: for each of the main aspects of the proposal, different options were analysed by listing possible advantages and disadvantages in terms of economic, environmental, safety and societal aspects. Qualitative and quantitative aspects were both included in this analysis. Next, the different options were compared and one preferred option or a logical combination of two preferred options were identified and described. These preferred options form the basis for this new Framework Regulation. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal uses the ‘split-level approach’ originally introduced at the request of Parliament and used in other legislation for EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach provides for legislation in three steps: the fundamental provisions and scope are laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on Article 114 TFEU in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. the technical specifications associated with the fundamental provisions are laid down in three delegated acts (Article 290), adopted through comitology: an implementing act (Article 291) sets out the administrative provisions, such as the information document, the definitions of the type-approval certificate, the certificate of conformity and associated production conformity requirements, etc. This proposal for a Regulation relates to the first step of this process. It establishes the administrative and technical requirements for the approval and market surveillance of all new L-category vehicles that are intended to travel on public roads, including where designed and constructed in more than one stage. It also establishes the requirements for the sale and entry into service of systems, components and separate technical units intended for vehicles approved in accordance with this Regulation. In the interests of clarity, rationality and simplification, Directive 2002/24/EC and its separate directives should be repealed and replaced by one Regulation and a small number of delegated and implementing acts. This Regulation constitutes a set of specific safety and environmental requirements. It establishes provisions to ensure that, in cases where a vehicle presents a serious risk for users or the environment, the manufacturer or any other economic operator in the supply chain has taken effective protective measures, including the recall of vehicles. In addition, appropriate measures should be taken in order to make sure that systems, components or separate technical units which can be fitted to vehicles, and which could significantly impair the functioning of systems that are essential for environmental protection or functional safety, are subject to prior control by an approval authority before they are sold, registered or are entering into service. To improve market surveillance, the role and responsibilities of the authorities in the Member States in charge of type-approval and market surveillance are clarified. The proposal also reinforces the requirements relating to the competence, obligations and performance of the technical services that perform vehicle type-approval. In order to prevent misuse, any simplified procedure for small-series vehicles should be restricted to cases of very limited production. It is therefore necessary to define precisely the concept of small series in terms of the number of vehicles sold, registered and entered into service. In order to ensure that the procedure for monitoring conformity of production is correctly implemented and functions properly, manufacturers should be regularly checked by the competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service appointed for that purpose. Lastly, Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no implications for the European Union budget with regard to the first two emission-limit reduction steps (Euro 4 and 5 for motorcycles, Euro 3 and 4 for all other L-category vehicle categories). The third emission step will include a Euro 6 step motorcycles and a Euro 5 step for all other L-category vehicle categories (mopeds, tricycles and quadricycles). These limits are absolutely equivalent to the Euro 5 emission limits for passenger cars. An additional environmental effect study is planned in order to determine the short-term environmental effects of the Euro 3, 4 and 5 steps and whether the targeted Euro 6 step is appropriate within the given time. This study will be completed in the period 2016-2017 and will be financed through the Commission budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and Russia was signed in Brussels on 16 November 2000 and entered into force on 10 May 2001. The Agreement is renewable by common agreement between the parties for additional periods of five-years. The Agreement has been renewed three times, in 2004, 2009 and 2014, for an additional period of five years each time. The current Agreement expired on 20 February 2019. Both parties confirmed their intention to renew the agreement for an additional period of five years without any amendments. CONTENT: under the draft Council Decision, the renewal of the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation for an additional period of five years would be approved on behalf of the European Union. The substance of the renewed Agreement will be identical to that of the current Agreement as discussed and agreed with the Russian counterparts. It will not create new rights and obligations for the EU, but instead it will extend in time the legal regime already existing between the Parties in the field of science and technology cooperation. The renewal of the Agreement fits within the EU's approach based on the five guiding principles to manage the EU’s current relations with Russia, agreed upon at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 14 March 2016 and confirmed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 16 April 2018. The Agreement provides a framework to enhance people-to-people contacts and science, technology and innovation cooperation in areas of EU strategic interest in the years to come, countering the trend of decreasing intensity of scientific collaboration between EU and Russian participants."
10603EP9,"""""Amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol""""",0.984,0.945,0.0,0.589,0.456,0.935,0.909,0.024,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to establish a specific alert category issued by Europol in SIS in order to exchange information on persons who represent a threat to the internal security of the European Union. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: given the increasingly global nature of serious crime and terrorism brought about by growing mobility, the information that third countries and international organisations obtain about criminals and terrorists is increasingly relevant for the EU‘s security. Such information should contribute to the comprehensive efforts to ensure internal security in the European Union. Some of this information is only shared with Europol. While Europol holds valuable information received from external partners on serious criminals and terrorists, it cannot issue alerts in SIS. Member States are also not always able to issue alerts in SIS on the basis of such information. In order to bridge the gap in information sharing on serious crime and terrorism, in particular on foreign terrorist fighters – where the monitoring of their movement is crucial – it is necessary to ensure Europol is able to make this information available directly and in real-time to front-line officers in Member States. Europol should therefore be authorised to enter alerts in SIS, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules. To that end, the Commission proposes that a specific category of alert should be created in SIS, to be issued exclusively by Europol, in order to inform end-users carrying out a search in SIS that the person concerned is suspected of being involved in a criminal offence in respect of which Europol is competent, and in order for Europol to obtain confirmation that the person who is subject to the alert has been located. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: the present proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol. In particular, it widens the scope of application of the current SIS by introducing a new alert category for Europol. Specific provisions The proposal seeks to: - enable Europol to issue ‘information alerts’ on suspects and criminals as a new alert category in SIS, for exclusive use by Europol in specific and well-defined cases and circumstances. This is an important paradigm change for SIS, as until now, only Member States could enter, update and delete data in SIS and Europol had ‘read-only’ access covering all alert categories. Europol would be able to issue alerts on the basis of its analysis of third-country sourced information or information from international organisations, within the scope of crimes falling under Europol’s mandate and only on third-country nationals who are not beneficiaries of free movement rights. The purpose of the new alert category is that in case of a ‘hit’, the alert would inform the frontline officer that Europol holds information on the person; - set out detailed provisions on the procedural requirements that Europol is required to fulfil prior to entering an alert in SIS; - align the obligations and requirements of Europol when entering alerts in SIS with alert issuing Member States. These requirements concern: categories of data, proportionality, minimum data content for an alert to be entered, entering biometric data, general data processing rules, quality of the data in SIS as well as rules on distinguishing between persons with similar characteristics, misused identity and links. The frontline officer would be required to report immediately the occurrence of the ‘hit’ to the national SIRENE Bureau, which would in turn contact Europol. The frontline officer would only report that the person who is subject of an alert was located and would indicate the place, time and reason for the check carried out; - define the review period for alerts entered by Europol as well as the alert deletion rules which are specific to this type of alert. As a general rule, an alert should be kept only for the time that is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact, estimated at EUR 1 820 000 for the period 2021-2022, reflects the changes required for establishing this new alert category in Central SIS by eu-LISA, the EU Agency responsible for the management and development of Central SIS. The expenses related to the development of the national systems connected to Central SIS are to be covered by the resources available to the Member States under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 for the development and maintenance of SIS. The proposal would also require Europol to set up a technical interface for entering, updating and deleting data in Central SIS."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the Schengen acquis, third-country nationals who are legally resident or staying in a Member State can move freely within the territory of the other Member States, provided they fulfil certain conditions. However, in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. Following the Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the technical work carried out in the Health Security Committee and the e-Health network, the Commission has put forward (in parallel with this proposal) a proposal for a Digital Green Certificate Regulation to establish an EU-wide framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework set out in the proposal for a Regulation on a digital green certificate applies to Union citizens or their family members who may be a third country national. This proposal has the objective of ensuring that the same framework applies to other third-country nationals who are legally staying or legally residing on the territory of an EU Member State and who are entitled to travel to another Member State in accordance with Union law. CONTENT: the proposal aims to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates of COVID-19 vaccination, testing and recovery. In concrete terms, the interoperable green digital certificate will prove that a person has been vaccinated against, tested negative for or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available free of charge, either electronically or paper format, and will include a QR code to ensure its security and authenticity. Member States should apply the rules set out in the future Regulation on a digital green certificate to third-country nationals who do not fall within the scope of that Regulation but who are legally resident or staying in their territory and are authorised to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. This proposal establishes neither an obligation nor a right to vaccination. Vaccination strategies are a national competence of the Member States. The proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The digital green certificate would thus be open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland."
3092EP7,"""""Sulphur content of marine fuels""""",0.596,0.861,0.895,0.194,0.515,0.807,0.851,0.857,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to amend Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur content of marine fuels with a view to reducing air pollution and improve human health and the environment. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he EU actions over the past decades have resulted in a considerable reduction of emissions of most air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds, ammonia and particulate matter (PM). The greatest share of these reductions has been achieved by land-based emission sources such as industrial plants or road transport. Evidence shows that further reduction of such pollutants will deliver significant benefits to the health of EU citizens, the environment, and the economy at large. Projections made in 2005 showed that without further regulatory action the continued growth in emissions of SO2 and NOx from the maritime sector will surpass total emissions of these pollutants from all land-based sources by 2020. Directive 1999/32/EC as amended regulates the sulphur content of fuels used by maritime transport and incorporates certain rules, agreed under the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), into EU law. In particular, the Directive incorporates more stringent rules on sulphur content of marine fuels to be used in areas in need of special environmental protection, the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). Since the amendment of the Directive in 2005, and with strong EU support, IMO rules, among others in relation to SO2, were revised in October 2008. These rules are contained in Annex VI of the Marine Pollution Convention 73/78 (Revised MARPOL Annex VI). The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010. It introduces, inter alia, stricter sulphur limits for marine fuel in SECAs (1.00% as of 1 July 2010 and 0.10% as of 1 January 2015) as well as in sea areas outside SECAs (3.5% as of 1 January 2012 and, in principle, 0.50% as of 1 January 2020). Most Member States are obliged to require ships to use fuel with maximum 1.00% sulphur content in SECAs as of 1 July 2010 based on their international commitments. In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in the Union, the provisions of Directive 1999/32/EC should be aligned with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in its analysis, the Commission: confirms the cost-effectiveness of the full alignment of the Directive with the IMO stricter fuel standards and the rules on emission abatement methods; recommends maintaining the link between the stricter fuel standards in SECAs and those applying for passenger ships on a regular service outside SECAs. However, the introduction of a new SECA standard for passenger ships would be delayed by 5 years in order to avoid potential problems with fuel availability. The benefit to cost ratios for this option range from 1.5 to 6 (if the 0.1% standard is introduced in 2020) and from 0.8 to 10 (if the 0.1% standard is introduced in 2025); suggests to first develop guidance on monitoring and implementation of the Directive and, should this approach fail, to consider adopting binding rules; recommends that the European Commission and Member States use and, where possible and necessary, adapt existing instruments, to assist industry in the transition towards the new best available technology standards. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal is consistent with the EU 2020 Strategy and its associated flagship initiatives, notably those relating to the low carbon society roadmaps and innovation Union , as well as existing EU policies for sustainable transport. The purpose of this proposal is to revise Directive 99/32/EC on the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels with the aim to: (1) align the Directive with the IMO rules on fuel standards, including the standards applicable outside SECAs; (2) align the Directive with the IMO rules on the emission abatement methods; (3) maintain the link between the stricter fuel standards in SECAs (now requiring maximum sulphur content of marine fuel of 1.5% and from 2015 - 0.1%) and those applying for passenger ships on a regular service outside SECAs (at the moment 1.5%); (4) strengthen EU monitoring and enforcement regime. According to the Commission, the main advantages of the proposed Regulation are as follows: incorporating the international fuel standards into EU law would strengthen the effectiveness of these standards as they would be monitored and enforced under the EU regime, which is more effective than the international enforcement system; extended access to and promoting the use of innovate emission abatement methods as an equivalent compliance option addresses concerns about the cost implications resulting from the new IMO rules for certain industries. This would significantly lower the IMO compliance costs (by 50% to 88%) and promote innovative industry solutions, in line with the priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy and Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU); stricter fuel standards for passenger ships on a regular service , which operate mostly in ports or close to shore, would ensure improvement of air quality in coastal areas. The introduction of the stricter fuel standard for passenger ships would be delayed by 5 years in comparison with SECAs in order to avoid potential problems with fuel availability; lastly, strengthening EU monitoring and enforcement regime is particularly important considering that the significantly stricter fuel standards and the associated compliance costs may increase the incentives for circumvention. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. To ensure a well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement, the Council adopted, on 13 October 2020, Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Member States have launched or plan to launch initiatives to issue vaccination certificates. However, for these to be used effectively in a cross-border context when citizens exercise their free movement rights, such certificates need to be fully interoperable, secure and verifiable. A commonly agreed approach is required among Member States on the content, format, principles and technical standards of such certificates. In their declaration adopted following the informal video conferences on 25-26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for further work on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission is working with Member States in the e-Health network, a voluntary network of national e-Health authorities, to prepare for the interoperability of these certificates. Work is also underway to develop a common harmonised data set for COVID-19 test result certificates. CONTENT: based on the technical work done so far, the proposed Regulation establishes the digital green certificate, which is a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital green certificate The interoperable digital green certificate should allow for the issuance, cross-border verification and acceptance of any of the following certificates: (i) vaccination certificates, (ii) certificates for screening tests (NAAT/RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) and (iii) certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. Member States should issue the certificates in a digital and/or paper-based format. Certificates issued by Member States should contain an interoperable barcode to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The certificates should be available free of charge and in the official language(s) of the issuing Member State as well as in English. Trust framework The Commission and the Member States should establish a digital trust framework infrastructure allowing for the secure issuance and verification of certificates and ensuring, as far as possible, interoperability with internationally established technology systems. The proposal also provides for the acceptance of secure and verifiable certificates issued by third countries to EU citizens and their family members according to an international standard that is interoperable with the trust framework established by the Regulation and that will contain the necessary personal data, following an implementing decision by the Commission. Issuance, content and acceptance of certificates The proposal provides details on the issuance, content and acceptance of the vaccination certificate, the test certificate and the certificate of recovery. The certificates would include a limited set of essential information such as name, date of birth, date of issue, relevant information on the vaccine administered/tested/recovery and a unique certificate identifier. The digital green certificate would be valid in all EU Member States and open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The possession of a ‘digital green certificate’, in particular a vaccination certificate, should not be a precondition for the exercise of free movement. In particular, the proposed Regulation cannot be interpreted as establishing an obligation or right to be vaccinated. Notification The proposal establishes a notification procedure to ensure that the other Member States and the Commission are informed of the restrictions on the right to free movement made necessary by the pandemic. Data protection The certificates should contain only such personal data as is necessary. Given that the personal data includes sensitive medical data, a very high level of data protection should be ensured and data minimisation principles should be preserved. In particular, the ‘Digital Green Certificate’ framework should not require the setting up and maintenance of a database at EU level but should allow for the decentralised verification of digitally signed interoperable certificates. Temporary measure The proposal foresees that the measures should be suspended once the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency."

6623EP7,"""""Payment accounts""""",0.246,0.853,0.982,0.516,0.303,0.892,0.892,0.743,0,1,0,0,"PURPOSE: to improve and develop the single market for retail banking. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the lack of transparency and comparability of charges and the difficulty of switching bank accounts continue to figure as obstacles to a fully integrated internal market for retail banking. A survey conducted by Eurobarometer in 2012 showed that only 3% of the respondents declared having opened a payment account cross-border. Consumers were dissuaded from purchasing retail financial products cross-border by unclear information (21%), lack of clarity of the rights available to the consumer (18%) or the process being too complicated (15%). Surveys and complaints from consumers demonstrate that many citizens have faced difficulties in opening a payment account due to their lack of a permanent address in the Member State where the payment service provider is located. This problem affects a large number of EU consumers living in another Member State (12.3 million people in 2010). Furthermore, the World Bank estimated that about 58 million EU consumers do not have a payment account and approximately 25 million of them would like to open one. The fact that a large number of consumers does not currently participate in the internal market for financial services has negative consequences for both payment service providers and consumers. Initiatives have already been taken in these areas : (i) the Payment Service Directive (2007/64/EC) provides certain transparency obligations with respect to the fees charged by payment service providers; (ii) following a request from the Commission in 2010, the banking industry at EU level proposed to develop, through self-regulation, a framework ensuring increased transparency on payment account fees; (iii) in July 2011 the Commission issued a Recommendation on access to a basic payment account. However, progress remains limited. The Single Market Act II adopted on 3 October 2012, identified a legislative initiative on bank accounts in the EU as one of the twelve priority actions to generate real effects on the ground and make citizens and businesses confident to use the single market to their advantage. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission prepared an impact assessment of policy options. These options concerned: (i) the scope of the new provisions, (ii) the level of standardisation, (iii) the setting up and functioning of measures on transparency and comparability of fees, switching between payment accounts, improved access to basic payment services and (iv) how to ensure their effective application for consumers. Following an assessment of the available options, the Commission concluded that in order to improve the functioning of the switching process, it is necessary to enact measures to give binding legal force to the provisions of the Common Principles on account switching. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the draft directive aims to: (i) improve the transparency and comparability of fee information relating to payment accounts, (ii) facilitate switching between payment accounts, (iii) eliminate discrimination based on residency with respect to payment accounts and (iv) provide access to a payment account with basic features within the EU. The directive will apply to payment accounts held by consumers. Consequently, accounts held by businesses are outside its scope. It will not cover savings accounts. 1) Transparency on fees : the proposal requires payment service providers to provide consumers with: ·  a fee information document containing information on the most representative payment services in each Member State, using the terms and definitions established at EU level where relevant; ·  a glossary drafted in clear, unambiguous and non-technical language, containing at least the list of payment services and the related definitions; ·  information on all the fees charged on the account at least annually. Consumers should be able to access comparison websites obtain to obtain impartial information on bank fees. 2) Changing accounts: the proposal: ·  requires Member States enact a general obligation for payment service providers to make a switching service available to any consumer who holds an account with a payment service provider located in the Union; ·  establishes the specific roles and obligations for the receiving and transferring payment service providers in the context of the switching service; ·  establishes principles to guarantee that the charges related to the switching services are appropriate and in line with the costs incurred; ·  establishes the obligation for payment service providers to refund charges incurred by consumers due to their mistake or delay during the switching service. 3) Access to a bank account: the proposal: ·  requires Member States to ensure that consumers are not discriminated against on the basis of their nationality or residence when applying for a payment account or in their use of a payment account; ·  establishes a right of access to a basic payment account for consumers in any Member State; ·  requires Member States to designate at least one payment service provider to offer a basic payment account; ·  requires Member States to ensure that services are offered by payment service providers free of charge or for a reasonable fee. ·  recalls that Directive 2007/64/EC is applicable to payment accounts with basic features. However the proposal provides for a limited list of grounds that may justify the termination of the framework contract of a payment account with basic features by the payment service provider. Lastly, the proposal requires Member States: (i) to establish specific requirements for the settlement of disputes between consumers and payment service providers; (ii) to establish rules on sanctions for breaches of the national provisions adopted to implement the directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
6781EP7,"""""Marine equipment""""",0.895,0.821,0.93,0.419,0.303,0.783,0.79,0.8,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to enhance safety at sea and the prevention of marine pollution through the uniform application of the relevant international instruments relating to equipment to be placed on board ships, and to ensure the free movement of such equipment within the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the international maritime safety conventions require flag States to ensure that the equipment carried on board ships complies with certain safety requirements as regards design, construction and performance, and to issue the relevant certificates. To that end, detailed performance and testing standards for certain types of marine equipment have been developed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and by the international and European standardisation bodies. The international instruments leave a significant margin of discretion to the flag administrations . Back in 1995, the Commission clearly identified the problems encountered in the Internal Market as a result of this state of affairs and in the absence of EU harmonisation in the marine equipment sector. Council Directive 96/98/EC on marine equipment (MED) thus laid down common rules to eliminate differences in the implementation of international standards by means of a clearly identified set of requirements and uniform certification procedures. Experience has shown that it is necessary to take additional measures in order to enhance the implementation and enforcement mechanisms of the said Directive and simplify the regulatory environment while guaranteeing that IMO requirements are applied and implemented in a harmonised way across the Union. Decision No 768/2008 (New Legislative Framework) constitutes a general framework of a horizontal nature for future legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products and a reference text for existing legislation. This general framework provides appropriate solutions to the problems identified in the implementation of Directive 96/98/EC. It is therefore necessary to incorporate the definitions and reference provisions of Decision No 768/2008 into this Directive by making the adaptations which are required by the specific features of the marine equipment sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment focused on two alternatives to the baseline (statu quo) scenario, namely: (i) a maximum alignment with the new legislative framework; and (ii) conditional alignment, allowing for a number of MED-specific measures in order to cater for the sector's particular features. The analysis showed that conditional alignment was the most effective and least burdensome solution and, at the same time, it had the most positive overall economic, social and environmental impacts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish requirements for marine equipment to meet the safety standards laid down in the applicable international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, in order to ensure that equipment which complies with these requirements can circulate unimpeded within the Internal Market and be placed on board ships flying the flag of any Member State . Scope : the scope of the Directive is defined by reference to equipment which is (a) due to be installed on board a ship flying the flag of a Member State , and (b) for which the approval of the flag State is required by the international conventions. Requirements for marine equipment : these are defined by reference to the international conventions and instruments. As required by these, demonstration of compliance is confined to the specific applicable testing standards. Given the need to ensure continued consistency with the international regulatory framework, these requirements and standards must apply in their up-to-date version. Responsibility : the proposal provides that the flag State has the responsibility to ensure that only equipment which has been duly approved in accordance with the then applicable requirements of the international instruments is placed on board ships flying its flag. In addition, the proposed Directive: provides the basis for the free movement of marine equipment within the EU, based on the concept of mutual recognition between Member States of equipment complying with the requirements laid down in the Directive; reflects the priority given to the international regulation of maritime safety, consistent with the global nature of shipping; governs the particular case of the transfer of a ship to a Member State's register based on the principle of compliance with the Directive’s requirements; established rules and conditions for affixing the wheel mark; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards the specific obligations of the economic operators; lists the conformity-checking procedures made available to manufacturers; aligns the Directive with Decision 768/2008 as regards the EU declaration of conformity; incorporates the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008 as regards notification, notifying authorities, notified bodies and their respective regimes; fully aligns the Directive with the general EU market surveillance framework, including as regards the safeguard procedure. Checks on board may be necessary and are therefore regulated; contains the specific regime in exceptional circumstances, largely taken from the existing Directive. This regime concerns exemptions in cases of technical innovation or for the purpose of testing and evaluation. Lastly, as regards the implementation measures, the Commission: shall be empowered to uniformly implement the requirement for marine equipment to comply with the specific design, construction and performance requirements laid down in the international instruments, including the relevant testing standards, as defined by the Legislator; is also empowered to adopt common criteria and procedures for the application of these requirements and standards; is charged with the task of gathering and publishing a significant package of information. This codifies and expands existing practice and will facilitate the implementation of the Directive by all actors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The tasks devolved to the Commission, including those for which the assistance of the European Maritime Safety Agency is foreseen, are not expected to represent an increase in workload and will be carried out with existing resources. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
5675EP8,"""""Inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry into the 2030 climate and energy framework""""",0.786,0.9,0.1,0.188,0.212,0.925,0.895,0.385,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to determine how to include land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) in the EU's climate and energy framework, from 2021. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: emissions and removals of greenhouse gases in LULUCF are currently covered by international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol only, up to 2020. Up to this date, the Kyoto Protocol places constraints on the EU and each of its Member States, as they need to ensure that the LULUCF sector does not yield extra emissions. However, the Kyoto Protocol will expire at the end of 2020. Consequently, governance for the LULUCF sector needs to be further developed within the EU. Currently, this is carried out under Decision No 529/2013/EU on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to LULUCF. Without a legal framework defining the applicable rules for the period post-2020, the way in which LULUCF would be included in the overall framework could be heterogeneous across the EU. The proposal is part of the legislation completing the integrated framework for climate and energy policies up to 2030 endorsed by the European Council in October 2014, to achieve the EU 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least -40% compared to 1990 levels domestically in a cost effective manner and contribute to limiting global warming. It is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the strategic framework for the Energy Union. It also aims to implement the EU’s commitments under the Paris Agreement (December 1995) on climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in the conclusion of the impact assessment, a stand-alone LULUCF policy pillar was identified as the preferred option. This would continue to be utilised together with the commitment by each Member State to ensure that the LULUCF sector should have no net emissions on their territory (no-debit rule). CONTENT: the proposal aims to define how the LULUCF sector will contribute to an EU-wide 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in non-ETS (emission trading scheme) sectors by 2030 compared to 2005. It lays down; the commitments by Member States towards meeting the greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment of the Union for the period from 2021 to 2030; accounting rules relating to emissions and absorption linked to LULUCF activity and to verification of Member States’ commitments. The mandatory scope is, in essence, forest land and agricultural land, and land for which the use has changed from or to these uses. The approach proposed discards the parallel Kyoto Protocol reporting framework and streamlines the system with the UNFCCC ""land-based"" reporting framework. The scope includes greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O. Furthermore, the proposal: provides that each Member State is to ensure that the LULUCF sector should have, after the application of the accounting rules specified in the Regulation, and taking into account the flexibilities, no net emissions on their territory (""no-debit rule""); lays down general rules to avoid double counting, to manage the transitions between land use categories and to account for each carbon pool, except those falling under a ""de minimis"" rule; outlines the specific accounting rules for land use changed from (deforested) and to (afforested) forest land; outlines the specific accounting rules for managed cropland, grassland and wetland, including categories of land changing from and to these categories; provides for accounting rules for managed forest land using a forest reference level to exclude the effects of natural and country-specific characteristics; lays down the accounting for harvested wood products; permits Member States to exclude emissions from natural disturbances (forest fire, pest invasion, etc.) from their accounts; provides for Member States to compensate for emissions from one land accounting category by removals from another land accounting category in their territory; outlines the requirements for Member States to ensure appropriate monitoring for accounting purposes, and establishes regular compliance checks by the Commission; amends Regulation No 525/2013/EU in order to ensure that the reporting requirements currently applying to LULUCF are continued within the framework of that Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited implications for the EU budget (EUR 1.668 million for the period 2017-2020). The Commission states that the indirect impacts on Member States’ budgets will depend on the choice of national policies and measures for greenhouse gas emission reductions and other mitigation action in the land use sector covered by this initiative chosen in each specific country. The proposal eliminates one (of the existing two) reporting frameworks, streamlining the process of accounting compared to that required under the Kyoto Protocol. This will reduce the administrative costs for Member States and the European Commission. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

7557EP8,"""""Copyright in the Digital Single Market""""",0.229,0.584,0.12,0.354,0.058,0.343,0.419,0.077,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to modernise certain aspects of the Union copyright framework to take account of technological developments and new channels of distribution of protected content in the internal market PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: rapid technological developments continue to transform the way works and other subject-matter are created, produced, distributed and exploited. New business models and new actors continue to emerge. The objectives and the principles laid down by the Union copyright framework remain sound. However, legal uncertainty remains, for both rightholders and users, as regards certain uses, including cross-border uses, of works and other subject matter in the digital environment. As set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards a modern, more European copyright framework’, in some areas it is necessary to adapt and supplement the current Union copyright framework to ensure that the internal market does not fragment. In this context, the Commission has identified three areas of intervention with the aim of modernising the exceptions and limitations on copyright: (i) digital and cross-border uses in the field of education, (ii) text and data mining in the field of scientific research, and (iii) preservation of cultural heritage. The objective is to guarantee the legality of certain types of uses in these fields, including across borders. Evolution of digital technologies has reinforced the role of the Internet as the main marketplace for the distribution and access to copyright-protected content. In this new framework, rightholders face difficulties when seeking to license their rights and be remunerated for the online distribution of their works. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide for measures aiming at improving the position of rightholders to negotiate and be remunerated for the exploitation of their content by online services giving access to user-uploaded content. A fair sharing of value is also necessary to ensure the sustainability of the press publications sector. This proposal is presented in parallel with : a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes; a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examines the baseline scenarios, policy options and their impacts for eight topics regrouped under three chapters, namely (i) ensuring wider access to content, (ii) adapting exceptions to digital and cross-border environment and (iii) achieving a well-functioning marketplace for copyright. The assessment concluded that, bearing in mind the predominance of SMEs in the creative sectors, the introduction of a special regime would not be appropriate, as it would defeat the purpose of the intervention. CONTENT: complementing Directive 2010/13/EU and the proposal amending it, this draft directive lays down rules which aim at further harmonising the Union law applicable to copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, taking into account in particular digital and cross-border uses of protected content. It also lays down rules on exceptions and limitations, on the facilitation of licences as well as rules aiming at ensuring a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject matter. Measures to adapt exceptions and limitations to the digital and cross-border environment : Member States are obliged to provide for mandatory exceptions or a limitation allowing: text and data mining carried out by research organisations for the purposes of scientific research; digital uses of works and other subject-matter for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching, enabling teachers and students will be able to take full advantage of digital technologies; and cultural heritage institutions ((i.e. publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives or film or audio heritage institutions) to make copies of works and other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections to the extent necessary for their preservation. Measures to improve licensing practices and ensure wider access to content: the proposal requires Member States to: put in place a legal mechanism to facilitate licensing agreements of out-of-commerce works and other subject-matter; the cross-border effects will be ensured; put in place a stakeholder dialogue on issues relating to foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms and ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders; put in place a negotiation mechanism to facilitate negotiations on the online exploitation of audiovisual works. Measures to achieve a well-functioning marketplace for copyright : the proposal provides for: a new right for press publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recoupment of their investment and the enforcement of their rights; the rights granted to the publishers of press publications under this Directive should have the same scope as the rights of reproduction and making available to the public provided for in Directive 2001/29/EC, insofar as digital uses are concerned; the possibility for all publishers to receive a share in the compensation for uses of works under an exception; measures to improve transparency and better balanced contractual relationships between authors and performers and those to whom they assign their rights; the obligation for Member States to implement negotiation and dispute resolution mechanisms."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cybersecurity is an issue of common interest of the Union. Future security depends, among others, on enhancing technological and industrial ability to protect the Union against cyber threats, as both civilian infrastructure and military capacities rely on secure digital systems. Following the 2013 cybersecurity strategy, the Union has continued to increase its activities to meet the growing challenges of cybersecurity: in 2016, the Union adopted its first measures in the area of cybersecurity through Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council on security of network and information systems; the creation in 2016 of the Public-Private Partnership (‘cPPP’) on cybersecurity in the Union was a solid first step bringing together the research, industry and public sector communities to facilitate research and innovation in cybersecurity and within the limits of the 2014-2020 financial framework should result in good, more focused outcomes in research and innovation. It will have triggered up to EUR 1.8 billion of investment by 2020; in September 2017, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy presented a joint Communication on ‘Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU’ to further reinforce the Union’s resilience, deterrence and response to cyber-attacks; at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017, Heads of State and Government called on the Union to become a global leader in the field of cybersecurity by 2025. With more than 660 cyber security competence centres throughout the EU, the EU already has considerable expertise in this area. However, the efforts of the research and industry communities are fragmented, lacking alignment and a common mission, which hinders the EU's competitiveness in this field. The Commission considers that these efforts and expertise need to be pooled, networked and used in an efficient manner to reinforce and complement existing research, technology and industrial capacities at Union and national levels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: among the main arguments in favour of the selected option were: the ability to create a real cybersecurity industrial policy by supporting activities related not only to research and development but also to market deployment; the flexibility to allow different cooperation models with the community and the network of competence centres to optimise the use of existing knowledge and resources; the ability to structure cooperation of the public and private stakeholders coming from all relevant sectors, including defence. CONTENT: this Regulation proposes to establish the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, as well as the Network of National Coordination Centres, and lays down rules for the nomination of National Coordination Centres as well as for the establishment of the Cybersecurity Competence Community. The Competence Centre : its role would be to facilitate the work of the Network of National Coordination Centres and to enhance the cybersecurity competences, by driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating access to the expertise so gathered. To this end, it would coordinate the use of cybersecurity funds under the EU's next long-term budget for the period 2021-2027 under the Digital Europe Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme. Its objectives would be: · to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, knowledge and infrastructures at the service of industries, the public sector and research communities; · to contribute to the wide deployment of the latest cyber security products and solutions across the economy; · to improve the understanding of cybersecurity and contribute to reducing skills gaps in the Union related to cybersecurity; · to contribute to the reinforcement of cybersecurity research and development in the Union; · to enhance synergies between the civilian and defence dimensions of cybersecurity. The Competence Centre would be set up as a European partnership to facilitate joint investment by the Union, Member States and/or industry. Therefore, the proposal requires Member States to contribute a commensurate amount to the actions of the Competence Centre and Network. The principal decision-making body is the Governing Board, in which all Member States take part but only those Member States which participate financially have voting rights. The Network of National Coordination Centres : each Member State would nominate a national coordination centre to lead the Network, which would focus on developing new and expanded cybersecurity capabilities and expertise. The Network would identify and support the most relevant cybersecurity projects in Member States. The Cybersecurity Competences Community : this would contribute to the mission of the Competence Centre by enhancing and disseminating cybersecurity expertise throughout the Union. It would involve a large and diverse group of actors involved in the development of cybersecurity technologies, such as research organisations, supply and demand side industries and the public sector. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union's contribution to the Competence Centre to cover administrative and operating costs includes the following elements: EUR 1 981 668 000 from the Digital Europe Programme, of which up to EUR 23 746 000 for administrative costs; EUR 2.8 billion from the Horizon Europe programme, including for administrative costs; this contribution will be proposed by the Commission during the legislative process and, in any case, before a political agreement is reached."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Rome Declaration of 25 March 2017 as well as the European Council in December 2017 stated that education and culture are key to building inclusive and cohesive societies for all, and to sustaining European competitiveness. Culture and cultural expressions manifest themselves strongly in the daily life of the Union's citizens and can contribute to wellbeing, active citizenship, common values, social inclusion and the development of intercultural dialogues as well as of a free, pluralistic and diverse media environment. The digital environment and global competition are creating new challenges for the European cultural and creative sectors. There is a highly fragmented market for cultural and creative works stemming from Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity. At the same time, the transnational circulation of works remains limited. It is therefore important to stimulate the transnational circulation and co-production of works across borders and to develop more effective solutions to reach audiences across borders. Lastly, there is a growing phenomenon of disinformation. Content industries, in particular the news media sector, are at the core of the fight to maintain a culture of healthy democratic debate. Building on the results of the 2014-2020 creative Europe programme, the Commission proposes an increase in the budget allocated to the programme in order to respond to the challenges of digitisation and globalisation by providing greater support to the European cultural and creative sectors. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the creative Europe programme for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the 2014-2020 creative Europe programme. The objectives of the proposed new programme are: enhancing the economic, social and external dimension of European level cooperation to develop and promote European cultural diversity and Europe's cultural heritage and strengthening the competitiveness of the European cultural and creative sectors and reinforcing international cultural relations; promoting the competitiveness and scalability of the European audiovisual industry; promoting policy cooperation and innovative actions , including the promotion of a diverse and pluralistic media environment, media literacy and social inclusion. The programme has three strands: (1) MEDIA (audiovisual sector) : the programme shall continue to support the production, distribution and promotion of European films, television programmes and video games. This strand shall: promote European audiovisual works and reach out to new audiences in Europe and beyond. To address these priorities, support is provided for the creation, promotion and distribution of, and access to, European works with the potential of reaching out to wide audiences in Europe and beyond. The creation of structured partnerships and networks to strengthen the competitiveness of the European audiovisual sector should also be encouraged. (2) CULTURE (cultural and creative sectors, except audiovisual) : the programme shall support cooperation projects, networks and platforms to interconnect talented artists across Europe and assist cultural and creative operators in their efforts to reach audiences across Europe. This component shall also: increase cultural participation throughout Europe; promote social inclusion through culture and cultural heritage; strengthen European identity and values through cultural awareness; contribute to the Union's global strategy for international relations through cultural diplomacy. Some existing special actions, such as the European Capital of Culture and the European Heritage Label shall be reinforced. (3) CROSS SECTORIAL STRAND : this strand shall support cross sectoral activities extending to the whole audiovisual sector and to other cultural and creative sectors. It shall promote knowledge of the programme and support transferability of results. It would also encourage innovative approaches to the creation, distribution, promotion and access to content in all sectors of culture and creation. The funds shall also be used to promote European cooperation in the field of cultural policy, with a view to fostering a free, diverse and pluralistic media environment and supporting quality journalism and media literacy. Proposed budget : EUR 1.85 billion for the period 2021-2027, according to the following indicative breakdown: MEDIA strand: up to EUR 1.08 billion; CULTURE strand: up to EUR 609 million; CROSS SECTORIAL strand: up to EUR 160 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) is the only legally binding multilateral agreement in the field of personal data protection. Convention 108 requires the Parties to incorporate into their respective national laws the necessary measures to ensure respect for the human right of all individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. At present, 51 States have ratified Convention 108, including all 28 EU Member States. Convention 108 was opened for signature in 1981, long before the era of the internet and electronic communications. The development of technology and globalisation of information poses new challenges in the field of protection of personal information. On 31 May 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to participate on behalf of the Union in the negotiations on the modernisation of the Council of Europe Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data (EST 108) and the conditions and modalities of accession of the Union to the modernised Convention. The Protocol amending Convention 108 (the amending Protocol) was adopted by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 18 May 2018 and will be open for signature as of 25 June 2018. The amending Protocol aims to widen the scope, increase the level and improve the effectiveness of data protection afforded under Convention 108. Given that the Union cannot sign or ratify the amending Protocol, as under the current Convention 108 only States are Parties, Member States should therefore be authorised to ratify the amending Protocol, acting jointly in the interests of the Union.

BACKGROUND: in view of the end of the transitional period provided for in the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom has applied to the Commission for recognition of the equivalence, from 1 January 2021, of forest reproductive material produced in that country with that produced in the EU in accordance with the respective Union law. The Commission has examined the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom. It has concluded that forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, produced in the United Kingdom is equivalent to forest reproductive material produced in the EU, since the former affords the same assurances as regards the approval of its basic material and the measures taken for its production with a view to marketing as the latter. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the Union recognises the equivalence of forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, with the respective material produced within the Union. This recognition is based on an examination of the legislation applicable in the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and systems in place are equivalent to those of the Union.

709EP7,"""""Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS-169)""""",0.702,0.857,0.895,0.645,0.455,0.843,0.872,0.857,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to allow the Community’s participation in a Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS-169) undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Baltic Sea ecosystem is seriously impacted by many natural and human-induced pressures. The sea and coasts are particularly affected by combined and increasing negative impacts from pollution, eutrophication, climate change, acidification, invasive alien species, overexploitation of living resources and loss of biodiversity. Although many research activities are taking place in the Baltic Sea region, these efforts remain, to a large degree, uncoordinated and lack a jointly agreed regional action plan. Given the limited research possibilities available at national, regional or local level to individually meet the complex environmental challenges of the Baltic Sea region as a whole, action at Community level in the Baltic Sea region is urgently called for. To respond to this, the Commission is presenting this proposal on the participation of the Community in a joint research and development programme for the Baltic (BONUS-169) to be undertaken by several Member States. By bringing together all 8 EU Baltic Sea Member States, this initiative aims to achieve sustainable coordination and cooperation among their research policies and scientific communities in tackling common European challenges and thus to make a significant contribution to the structuring of the European Research Area (ERA) in the Baltic Sea Region by removing barriers between nationally funded research programmes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three policy options have been considered for meeting the general and specific objectives of the initiative. These are: Policy option 1: continuation of policies so far developed under FP 7 (“business as usual”); Policy option 2: recourse to regionally-oriented trans-thematic call(s) under the Framework Programme; Policy option 3: recourse to Article 169 with three alternative approaches (A, B and C) varying in the extent and depth of the strategic orientation and the stakeholder involvement in the streamlining and implementation of the calls for proposals Policy option 3 through approach A  – recourse to Article 169 with a focus limited to marine research and with the immediate launching of science-driven calls for proposals, Policy option 3 through approach B  – recourse to Article 169 with a focus broadened to include the Baltic Sea drainage basin and with a strategic vision and roadmap to be developed prior to the start of the initiative and Commission proposal, Policy option 3 through approach C – recourse to Article 169 with a focus broadened to include the Baltic Sea drainage basin and with a strategic vision and roadmap developed during the first phase of the initiative. Policy option 3 through approach C is the preferred option since it can effectively address the shortcomings identified above by achieving long-lasting and durable integration at Member State, institutional and research community level. The Community contribution would ensure that truly European interest would be reflected in the working programme of the initiative, building upon, but not being limited by, activities addressed at purely national level. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to establish the participation of the Community in a Joint Baltic Sea Research Programme (BONUS-169) undertaken by all eight EU Baltic Sea Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) in support of the Baltic Sea region’s sustainable development. There will be scope for participation of the Russian Federation in the Joint Research Programme provided that the necessary legal requirements are met. BONUS-169 will provide scientific outputs to facilitate the implementation of ecosystem-based management in the Baltic Sea region and support the development and implementation of 'fit-for-purpose' ecosystem-based regulations, policies and management practices aimed at safeguarding the sustainable use of the ecosystem’s goods and services. BONUS-169 will integrate the national research programmes and activities of the 8 Baltic Sea States into a single joint research programme and support, in particular, the research and environmental objectives of the Baltic Sea Strategy (see COM(2009)0248), the Marine and Maritime Strategy and the Water Framework Directive. In order to reach its objectives, BONUS-169 will be implemented in two distinct phases: an initial strategic phase , lasting two years, during which appropriate consultation platforms for active stakeholder involvement will be set-up, a strategic research agenda prepared, and precise implementation modalities will be further broadened and developed; an implementation phase , of minimum 5 years, during which a minimum of three joint calls will be launched in view of funding strategically targeted BONUS-169 projects specifically addressing the objectives of the initiative. Since the future success of BONUS-169 will depend to a large extent upon the achievement of the objectives set out for the strategic phase, the Commission will evaluate the maturity and readiness of the initiative and, provided that the results of the evaluation of are positive, the Commission and the BONUS EEIG shall conclude the implementation agreement. The participating states have agreed that the Baltic Organisations Network for Funding Science, BONUS EEIG, established in Helsinki, Finland, will be the dedicated BONUS-169 implementation structure. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary implications of this horizontal proposal are already mentioned in the legal basis of FP7 as well as in the ""Cooperation"" Specific Programme of FP7. The agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the dedicated implementation structure shall ensure that the financial interests of the Community are protected. The Community shall make a financial contribution of up to EUR 50 million for all the duration of BONUS-169 shall match the contribution of the participating states, bringing the total expected budget for the initiative to EUR 100 million. The strategic phase will be implemented by a grant according to the rules set out in this Decision and on Regulation (EC) no 1906/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in actions under the Seventh Framework Programme and for the dissemination of research results (2007-2013). For 2010, the contribution from DG RTD for the strategic phase will amount to EUR 1.25 million (the participating states have to contribute an equivalent amount). The implementation phase will be implemented by indirect centralised management, according to the provisions of Art. 54(2) (c) of the Financial Regulation. According to the Financial Regulation, the Commission will first obtain evidence of the existence and proper operation of, inter-alia, grant-award procedures, an internal control system, an adequate accounting system within the entity to which it entrusts implementation, and an independent external audit."

PROPOSED ACT: European Council Decision. BACKGROUND: Article 2(1) and (2) of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions will expire at the end of the 2009-2014 parliamentary term. It is necessary to comply without delay with the provisions of Article 2(3) of Protocol No 36 and therefore to adopt the decision provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union, in order to enable Member States to enact in good time the necessary domestic measures for organising the elections to the European Parliament for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term. The first subparagraph of Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union lays down the criteria for the composition of the European Parliament, namely: (i) that representatives of the Union's citizens are not to exceed 750, plus the President, (ii) that representation is to be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of 6 members per Member State, and (iii) that no Member State is to be allocated more than 96 seats. LEGAL BASIS: Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). CONTENT: by applying the principle of degressive proportionality provided for by the Treaty on European Union, it is proposed to establish the number of representatives in the European Parliament elected in each Member States for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term as follows: Belgium : 21 Bulgaria : 17 Czech Republic : 21 Denmark : 13 Germany : 96 Estonia : 6 Ireland : 11 Greece : 21 Spain : 54 France : 74 Croatia : 11 Italy : 73 Cyprus : 6 Latvia : 8 Lithuania : 11 Luxembourg : 6 Hungary : 21 Malta : 6 Netherlands : 26 Austria : 18 Poland : 51 Portugal : 21 Romania : 32 Slovenia : 8 Slovakia : 13 Finland : 13 Sweden : 20 United Kingdom : 73. It is proposed that this Decision shall be revised sufficiently far in advance of the beginning of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term on the basis of an initiative of the European Parliament presented before the end of 2016 with the aim of establishing a system which in future will make it possible, before each fresh election to the European Parliament, to allocate the seats between Member States in an objective, fair, durable and transparent way. The allocation should respect the principle of degressive proportionality, taking account of any change in their number and demographic trends in their population, as duly ascertained thus respecting the overall balance of the institutional system."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: before a vehicle may be put on the market, it has to fulfil all the relevant type or individual approval requirements guaranteeing an optimal level of safety and environmental standards. Following this approval, cars on the road have to be regularly submitted to periodic roadworthiness tests. The goal of roadworthiness testing is to check the functionality of safety components, the environmental performance and the compliance of a vehicle with its approval. The proposal aims at contributing to reach the target of a reduction of road fatalities by half until 2020 as laid down in the Policy Orientations on Road Safety 2011-2020. It will also contribute to the reduction of emissions in road transport linked to poor maintenance of vehicles, following the European Strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles as well as the integrated energy and climate change policy. The proposal is part of a package of measures which also includes: a proposal on the amendment of Directive 1999/37/EC on registration documents for vehicles and a proposal for a regulation on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the following options were considered: Option 1: the 'No policy change' approach where the present EU legal framework would be maintained; Option 2: the ""Soft law approach"" would consist in both better implementation and better monitoring of the application of existing legislation; Option 3: the ""Legislative approach"" would be based on two components: (a) revising upwards the minimum EU standards for periodic roadworthiness tests (PTI) and unexpected roadside inspections (RSI) and define mandatory standards; (b) in a second phase, the possible establishment of and EU harmonised data exchange system linking the existing databases. The impact assessment has shown the benefits of a combination of a soft-law approach with a regulatory approach. Therefore, the soft-law measures have been integrated into the legislative texts. LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the ""Roadworthiness Package"" will carry over the existing requirements laid down in the existing legislative framework related to the roadworthiness regime, which covers roadworthiness tests (Directive 2009/40/EC), roadside inspections (Directive 2000/30/EC) and rules on the registration of vehicles (Directive 1999/37/EC). The main objective of the proposal is to provide for a risk-rating system aimed at focusing inspections on vehicles operated by undertaking with poor safety records, thus rewarding vehicles operated by undertakings that are mindful of safety and the environment. The main points of the proposal are as follows: Scope : light commercial vehicles and their trailers will be included into the scope of roadside test activities as this group of vehicles does not follow the downward trend in road fatalities. Roadside inspections : to distribute better the roadside inspections by Member States a percentage of the number of registered commercial vehicles shall be inspected every year. The total percentage will not exceed the number of roadworthiness tests already performed in the Union. The selection of vehicles shall be based on the risk profile of the operators and target high risk undertakings to reduce the burden on the operators that maintain their vehicles in a proper way. Company profiling shall be based on the results of previous roadworthiness tests and roadside inspections similar. More elaborated roadside inspections shall be performed using testing equipment either by mobile inspection units or at test centres in close vicinity. The securing of cargo should be included in the roadside checks. Deficiencies detected shall be assessed according to harmonised rules related to their risk. Training and qualifications : the level of knowledge and skills of inspectors performing roadside inspectors shall meet at least the level of those conducting roadworthiness tests. National contact points : cooperation and exchange of information between Member States and with the Commission will be performed more efficiently via designated points of contact in the Member States. Commission’s powers : the Commission shall be empowered to update the annexes to technical progress via delegated acts and to maintain the certificates and reporting forms in close cooperation with Member States via implementing acts including inter alia alternative test procedures based upon modern emission after-treatment systems for checking the in use NOx and particulate emissions conformity which are still under development. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in January 2017, Croatia notified the Commission on recent changes of its domestic insolvency law introducing new types of insolvency proceedings, such as a pre-insolvency proceeding and a consumer's insolvency proceeding. At the same time, Croatia requested that the list setting out exhaustively the insolvency proceedings in Annex A of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 be amended accordingly. The Commission carefully analysed this request in order to ensure compliance of the notification with the requirements of the Regulation. Changes to Annex A of the Regulation do not affect the substantive set of rules and may only be made by the Union legislature and not by the Member States.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. CONTENT: on 16 July 2009, Iceland presented its application to the Council to become a member of the European Union. The General Affairs Council in its session on 27 July 2009, recalling the renewed consensus on enlargement expressed in the conclusions of the European Council of 14/15 December 2006, and particularly the principle that each applicant country is assessed on its own merits, decided to implement the procedure laid down in Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union. Accordingly, the Commission was invited to submit to the Council its opinion on Iceland's application. Pending the presentation of the Commission's opinion to the Council, Iceland can be considered as a potential candidate country. It is therefore necessary to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) in order to enable Iceland to benefit from the assistance provided under the umbrella of IPA for the potential candidate countries. The proposed amendments are as follows: the first amendment is introduced in Annex II and foresees including Iceland in the list of potential candidate countries; secondly, an amendment is introduced in Article 4. This Article stipulates that assistance under the regulation is provided in accordance with the general policy framework for pre-accession defined by the European and Accession Partnerships and taking due account of the Reports and the Strategy Paper comprised in the annual Enlargement package of the Commission. Considering that the European and Accession Partnerships have been designed particularly for the Western Balkans and Turkey to provide guidance for EU integration and harmonisation with acquis, and the fact that Iceland is integrated in the European Economic Area, it is necessary to introduce a minor amendment to Article 4, notably by adding a paragraph which specifies that support to Iceland is provided only on the basis of the Reports and Strategy Paper comprised in the annual Enlargement package of the Commission. This amendment will exclude the application of the European and Accession Partnerships to Iceland. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: not applicable. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: not applicable."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: by Decision of 30 November 2009, the Council concluded the agreement between the European Community and the Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver. Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and the Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition. With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with the Bahamas were successfully finalised by the initialling of the amending agreement on 30 August 2016. CONTENT: this proposal is presented to the Council to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Agreement between the European Community and the Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver. The amendments introduced by the final agreement cover the following points: Duration of stay: the final agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the Bahamas when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). A joint statement on the interpretation of the 90-day period over any 180-day period is attached to the amending agreement. Suspension of the agreement: the agreement provides that suspension of the waiver shall be lifted if the suspension is no longer required. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Community and the Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver remain unaffected by the amending agreement, including the territorial scope. The provisions of the agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes a common system for the control of exports of dual-use items in accordance with the international commitments and obligations of the Member States and the EU. Under this regulation, an authorisation is required for the export of dual-use items to third countries. This authorisation may take the form of an individual, global or general authorisation. In particular, Annex IIa to the Regulation provides for a Union General Export Authorisation (“EU001”) for certain low-risk transactions, e.g. exports to Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland (incl. Liechtenstein), and the United States of America. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU has consequences for trade in dual-use items between the EU and the UK: under Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, the export of dual-use items from the EU to the UK will, as from 1 January 2021, require an export authorisation issued by the national competent authority of the Member State where the exporter is established. This would create a considerable administrative burden for the competent authorities of the Member States and for EU exporters, which would be detrimental to their competitiveness. CONTENT: in order to avoid disproportionate trade disruptions and an excessive administrative burden for exports of dual-use items from the EU to the UK, it is proposed to add the UK to Annex IIa of the Regulation and thus to control exports to the UK under EU General Export Authorisation No EU001. The addition of the United Kingdom to the list of countries covered by EU General Export Authorisation EU001 should not have a negative impact on EU and international security, while ensuring uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the Union and ensuring a level playing field for EU exporters. This proposal is consistent with the general approach to contingency measures to address a withdrawal of the United Kingdom without agreement."
5148EP7,"""""European grouping of territorial cooperation""""",0.509,0.894,0.912,0.581,0.424,0.952,0.918,0.429,0,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to define the next framework for cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020 (clarification, simplification and improvement of the establishment and implementation of European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC). PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 on a European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC), the Commission adopted on 29 July 2011 a Report on the application of the aforementioned Regulation . In that Report, the Commission announced its intention to propose a limited number of modifications to the EGTC Regulation to facilitate the establishment and operation of EGTCs, as well as clarification of certain existing provisions. Obstacles to establishing new EGTCs should be removed while maintaining continuity in and facilitating the operation of existing ones, thus allowing more extensive use of EGTCs to contribute to better cooperation and policy coherence among public bodies without additional burden on national or European administrations. This proposal is part of a package of legislative measures relating to the Cohesion policy 2014-2020. This package includes: an overarching regulation setting out common rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). This will allow for the better combination of funds for a stronger impact of EU action; three specific regulations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; two regulations dealing with the European territorial cooperation goal and the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC); two regulations on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) and the Programme for Social Change and Innovation; a communication on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. The Regulation draws on extensive consultation with stakeholders, including Member States, regions and members of existing and planned EGTCs. The message from all groups, and most especially the active EGTCs and those under preparation, was clear: the instrument is useful and has potential going beyond its anticipated functions, but the procedures for operating and especially setting up EGTCs are more complex and uncertain than they should be. LEGAL BASIS: the third subparagraph of Article 175 in conjunction with Articles 209(1) and 212(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this amending Regulation makes changes, on the one hand, to respect the terminology introduced by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and on the other hand in response to the weaknesses and areas of potential improvement identified in the Report referred to above.  The philosophy behind the changes can be expressed in three keywords: Continuity; Clarity; Flexibility. These changes concern: membership : the proposal employs new legal bases to permit regions and bodies in non-Member States to be members of an EGTC, whether the other members are from one or many Member States. The eligibility of membership of bodies under private law is also clarified; the content of the Convention and Statutes of an EGTC, its purpose : under the proposal, the convention and statutes of an EGTC are re-defined and the distinction in approval procedure underlined; the process of approval by national authorities : the proposal stipulates that th e criteria for approval or rejection by national authorities are specified, and a limited time for examination proposed (this is the single most frequently heard complaint from existing and planned EGTCs); applicable law for employment and for procurement : s olutions, in line with the acquis of the Union, are proposed for tax and social security regimes for employees of an EGTC, who may be employed in any of the Member States whose territories comprise the EGTC. A similar approach is proposed for procurement rules; liability : where some local or regional bodies are required by their national laws to have limited liability and others, in different Member States, are required to have unlimited liability, an insurance-based solution modelled on that used for European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERIC) is proposed; more transparent procedures for communication : Member States will be required to inform the Commission of any provisions adopted to implement the EGTC Regulation, as amended, and each newly established EGTC should inform the Commission of its purpose and membership, for publication in the Official Journal (C Series). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EGTC Regulation is not a financial regulation and carries no budgetary implications for the Union or for Member States. EGTCs may be funded by local, regional or national funds and may carry out actions that are co-funded by European funds. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. The Erasmus+ programme supports actions in the fields of education and training, youth and sport. Every year, it provides nearly 800 000 people the opportunity to benefit from learning or training abroad. Mobility activities can last up to 12 months. The Commission estimates that by the time the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland withdraws from the European Union, there will be almost 14 000 learners from EU-27 post-Brexit (students and trainees in higher education and vocational education and training, young learners, educational staff) in the United Kingdom and some 7 000 learners from the United Kingdom within EU-27 post-Brexit. In the absence of an agreement, the current participants would not be able to complete their Erasmus+ semester, and may no longer benefit from scholarships. Many students would lose their university credits and be forced to repeat their semester or academic year, which would have a disruptive effect both on the students themselves and on their home and host institutions. Urgent measures are needed to avoid disruption of mobility activities for education and training purposes under Erasmus+ in which the United Kingdom participates at the time of its withdrawal from the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation ensures that, in the absence of a withdrawal agreement, young people from the European Union and the United Kingdom participating in the Erasmus+ programme as of 30 March 2019 shall be able to complete their stay without interruption, complete their studies and continue to receive the corresponding funding or grants. For the purposes of the continuation of financing of ongoing learning mobility activities from the Union budget, the Commission and the United Kingdom should agree to allow the exercise of controls and audits of the respective activities. If the necessary controls and audits cannot be carried out, this should be considered a serious deficiency in the management and control system. This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the crisis caused by the COVID 19 epidemic is increasing the risks for the most vulnerable, in particular the most deprived, and may in particular disrupt the support provided by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The distribution of food and basic material assistance, as well as social inclusion support, is facing increasingly logistical and human resource constraints, notably due to the confinement and urgent need to instate social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus. Many of the volunteers, who are the backbone of the Fund, can no longer be mobilised, as they often belong to groups at a higher risk of severe illness caused by COVID-19. The Fund's main objective is to support the development of the country's capacity to provide food and basic material assistance. Specific measures must be taken as a matter of urgency in order to protect the most vulnerable from this disease and to ensure that they continue to receive assistance from the FEAD, in particular with regard to the provision of the necessary protective equipment against the disease. This initiative complements the first ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’, a package of measures proposed by the Commission on 13 March 2020 which introduced a number of important changes to provide a more effective response to the current situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in order to address the difficulties encountered by public authorities and partner organisations in implementing the FEAD during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific measures The proposed measures provide for the following:  eligibility of expenditure incurred from 1 February 2020 for FEAD operations that strengthen the capacity to respond to the coronavirus pandemic; the possibility to give Member States the exceptional possibility to apply for a co-financing rate of 100% for the accounting year 2020-2021; flexibility for Member States (i) to adjust the schemes of support to the current context, including by allowing alternative schemes of delivery through electronic vouchers (lower risk of contamination) and by allowing Member States (ii) to amend certain elements of the operational programme without requiring an adoption by Commission decision; possibility to provide the necessary protective materials and equipment to partner organisations outside the technical assistance budget; flexibility measures which reduce the administrative burden on the authorities in terms of compliance with certain legislative requirements, in particular as regards monitoring and control and audit; specific provisions regarding the eligibility of costs incurred by beneficiaries in case the delivery of food/basic material assistance or social assistance is delayed as well as for suspended and not fully implemented operations. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments set out in the FEAD Regulation. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived remains unchanged. The proposal will facilitate an acceleration of programme implementation and result in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission will carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts."
6154EP7,"""""Protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data""""",0.825,0.817,0.947,0.484,0.606,0.855,0.826,0.857,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to protect individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: t he centrepiece of existing EU legislation on personal data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was adopted in 1995 with two objectives in mind: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data between Member States. It was complemented by Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA as a general instrument at Union level for the protection of personal data in the areas of police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. The current legal framework remains sound as far as its objectives and principles are concerned, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the way personal data protection is implemented across the Union, legal uncertainty and a widespread public perception that there are significant risks associated notably with online activity. This is why it is time to build a stronger and more coherent data protection framework in the EU, backed by strong enforcement that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Personal data protection therefore plays a central role in the Digital Agenda for Europe, and more generally in the Europe 2020 Strategy. Article 16(1) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) , as introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, establishes the principle that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In 2010, the European Council invited the Commission to evaluate the functioning of EU instruments on data protection and to present, where necessary, further legislative and non-legislative initiatives. The Commission stressed in its Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme the need to ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is consistently applied in the context of all EU policies. In its Communication on “ A comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the European Union ”, the Commission concluded that the EU needs a more comprehensive and coherent policy on the fundamental right to personal data protection. The European Parliament approved by its resolution of 6 July 2011 a report that supported the Commission’s approach to reforming the data protection framework. This proposal further details the approach for the new legal framework for the protection of personal data in the EU as presented in its Communication on this issue. The legal framework consists of two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of improving the internal market dimension of data protection, making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence, including police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Three policy options of different degrees of intervention were assessed: Option 1 : this option consisted of minimal legislative amendments and the use of interpretative Communications and policy support measures such as funding programmes and technical tools; Option 2 : this option comprised a set of legislative provisions addressing each of the issues identified in the analysis and Option 3 : this option was the centralisation of data protection at EU level through precise and detailed rules for all sectors and the establishment of an EU agency for monitoring and enforcement of the provisions. The analysis of the overall impact led to the development of the preferred policy option which is based on the second option with some elements from the other two options and incorporated in the present proposal. According to the impact assessment, its implementation will lead inter alia to considerable improvements regarding legal certainty for data controllers and citizens, reduction of administrative burden, consistency of data protection enforcement in the Union, the effective possibility of individuals to exercise their data protection rights to the protection of personal data within the EU and the efficiency of data protection supervision and enforcement. LEGAL BASIS: Article 16(2) and Article 114(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. It protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. It main provisions are as follows: Principles : the proposal sets out the principles relating to personal data processing. Additional new elements are in particular the transparency principle, the clarification of the data minimisation principle and the establishment of a comprehensive responsibility and liability of the controller. It also sets out the criteria for lawful processing, which are further specified as regards the balance of interest criterion, and the compliance with legal obligations and public interest. It clarifies the conditions for consent to be valid as a legal ground for lawful processing and sets out further conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data of children in relation to information society services offered directly to them. Rights of the data subject : the proposal introduces the obligation on controllers to provide transparent and easily accessible and understandable information. It obliges the controller to provide procedures and mechanism for exercising the data subject's rights, including means for electronic requests, requiring response to the data subject's request within a defined deadline, and the motivation of refusals. In addition, the proposal: further specifies the controller's information obligations towards the data subject, providing additional information to the data subject, including on the storage period, the right to lodge a complaint, in relation to international transfers and to the source from which the data are originating; provides the data subject's right of access to their personal data, such as to inform the data subjects of the storage period, and of the rights to rectification and to erasure and to lodge a complaint; sets out the data subject's right to rectification; provides the data subject's right to be forgotten and to erasure. It further elaborates and specifies the right of erasure provided for in Article 12(b) of Directive 95/46/EC; introduces the data subject's right to data portability, i.e. to transfer data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the controller. As a precondition and in order to further improve access of individuals to their personal data, it provides the right to obtain from the controller those data in a structured and commonly used electronic format; provides for the data subject's rights to object; concerns the data subject's right not to be subject to a measure based on profiling. General obligations : the proposal takes account of the debate on a ""principle of accountability"" and describes in detail the obligation of responsibility of the controller to comply with this Regulation and to demonstrate this compliance, including by way of adoption of internal policies and mechanisms for ensuring such compliance. It sets out the obligations of the controller arising from the principles of data protection by design and by default. It introduces for controllers and processors: (i) the obligation for controllers and processors to maintain documentation of the processing operations under their responsibility, instead of a general notification to the supervisory authority; (ii) the obligation to implement appropriate measures for the security of processing; (iii) an obligation to notify personal data breaches; (iv) the obligation of controllers and processors to carry out a data protection impact assessment prior to risky processing operations. Data protection officer : the proposal introduces a mandatory data protection officer for the public sector, and, in the private sector, for large enterprises or where the core activities of the controller or processor consist of processing operations which require regular and systematic monitoring. Transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations : the proposal spells out, as a general principle, that the compliance with the obligations in that chapter are mandatory for any transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations, including onward transfers. It sets out the criteria, conditions and procedures for the adoption of an adequacy decision by the Commission. The criteria which shall be taken into account for the Commission’s assessment of an adequate or not adequate level of protection include expressly the rule of law, judicial redress and independent supervision. The proposal requires for transfers to third countries, where no adequacy decision has been adopted by the Commission, to adduce appropriate safeguards, in particular standard data protection clauses, binding corporate rules and contractual clauses. Independent supervisory authorities : the proposal obliges Member States to establish supervisory authorities and to enlarge the mission of the supervisory authorities to co-operation with each other and with the Commission. It clarifies the conditions for the independence of supervisory authorities, implementing case law by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Co-operation and consistency : the proposal introduces explicit rules on mandatory mutual assistance, including consequences for non-compliance with the request of another supervisory authority. It introduces a consistency mechanism for ensuring unity of application in relation to processing operations which may concern data subjects in several Member States. The proposal also establishes the European Data Protection Board, consisting of the heads of the supervisory authority of each Member State and of the European Data Protection Supervisor. The European Data Protection Board replaces the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data set up under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC. Remedies, liability and sanctions : the proposal provides: (i) for the right of any data subject to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (ii) that the bodies, organisations or associations which may lodge a complaint on behalf of the data subject and also in case of a personal data breach independently of a data subject's complaint; (iii) for the right to a judicial remedy against a supervisory authority; (iv) the data subject may launch a court action for obliging the supervisory authority to act on a complaint; (v) the right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor; (vi) for the introduction of common rules for court proceedings, including the rights of bodies, organisations or associations to represent data subjects before the courts, and the right of supervisory authorities to engage in legal proceedings; (vii) for the Member States to provide for the right to compensation and lay down rules on penalties, to sanction infringements of the Directive, and to ensure their implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to the tasks allocated to the European Data Protection Supervisor as specified in the legislative financial statements accompanying this proposal. These implications require reprogramming of Heading 5 of the Financial Perspective. The total appropriations are estimated at EUR 24.339 million for 2014-2020. The proposal has no implications on operational expenditure. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: cap and trade systems are policy tools that cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union has been implementing its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS-EU) for more than ten years. The development of a well-functioning international carbon market through bottom-up linking of emissions trading systems is a long term policy goal of the EU and the international community, notably as a means to achieve climate objectives, including under the Paris Agreement. Linking enhances the cost-efficiency of emissions trading. The Directive establishing the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) allows for the EU ETS to be linked with other emissions trading systems provided they are mandatory, have an absolute cap on emissions and are compatible. In 2010, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Switzerland for a link between the EU and the Swiss greenhouse gas emissions trading systems. Overall, the design of the Swiss ETS is very similar to that of the EU ETS: the same gases and industry sectors are covered, with equal inclusion thresholds; definition of the liable entities at installation level; compatible allocation methodologies; similarity of quantitative and qualitative standards for international credits; same compliance periods (2013-2020). In addition, like the EU ETS, the Swiss ETS is currently undergoing review for its next period from 2021 to 2030. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the agreement between the EU and Switzerland on the linking of their greenhouse gas emission allowance trading schemes. In concrete terms, the agreement:"

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. LEGAL BASE: Article 114 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 80/720/EEC of 24 June 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. This proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."
643EP7,"""""Standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation""""",0.772,0.883,0.877,0.613,0.455,0.94,0.867,0.771,1,0,0,0,"PURPOSE: to ensure that human organs used for transplantation in the EU comply with the same quality and safety requirements and to facilitate their exchange between Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: over the past 50 years organ transplantation has become an established worldwide practice, bringing immense benefits to hundreds of thousands of patients. Organ transplantation is now the most cost-effective treatment for end-stage renal failure, while for end-stage failure of organs such as the liver, lung and heart it is the only available treatment. The shortage of organs is a major factor affecting transplantation programmes. Nearly 56 000 patients are now on waiting lists in the EU. Mortality rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15 to 30%. Donation rates and availability of organs varies considerably across Europe with achievable good practice delivering far greater benefits in some Member States than in others. On 31 May 2007, the Commission adopted a Communication on organ donation and transplantation based on that analysis. This Communication proposes what activities the EU should undertake in the field of organ transplantation. In December 2007, the Council adopted conclusions on organ donation and transplantation which recognised the importance of having high standards with respect to the quality and safety of organs for transplantation, so as to ensure a high level of protection for patients throughout Europe. The Council called on the Commission to consult the Member States, and continue its examination of the need for an EU framework on quality and safety for human organs. The European Parliament resolution adopted on 22 April 2008 recognised that it is vitally important to improve the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation to reduce transplant risks. It invited the Commission to present a proposal for a directive stipulating requirements to ensure the quality and safety of organ donation across the EU. CONTENT: this proposal for a Directive covers human organs, that are used for transplantation, during all the phases of the process – donation, procurement, testing, preservation, transport and use – and aims to ensure their quality and safety and hence a high level of health protection. Organs that are transplanted into the human body in clinical trials should comply with the quality and safety standards laid down in this Directive. The added value of the Directive: Ensuring quality and safety for patients at EU level : this Directive sets out the basic quality and safety requirements needed in every transplant system. More specifically, the proposal: provides for the creation or designation of a competent national authority in each Member State which will ensure compliance with the requirements of the Directive; establishes a system for the authorisation of programmes of organ procurement and transplantation based on common quality and safety criteria. This system would provide a complete list of authorised centres throughout the European Union, accessible to the public and professionals alike; establishes common quality and safety standards for the processes of evaluating donors and human organs, thus ensuring the health of recipients; proposes the introduction of national quality programmes to ensure continuous monitoring of performance and improvement and learning; ensures that Member States put in place organ traceability systems. The Commission will adopt procedures for guaranteeing full traceability of organs exchanged between Member States; includes measures to capture serious adverse events related to the procurement, testing and transport of organs, as well as any serious adverse reactions observed during or after transplantation which may be connected to the procurement, testing and transport of the organ in the European Union. The Commission will adopt procedures for ensuring interoperability between the reporting systems on adverse events and reactions. Ensuring the protection of donors : the proposed Directive contains a number of measures to protect living donors. These include correct evaluation of the health of the donor and comprehensive information about the risks prior to donation, the introduction of registers for living donors to follow up their health and measures to ensure the altruistic and voluntary donation of organs by living donors. Facilitating cooperation between Member States and cross-border exchanges : the Directive will: i) put in place the quality and safety conditions needed to facilitate cross-border exchanges; ii) standardise the collection of the relevant information on the characteristics of the organ needed to make a proper risk assessment; iii) establish a mechanism for transmission of the information; iv) provide for the necessary mechanisms to be put in place for cross-border exchanges of organs to ensure traceability of the organ and pre-empt serious adverse reporting."
